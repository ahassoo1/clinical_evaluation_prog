DOCTOR: Hi Jase, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Roseburrough, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent, you know? I think it might be something to do with… something I was told a long time ago about my gut, but honestly, I don’t really remember the details. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent diarrhea. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say “a bit now,” roughly how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Gosh, it feels like… maybe a couple of weeks? Possibly a month? It comes and goes, so it’s hard to say exactly. Some days are worse than others, definitely. It’s not constantly happening, but it’s often enough that it’s… annoying. And a bit worrying, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of weeks to a month, with varying intensity. That helps. Can you describe what the diarrhea is like?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s… watery, mostly. Not… solid, obviously. Sorry, that’s probably too much information. And sometimes there’s… cramping beforehand. Not always, but often. It doesn’t usually have a… bad smell, I don’t think? I haven’t really been paying that close attention, to be honest. It just feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery stools with some cramping. No noticeable foul odor. And it's causing you discomfort. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Blood? No, I haven’t seen any blood. And… tarry stools? What does that even look like? I really don’t think so, but I honestly haven’t been… examining it that closely, if you don’t mind me saying. Sorry. I just… go to the bathroom, and try to forget about it, you know? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all. Many people prefer not to focus on it! Tarry stools are very dark, almost black, and sticky – they indicate digested blood, which is why I ask. Since you haven’t noticed that, that’s good. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t been sick, like… throwing up. I feel a bit tired sometimes, but I just thought that was… life, you know? Work and everything. I haven’t really connected it to my stomach problems. And no, no nausea either. Just… the diarrhea, and the occasional cramping.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diarrhea and occasional cramping, no fever, vomiting, nausea, or blood in your stool. You mentioned something about being told a long time ago about your gut. Do you remember anything about what that was?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is the hard part. It was… a long time ago, when I was a kid, I think. Something about… not being able to eat certain things? And it causing problems with my tummy. I think they said a name… IBD? Or… celiac? Something like that. My mum handled most of the appointments, so I didn’t really pay attention. It’s all very vague, I’m sorry. I just remember having to be careful about what I ate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially IBD or celiac disease, and some dietary restrictions in the past. That's helpful, even if vague. Let's check your medical records to see if we can find anything more specific. ...Okay, it looks like you were evaluated for celiac disease at age 8, and the results were negative. There’s no mention of IBD. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good to know, actually. Negative for celiac. That’s one less thing to worry about, I suppose. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t ever had a really bad reaction to anything, not like… swelling or trouble breathing. I’m not sure if I’m allergic to pollen or something, but I don't take anything for allergies. Just… normal sniffles sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and negative celiac test. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. Just… occasionally I take paracetamol for headaches, if I have one. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I’ve been a bit slack with that lately. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Oh! And I use an inhaler sometimes, for… just a little bit of asthma, but it’s not very bad. I don't use it every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional paracetamol for headaches, a multivitamin sometimes, and an inhaler for mild asthma. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your diet. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not drastically. I've been trying to eat a bit healthier, maybe? More vegetables. But nothing major. I still eat pretty much the same things I always have. I did have a really spicy curry a couple of days ago… but I eat spicy food all the time, so I didn’t think that would be it. My husband made it, and it was delicious!
DOCTOR: Okay, no major dietary changes, you've been trying to eat healthier, and you recently had a spicy curry. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sure, go ahead. I’m a bit nervous, but… I trust you. Let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, just listening to your bowel sounds now... They're a little bit hyperactive, which can be common with diarrhea. And I'm gently pressing on your abdomen... Do you feel any pain or tenderness in any particular area?
PATIENT: No, not really. Ooh, that’s a little… sensitive, actually. Just there, on the left side. Not painful, exactly, but… yeah, definitely more sensitive than anywhere else. It feels… kind of crampy there, even when you’re not pressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness and cramping on the left side of your abdomen. That could be related to your bowel activity or possibly some mild inflammation. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me – the persistent diarrhea, occasional cramping, negative celiac test, and the tenderness I found – it sounds like you might be experiencing a flare-up of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a stool test to check for any infections or parasites. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: IBS… that sounds familiar. Is that… serious? A stool test… okay, yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps to figure things out, then yes, please. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I’m getting a bit tired of being worried about where the nearest bathroom is all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. IBS is not serious in the sense that it’s not life-threatening, but it can definitely be disruptive and uncomfortable. It’s a chronic condition, meaning it comes and goes, and it’s often managed with dietary changes, stress reduction, and sometimes medication. Okay, I’m ordering the stool test now. The lab will send you instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s pretty straightforward. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a food diary to see if you can identify any trigger foods. Also, try to stay well-hydrated and manage your stress levels. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation if needed?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, I think. Chronic, but manageable. I can definitely try the food diary. And yes, please. A referral to a gastroenterologist would be good, just in case. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Thank you, Dr. Roseburrough. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a bit less worried now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. I'm sending the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma – she’s excellent. The lab will contact you to schedule the stool test. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you again, Dr. Roseburrough. I really appreciate your time and patience. I’ll wait for the lab to contact me, and I'll start the food diary today.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You have a good day, Jase. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns.
