DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's good to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can go. Just a form filled out by a doctor, you see. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Squiers. A pre-travel medical clearance form. Quite common. We’ll certainly be happy to complete that for you. To do so accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I was widowed five years ago, and my husband, God rest his soul, had a touch of high blood pressure, but I never have. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox, all that – but nothing… serious, as you say, as an adult. I do get a bit of arthritis in my hands, especially in the cold weather, but it’s not too bad. Just a bit stiff, you know? And I had my appendix out when I was twenty-two. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Ms. Squiers. So, no high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or asthma currently. Arthritis in your hands, and an appendectomy at age twenty-two. That gives us a good starting point. And just to be thorough, are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all – that are concerning you?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Truthfully, I feel quite well. A bit tired sometimes, as anyone my age does, but nothing I’d call concerning. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I wear glasses, of course, and I get the occasional headache, but that’s usually just if I’m stressed or haven’t had enough water. Nothing… alarming, you understand. I wouldn't be going on a cruise if I was feeling poorly!
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Squiers. It's good to hear you’re feeling well overall. Glasses for vision, and occasional headaches related to stress or dehydration – noted. Now, let’s briefly review some systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight – either loss or gain – that weren't intentional?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My weight has been… steady, I’d say. Perhaps a pound or two up or down depending on the time of year, but nothing drastic. I'm about ten stone, give or take. I enjoy a good piece of shortbread, you see, so it fluctuates a bit! But I haven't been trying to lose or gain any weight. I haven’t changed my diet recently, either. Same as always, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Squiers. No unintentional weight changes, and a stable diet. And have you been having any difficulty with your digestion – things like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My digestion is… regular, shall we say. I haven’t had any trouble with any of those things. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, which helps, I think! And I make sure to eat my vegetables. A sensible diet is important, you know. No problems there at all, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I do wake up a couple of times a night, more than I used to. It’s not a problem, exactly. Just… old age, I suppose. I get up, read for a bit, then go back to sleep. It doesn't leave me feeling terribly tired in the morning, but it is different than it used to be. I wouldn’t say it’s keeping me up all night, mind you. Just a little… interrupted.
DOCTOR: Interrupted sleep, waking a couple of times a night. Not causing significant fatigue. Okay. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I used to take something for the arthritis, years ago, but I stopped. I find a warm bath and a bit of gentle exercise are more helpful. Just a bit of ibuprofen now and then if it gets particularly bad, but that’s it. Nothing regularly, I assure you. I prefer to keep things natural, if possible.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Squiers. No regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her gardening, and I’ve never been bothered by pollen or anything like that. I eat most things without issue. I’m quite fortunate, really. No allergies at all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Ms. Squiers. Thank you for providing that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam just to complete the cruise line's requirements and ensure there are no underlying issues we need to address. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I have no objections at all. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. A quick look won’t bother me a bit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ears appear normal, tympanic membranes are intact. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I’m glad everything seems to be alright. I was a little worried about having to fill out all those forms, but it sounds like I’m in good health. Is there anything else you need to do?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Squiers, that was all I needed. Based on the information you've provided and the findings of the physical exam, there are no medical contraindications preventing you from taking your cruise. I’ll complete the cruise line’s medical form for you now. Just to summarise, you have no significant medical conditions, no current medications, and no known allergies. Your physical exam was normal, and we’ve documented that you’re in good health. Here you are. This should satisfy the cruise line’s requirements. Is there anything I can answer for you before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much! That’s a great weight off my mind. No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind, and I appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions. I’m very grateful for your help. I can finally get on with planning the rest of my trip!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. It was my pleasure. Enjoy your cruise to the Mediterranean – it sounds like a lovely trip! If you experience any new or concerning symptoms before or during your travels, please don't hesitate to consult a medical professional. Have a safe and enjoyable time! And if you need anything in the future, please feel free to schedule another appointment.
