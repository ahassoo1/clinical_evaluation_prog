DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Octavis. Nice to meet you too. Well, I've been having some trouble with my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my regular doctor thought I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. I understand. And when your regular doctor says "lately," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started maybe…three months ago? I had a reading at a pharmacy that was a little high, then it kept being high when I went back for refills. That's when my doctor got concerned and told me to schedule an appointment with someone. She said I needed a proper check-up to see what was going on.
DOCTOR: Three months, alright. And do you happen to know what those readings were, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I think it was around 140 over 90, maybe a little higher sometimes. But honestly, I don't remember the exact numbers. I just know she said it wasn’t good, and I get a bit flustered when I see those numbers, so I usually ask the pharmacist to write it down for me. I don’t always keep track of the papers though… Sorry!
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mykeisha. It's perfectly understandable to feel flustered. 140/90 is a good starting point. Now, have you noticed any symptoms along with the higher blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really, not that I’ve noticed anyway. I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but I always figured that was just from stress. And I get tired easily, but…well, who doesn't get tired? I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. Just…normal, I guess. Except for the high numbers, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, headaches attributed to stress, and generally feeling normal otherwise. That's helpful to know. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but that was just from dancing too much! The doctor said it was just wear and tear. Other than that… no. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, and get some exercise when I can. I've never been a sick person, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. Nothing like that. I’ve broken a bone or two when I was a kid, but those healed up fine on their own. No serious operations or anything. Just bumps and bruises, really. I try to be careful!
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—has anyone else in your family had issues with high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a good question. My grandmother on my mother's side had high blood pressure, I think. She was always going to the doctor for it. And my uncle, my mother's brother, had some heart trouble later in life, but I don’t know much about it. He lived in Barbados, so it was hard to keep up with everything. No one else that I can think of, though. My mom was healthy as a horse, and my dad...well, he passed away when I was young, so I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandmother with high blood pressure and an uncle with heart trouble. That’s useful information. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Just a pain reliever sometimes, for my knees, when they’re acting up. Something simple, like ibuprofen. And maybe a vitamin C tablet when I feel a cold coming on, but that’s about it. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can, to be honest. I prefer natural remedies when possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for your knees and occasional Vitamin C. That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I sometimes get itchy when I’m around certain flowers, but that’s just a seasonal thing, I think. Nothing serious, like an anaphylactic shock or anything. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, definitely not. I don't smoke. Never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine at a special occasion, but that's it. And I definitely don’t do any recreational drugs. I'm a pretty simple person, really. I like to dance, spend time with my friends, and eat good food. That's about it. I try to stay healthy and positive!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mykeisha. Thank you for being so open. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine with me. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully everything is okay!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure, just to confirm the readings your doctor was concerned about. Okay, that's 148 over 92. And your pulse is 76 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Everything seems normal so far, but the blood pressure reading is elevated. I also notice you appear to be slightly overweight, which can contribute to high blood pressure. Let's talk about some potential causes and what we can do about it.
PATIENT: Oh dear. 148 over 92? That doesn't sound good, does it? And…slightly overweight, you say? Well, I do enjoy my food, I won’t lie. I haven’t been exercising as much lately either, to be honest. Life just gets in the way sometimes. What do you think is causing it? And what can I do? I really don’t want to have to take pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Mykeisha, 148/92 is elevated. It’s good that you acknowledge the lifestyle factors, that’s a great first step. There are a lot of potential causes for high blood pressure, often it's a combination of things. It can be genetic – as we discussed your grandmother – but lifestyle plays a huge role. Being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and a diet high in salt and processed foods can all contribute. Stress can also be a factor. Sometimes there isn't a single clear cause and it develops gradually over time. Before we talk about a plan, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your high blood pressure, such as kidney problems or diabetes. They'll give us a more complete picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps figure things out, then absolutely. Blood tests and a urine test, no problem. When can I get those done? And will I need to fast beforehand? I always forget those sorts of things… I’m terrible with remembering details like that!
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood tests, so no food or drinks other than water. The urine test can be a first morning sample, so just bring that with you when you go to the lab. They'll give you instructions there as well, but it’s best to be prepared. I’ll write a lab order for you now. While we wait for those results, let's talk about some initial steps you can take. Reducing your salt intake is a big one. Try to avoid processed foods, fast food, and salty snacks. Increasing your physical activity is also important. Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a difference. And finally, managing your stress levels is key. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy that help you relax?
PATIENT: Okay, 12-hour fast, first morning urine sample, got it. I’ll make sure to remember that this time! No salty snacks… that’s going to be tough, I love my plantain chips! And walking… I do enjoy a good dance, does that count? It's definitely good exercise! As for relaxing… I like to listen to music, mostly calypso and soca. And I love spending time with my friends, chatting and laughing. It helps me forget about everything for a while. I haven't been doing much of that lately, though, work has been busy.
DOCTOR: Dancing definitely counts! That’s fantastic exercise and a great way to relieve stress. Excellent. And calypso and soca are excellent choices! Okay, so let’s aim for at least 30 minutes of dancing several times a week. We'll also work on reducing your salt intake – maybe try finding some healthier snack alternatives. And prioritize spending time with your friends, that's important for your well-being. Now, while we’re waiting for those lab results, it's also a good idea to start monitoring your blood pressure at home. A simple home blood pressure monitor can give us a better understanding of how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day. Would you be interested in purchasing one?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan, yes. I can definitely try to find some healthier snacks. And I will make more time for friends, absolutely. A home blood pressure monitor… hmm. I suppose that’s a good idea. I’ve never used one before, but if it helps, then yes, I'd be interested. How do they work? And are they expensive? I don’t want to spend a fortune on something I might not use properly.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear! They're fairly simple to use, Mykeisha. You just wrap the cuff around your upper arm and press a button. It will give you a reading of your systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as your pulse rate. Most pharmacies carry them, and they range in price from around $30 to $100, depending on the features. A basic model will be perfectly adequate for our purposes. I can write you a prescription for one, or you can purchase one over-the-counter. We’ll discuss how to use it properly when you come back for your follow-up appointment. I’ll also give you a log to record your readings, so we can track your progress. Now, I'm going to give you a handout with information about hypertension, including dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications. Take a look at it when you have a chance. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: Okay, $30 to $100, that’s not too bad. I think I can manage that. A prescription would be helpful, if you don’t mind. And a log to record the readings… that’s a good idea, I'd probably forget otherwise! A handout with information about hypertension… yes, please. I like to have things in writing. Hmm… let me think… No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Dr. Octavis. I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and not making me feel rushed. I feel a little bit better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help. It’s important to remember that managing your health is a team effort. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Here are the handouts and the prescription. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can discuss your lab results and review your blood pressure logs. And remember, if you experience any symptoms such as severe headaches, dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Mykeisha, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Dr. Octavis. I will definitely keep that in mind. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will schedule the follow-up appointment. Have a good day too!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
