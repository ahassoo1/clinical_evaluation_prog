DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes, welcome. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Osterholm! It's good to meet you. Well, it's just a regular check-up, really. My husband said I was due for some shots, and I figured I better get 'em done. You know, keep everything up to date.
DOCTOR: A check-up… right. Husband thinks you’re due for shots. And how have you been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Oh, pretty good, actually. No complaints, really. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't, right? Work's been busy – lots of new builds going up around here. But nothing I can’t handle. My joints ache a little after a long day on a site, but that's just getting old, I suppose!
DOCTOR: “Getting old,” you say. Well, aches and pains can be normal, but we should still check it out. Do you notice the aches in specific joints, or is it more all-over?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It's mostly in my knees and my lower back. Especially after I’ve been bending and crouching a lot, checking foundations and things. Not terrible, just… noticeable. And sometimes a little stiff in the mornings. But a hot shower usually fixes it up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Knees and lower back… alright. And how long have you been noticing this stiffness and ache?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a tough one. It comes and goes, you know? But I'd say, off and on, for maybe… six months or so? It’s been worse lately with all the rain we’ve had – makes everything feel colder, I think. It’s never stopped me from working, though!
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, not interfering with work. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no swelling, nothing like that. Just the aches. I sleep okay, eat pretty good, I think. I try to anyway! My husband’s a good cook. He worries about me, always making sure I'm not overdoing it. But I feel pretty solid, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any past medical issues?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. And I had the flu a couple times, like everyone does. Nothing serious, nothing that needed… you know, a lot of doctoring. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. I don't take any regular medicine, if that matters.
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. I’ve always been too scared, to be honest! I figure if it ain't broke, don't fix it! My grandma used to say that all the time. She lived to be 95, so maybe she was onto something.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mom had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but she lived a good long life too. And my dad, he had… high blood pressure, I think? He wasn’t one to go to the doctor much, either. And my brother, he's perfectly healthy, always has been. I don’t think there's anything… major… running in the family, if that makes sense. We're a pretty sturdy bunch, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion, but that's about it. And definitely no… other things! I’m a pretty straight-laced lady, I’m afraid. I spend most of my time working or with my husband and grandkids. No time for trouble!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Could you step up on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Here we go… Hope I haven’t been eating too many of my husband’s cookies! He makes a mean chocolate chip.
DOCTOR: 114 pounds. And your height is… 169 centimeters, according to the chart. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72. Respiration is normal. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Joints… Knees have full range of motion, but I do detect some mild tenderness with palpation. Back has some muscle tightness, but no acute pain. Okay. All right.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear about my heart and lungs! The knees and back… yeah, I figured you'd find something there. Like I said, it's just been a little achy lately. You think it's just old age catching up?
DOCTOR: It could be… age-related wear and tear, Ms. Fornes. Or muscle strain from your work. Without further testing, it's hard to say definitively. Considering your symptoms are mild and not interfering with your daily life, I recommend some conservative management for now.
PATIENT: Conservative management? What does that mean, exactly? Like… taking it easy? I can't exactly stop working, you know? Building season is too important.
DOCTOR: It means over-the-counter pain relievers if needed—ibuprofen or naproxen—ice or heat packs for the aches, and gentle stretching exercises. And try to avoid strenuous activity when possible. It's not about stopping work entirely, but being mindful of your limits. I'll write you a prescription for a multivitamin, just to make sure you're getting everything you need. And, given your lack of recent immunizations… we should get you updated on your tetanus booster and flu shot in the fall. Here’s the information.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Pain relievers, ice packs, stretching… I can do that. And a multivitamin, sure, can't hurt. Tetanus and flu shot in the fall… right, good idea. I always forget about those things. So, you don’t think it’s anything serious? Like arthritis or something? I’ve heard scary stories…
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, I understand your concerns, but based on the exam today, I don't see any clear signs of arthritis. The tenderness is mild, and there's no swelling or significant limitation of movement. However, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new ones—like fever, redness, or severe pain—you should absolutely come back. Considering your insurance status, I can refer you to the free clinic across town if you'd like to get some x-rays for peace of mind. It’s probably unnecessary at this point, but we can do it if it would make you feel better.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring to hear. No, no x-rays right now, I think. I’m probably just being a worrywart. My husband always says I overthink things. The free clinic referral might be good to have, just in case. So, just the pain relievers and stretching for now, and the flu shot in the fall? And you think I can keep on working? Building season is busy, and I don't want to let my crew down.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fornes. Pain relievers as needed, stretching, and keep an eye on your symptoms. And yes, you can continue working, but be mindful of your limits. We’ll get you scheduled for the flu shot in the fall. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Osterholm. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. I best get going, then. Lots of houses to inspect!
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Fornes. .
