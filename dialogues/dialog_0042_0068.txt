DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. It’s in my leg, mostly. It started after… after the cancer stuff. I had treatment, you see, and now… puffiness. It's not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, I understand. Swelling in the leg after cancer treatment. That’s certainly something we need to look into. When you say "cancer stuff," could you tell me a little more about what type of cancer you were treated for, and what your treatment involved?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it was… breast cancer. A few years ago now. They did… surgery, of course. And then… radiation. Lots of radiation. And… pills. So many pills! I don’t even remember all the names. It was at the big hospital downtown. Does that… does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Sasha. Breast cancer treatment with surgery, radiation, and medication. Thank you. And roughly when did you finish your treatment?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It finished… about two years ago, I think. Maybe a little more. Time… it goes so fast, doesn't it? It was winter, I remember that. Very cold winter.
DOCTOR: It does, Sasha, it certainly does. About two years ago. And this swelling… when did that start?
PATIENT: Hmm… not right away, no. It was… maybe six months ago? It started small, I didn’t think much of it. Just thought I was… sitting too long, or something. But it’s… gotten bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling started about six months ago and has gradually increased. Is it in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. My left leg. It feels… heavy sometimes. Not always, but… yeah, heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Just the left leg, and you’ve noticed some heaviness. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh… well, it's a little red sometimes. Not a bright red, just… a little. And… it feels warm to the touch, maybe? I’m not sure. My daughter noticed it first, actually. She said it looked different.
DOCTOR: That's good that your daughter noticed, Sasha. Redness and warmth are important things to note. Have you had any pain in your calf, or any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No pain, no. And no, no shortness of breath. Just… the puffiness. It’s mostly annoying, to be honest. Makes it hard to find shoes that fit!
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or shortness of breath, just the swelling and some annoyance with finding shoes. And to clarify, this swelling is only in your left leg, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Only the left leg. And it’s… it’s worse at the end of the day, I think. When I’ve been on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. That’s helpful to know. It's worse at the end of the day after being on your feet. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a closer look at your left leg. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s… worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Sasha. We'll do our best to figure this out. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, Sasha. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, when I feel your leg, it's warm to the touch, as you mentioned, and there’s some mild redness. I'm measuring a circumference of 38 centimeters at your ankle, and 36 centimeters at the same point on your right leg. There is no significant tenderness when I touch it. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. The doctors never said anything about that. I had… a lot of tests when I was having the cancer treatment, but they didn’t mention anything about clots. I really don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. No known history of blood clots. That's good. Now, let's talk about your medications. Can you tell me all the medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, and their dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Let me see… I take… Tamoxifen. Yes, that’s one. 20 milligrams, every day. And… a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. 2000 IU, I think. And sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take Ibuprofen. Just 200 milligrams, when I need it. That’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. Tamoxifen 20mg daily, Vitamin D 2000 IU, and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I eat anything, I take anything… well, except for that one time I tried oysters, but that’s a different story!
DOCTOR: Good to know, Sasha. No allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, and it was terrible. I always said I’d never touch one.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Sasha. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass. Red wine, usually. Nothing strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of red wine with dinner occasionally. And finally, can you tell me a little about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well… I try to walk. Not every day, but when the weather is nice. I used to be very active, but… after the cancer, it’s harder. I get tired easily. I do some gardening too, but nothing too strenuous. Mostly just weeding and watering.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. So, some walking and gardening when you’re able. Thank you for all that information. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it’s possible this swelling is related to lymphedema, a common side effect of breast cancer treatment. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot, which can be serious. To be certain, I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg to check for blood flow. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… Doppler what-now? Ultrasound? Oh dear. Is that… is that painful? And a blood clot… that sounds scary. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sasha. A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or anything like that. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your leg. It doesn’t hurt at all – it’s just a little cool gel on your skin and a probe moving back and forth. We need to rule out a blood clot because, yes, they can be serious. But, we're taking the necessary steps to find out what's going on. The ultrasound will give us a clear picture. Would you be comfortable with me ordering that test for you?
PATIENT: Oh… no needles, you say? That’s good. Cool gel… I can handle cool gel. And you think it’s probably just… this lymphedema thing? The one you said? Okay, yes. Yes, order the test. Let’s find out what’s going on. I just want to get back to my garden, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Sasha. I'm ordering the Doppler ultrasound now. The clinic will call you to schedule an appointment. It should be within the next few days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you elevate your left leg whenever possible, and wear compression stockings. These can help reduce swelling. I’ll write you a prescription for those as well. We'll get these results as quickly as we can. And if you experience any new pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or feel short of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… okay. I think my daughter has some, actually. She uses them for her… varicose veins, I think. I'll ask her. No, I don’t think so. Just… get this sorted out, please. I’m a bit worried, but… you seem very nice, Doctor. Thank you. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I understand your worry, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to get this sorted out. I'll make a note to follow up with you once the ultrasound results are available. Here’s the prescription for the compression stockings. And remember, if anything changes or you become concerned, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic or go to the emergency room. Thank you for coming in today, Sasha. And I hope you’re able to get back to your garden soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
