DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been…uncomfortable. Quite uncomfortable, at times. I have trouble remembering exactly when it started, to be honest. It comes and goes, you see. And I believe my…condition…makes things a bit more complicated. Lupus, I think they call it? It's been a while since I’ve discussed it with a doctor, so forgive me if I’m a bit vague.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph, no apologies necessary at all. Lupus can certainly affect things, and it’s perfectly understandable to be a bit vague after some time. We'll take it slow. So, this discomfort in your lower stomach…can you describe how it feels?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It's not…a constant pain, if that makes sense. It comes in waves. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, a sort of heavy feeling. Other times…well, other times it’s quite sharp, like a cramping. It feels…deep inside, you know? Not on the surface. And it can be…difficult to get comfortable. I find myself…shifting positions quite a lot. Is that…helpful information? I worry I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Glymph, you’re being very helpful. That’s a good description – waves of discomfort, dull ache sometimes, sharp cramping other times, deep inside. And the shifting positions…yes, that gives me a better picture. Does anything specifically seem to bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh dear…that’s a tricky one. I honestly can’t say for certain. I’ve noticed it sometimes happens after eating, but not always. And…I suppose when I’m stressed, it tends to be worse. Though, living is rather stressful these days, isn’t it? I try to…manage things, but it doesn’t always work. I don’t believe there’s anything specific I can point to. It just…happens. Does that…disappoint you? I always feel like I should have better answers.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. It's very common for these things to be difficult to pinpoint. Stress is a huge factor in many abdominal issues, so that certainly doesn't disappoint me – it's actually quite typical. We'll figure this out. Now, thinking about this discomfort…have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh, goodness. Let me see… Yes, I suppose I have. It’s been…irregular. Sometimes…difficult. Not always, but more often than I’d like. And…well, sometimes there’s…blood. Not a lot, but enough to notice. I’ve been…a bit worried about that, naturally. Is that…serious? I apologize for being so…hesitant. It’s not the most pleasant topic, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph, and you’re not hesitant at all. It's important to be honest and thorough, and these are sensitive questions. Blood in the stool is something we need to investigate, regardless of how much. I see you've been diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Do you mind if I ask when you were diagnosed, and what medications, if any, you're currently taking for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Lupus. It was… quite some time ago now. Perhaps… fifteen years? Maybe more. It’s hard to recall precisely. The doctor at the time, Dr. Eldridge, was very thorough. As for medications… let me think. I used to take… hydroxychloroquine, I believe. But I stopped taking it a few years back. I had some…side effects. And then…oh, there was a low-dose aspirin, I think. But I don’t take anything regularly now. Just… vitamins. And occasionally, something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Is that…sufficient information? I am truly trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Fifteen years ago with hydroxychloroquine and aspirin, and currently just vitamins and as-needed arthritis medication. Thank you. Now, regarding your arthritis, is that in your lower back, or elsewhere?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly in my…hands, really. And my wrists. Sometimes my knees, but mostly the hands. The lower back…occasionally, but not often. It doesn't feel the same as the stomach discomfort, though. The stomach…well, it’s a different kind of ache. A deeper ache. And…it radiates sometimes. Down my legs, a little. It’s… hard to explain. I do apologize. I feel like I’m just…describing symptoms, not explaining anything. Perhaps I should just let you examine me?
DOCTOR: You're describing things perfectly well, Ms. Glymph, and I appreciate your patience. The radiation down your legs is good to know. Yes, let's move to a physical examination. If you'll just lie down for me, please. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently palpate it – press on it – to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…reasonable. Perfectly reasonable. Please, do let me know if I need to…shift. I’m not very flexible these days. And…I apologize in advance if I flinch. It’s just…I tend to be sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. There’s some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. Not sharply painful, but definitely sensitive to the touch. I’m not feeling any masses or anything concerning. You’re right to be sensitive, it is tender. Now, I’m going to press a bit more firmly. Just let me know if that causes any significant pain when I release the pressure.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little uncomfortable. Not agonizing, but… noticeable. It feels…almost like a cramping sensation when you release it. A dull ache afterwards. Is that…expected? I apologize for being so… timid. I don't like being poked and prodded, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. No apologies needed at all. The tenderness and cramping sensation when I release the pressure are important findings. Okay, I'm also going to check your lower back, just to assess for any referred pain or muscle tenderness. Can you bend forward slightly, if that’s comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Oh…that's… not ideal. It’s a bit stiff. And…there’s a bit of a twinge in my lower back when I bend like that. Not sharp, but…uncomfortable. It feels different than the stomach, though. More of a…muscle ache, I suppose. I do apologize. I’m probably making this very difficult.
DOCTOR: You're not making it difficult at all, Ms. Glymph. These findings are very helpful. Lower back muscle tenderness is also significant, especially given the radiation you described earlier. Alright, based on your history and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your history of Lupus, we need to rule out a Lupus flare affecting your gastrointestinal tract. We also need to investigate the possibility of diverticulitis – inflammation or infection of small pouches in your colon – or even inflammatory bowel disease. The blood in your stool is particularly concerning, and requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…rather serious. Lupus flare… diverticulitis… inflammatory bowel disease… I… I don’t recall hearing about any of those before. Is there…anything we can do? I suppose I expected… something simpler. Is it going to involve…tests? I do try to avoid tests if possible. I always worry about the results, you see. And…what about the pain? It’s been rather distracting lately. Is there anything I can take for that, while we… investigate?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Glymph, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these possibilities. We'll take this one step at a time. Yes, further testing is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation. We’ll also need a stool sample – to look for blood, infection, and inflammation. And a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis will give us a detailed view of your colon and other organs. That will help us rule out diverticulitis or other structural abnormalities. For the pain, we can start with something mild. I can prescribe a medication called mesalamine. It's an anti-inflammatory medication that is often used for inflammatory bowel disease, and can sometimes help with pain even if that’s not the underlying cause. It's relatively gentle, but it does have potential side effects, so we’ll discuss those carefully. It’s important to note this won’t solve the problem, but may provide some relief while we await the test results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests…and medication… Yes, that sounds…reasonable, I suppose. A CT scan… I do hope it doesn’t involve… too much radiation. And mesalamine… side effects, you say? What kind of side effects? I do try to avoid anything that interferes with my… digestion. And… how long will it take to get the test results? I have a…garden, you see. I need to know when I can safely…return to it. It’s rather demanding. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Avoiding certain foods, perhaps? Or…anything to watch out for? I feel rather helpless, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel helpless, Ms. Glymph. We’ll work through this together. The CT scan does involve some radiation, but it’s a relatively low dose and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. Mesalamine can sometimes cause nausea, diarrhea, or abdominal cramping, but those side effects are usually mild and temporary. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. As for the tests, the CBC results should be available within 24-48 hours. The stool sample takes a little longer, about 3-5 business days. The CT scan results will take the longest, usually 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I recommend sticking to a bland diet – avoiding spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and dairy products. Try to stay well-hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity, including gardening, until we have the test results. However, if you experience severe abdominal pain, fever, chills, or bloody stools, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious condition. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Emergency room… severe pain… Yes, I understand. It sounds… rather alarming. A bland diet…no gardening… That will be… difficult. But I suppose it’s better to be safe. The stool sample… how exactly does one… obtain a stool sample? I apologize for being… indelicate. I haven’t had to… do that in a very long time. And…will there be…special instructions? I do want to make sure I do it correctly. And…is there anything else I should be telling you? Anything at all? I always worry I’m forgetting something important. Perhaps I should have brought a list… Oh dear. I feel so flustered.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask, Ms. Glymph. It’s a very common question. The lab will provide you with a collection kit – a small container and instructions. You’ll simply collect a small sample of stool – about the size of a walnut – and place it in the container. It’s important to avoid getting any urine in the sample. The instructions will explain everything in detail. And no, you’re not forgetting anything. You’ve been very thorough. It's completely understandable to feel flustered, especially with everything that's going on. Do you have any questions about the handout, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: A walnut-sized sample…no urine… Yes, I believe I understand. It sounds…manageable. But I do worry about…contamination. And…the smell. Oh dear. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very patient with me. And…thank you. For explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll just…go home and try to relax. And collect a sample. And avoid my garden. It sounds…rather daunting, but I trust your judgment. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, focus on getting some rest. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Ms. Glymph. .
