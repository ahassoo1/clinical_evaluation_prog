DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um... well, it's this tiredness. Just... always tired. It's been going on... a long time now, I think. Honestly, the days kind of blend together. I just feel worn out, all the time. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Always tired” can mean a lot of things, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. When you say a long time, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? It started… after my husband, I think. Everything feels a bit fuzzy around then, to be honest. It just… crept up on me, this feeling. Not like one day I woke up tired, it was gradual.
DOCTOR: I see. It's perfectly understandable that things feel a bit fuzzy, especially after a loss. Grief can manifest in many ways, and fatigue is a common one. But we should rule out other causes as well. So, six months to a year of gradual onset fatigue. Besides just feeling tired, are there any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… Sometimes my muscles ache a little. Not terrible, just… a dull ache. And… oh, I forget things easily now. Like, I’ll walk into a room and not remember why I went there. Is that a symptom? It's probably just getting old, though.
DOCTOR: It's good you're mentioning these things, Ms. Licano. Muscle aches and memory issues can certainly be relevant. The memory problems – are those new, or have they been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, they're definitely newer. I always had a good memory before. Now… now I have to write everything down. Lists, appointments… everything. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. It wasn't like this before my husband… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not embarrassing at all to acknowledge changes in your memory, and it's very helpful for me to know. Let's move on to some other quick questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat, I think. Maybe a little less than usual? And my weight… I haven't weighed myself in ages. I just… I wear the same clothes, and they still fit. So, probably not much change there either.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… That’s… a problem. I go to bed at a reasonable hour, but I wake up a lot during the night. I toss and turn… and then I just lie there. It's hard to get comfortable. And then I don't feel rested at all when I finally do get up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty staying asleep. Do you have any pain that keeps you awake, or is it more just restlessness?
PATIENT: Just restlessness, I think. Sometimes my legs feel a little… twitchy? Not always, but sometimes. It's not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Makes me want to move them, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, restless legs could be a factor. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. The doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, but he gave me a pill for it. I take it every day, I think. Aside from that… I don't know. Nothing else that I can think of. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re on medication for high blood pressure. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, I really don't. It's a little white pill. I get it filled every month at the pharmacy. I just… I don't pay attention to the names of things. My daughter usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look it up in your records. I see here you are on Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril… that sounds right. And… surgeries… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Years ago. Aside from that… I don't think so. Maybe I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, and a childhood broken arm. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. And… I live in the country, so I get pollen all the time. Never bothered me. I don't know of any allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother had heart problems, I think. She died when she was… oh, in her 70s, maybe? And my father… he had diabetes, I think. He died a long time ago. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don't remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. And finally, I'll ask about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked. And I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not very often. I don't really drink much. Just a little, very occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with, please. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not surprisingly given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs sound a little congested, and your heart sounds normal. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Reflexes are a little diminished, but nothing concerning.
PATIENT: Okay. Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say anything definitive, Ms. Licano. The exam didn’t reveal anything immediately alarming, but we have some findings that warrant further investigation. Your blood pressure is a bit high, and there’s some congestion in your lungs. The diminished reflexes are something we'll keep an eye on, but it could be normal for your age. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I think we need to rule out a few possibilities. Fatigue can be caused by many things, including anemia, thyroid problems, heart issues, and even depression. The congestion in your lungs could indicate a mild infection or something more serious. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. I also want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: More tests… Fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… please, try to find out what’s wrong quickly. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano, and I'll do my best. I'll write the orders for the lab work and the chest X-ray now. The lab can draw blood right here in the clinic, and the X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. They should be able to get everything done today. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… when will I get the results? And will someone call me? I don’t like going to appointments.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. The radiology report for the X-ray may take a little longer, maybe up to 72 hours. My office will call you with the results as soon as they're available. We can discuss them over the phone, or schedule another appointment if you prefer. We can even do a telehealth appointment to avoid a trip to the clinic if that works better for you. I’m also going to have the nurse give you a list of emergency warning signs to watch out for. It’s unlikely, but it’s always best to be prepared. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Telehealth would be good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just want this all over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I'm going to have the nurse come in and give you those warning signs and go over the instructions for the lab work. I believe that's all for today. Thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
