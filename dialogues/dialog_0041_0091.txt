DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, lately I does be feeling... very thirsty, you know? And hungry all the time. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I could eat more. It not making sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Thirsty and hungry a lot, even after eating… I see. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me see... I would say... maybe about a month or so now? It start slow, but it getting worse each week, you know? I does have to drink plenty water just to feel normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month. And is this thirst… a constant thirst, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It come in waves, you know? Sometimes I feel alright for a little bit, then suddenly I just have to drink something. And the hunger… same thing. Not all day, but it come on strong sometimes. It hard to explain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it's intermittent, both the thirst and the hunger. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I does be going to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. It does bother my sleep a little. And I feeling a bit tired, you know? But I does work hard, so maybe it just the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue. Alright. Do you have any family history of… diabetes, maybe?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother, she have it, yes. But she live long, you know? And I always thought I was lucky, not getting it. She have to take… what they call it? Pills, yes. Everyday. I never have to do that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – family history of diabetes. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Well, I does think I losing a little weight, yes. But I not sure. I does move around a lot with my work, you know? Hard to tell if it the work, or something else. Not a big change, but I feeling a little… lighter, if that make sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss. And just to be thorough, are you experiencing any blurry vision, or any sores that are healing slowly?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, Doctor. My vision alright. And sores? No, I does take care of myself. I don't get much sores. I keep clean, you know? I don't think so. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just one last quick question before we do a quick exam - what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications... Hmm. Not much, Doctor. Just the pills for my pressure, you know? The red ones. And sometimes I take something for the pain in my back, when it bad. But that not everyday. The doctor give me those too. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and occasional pain relievers. Thanks for telling me. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and we'll do a quick check of your reflexes. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs sound clear. Your abdomen feels soft, no tenderness. Now I’m just going to check your feet and ankles. Pulses are a little weak, and sensation seems slightly diminished in your feet. It's subtle, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Weak pulses… diminished sensation? What does that mean, Doctor? Is something wrong? I does walk a lot with my work, you know. I need my feet! Is it my shoes?
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, let’s not jump to conclusions. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it could be related to the symptoms you're describing. Weak pulses and diminished sensation can sometimes be seen in people with diabetes, especially if it’s not well-controlled. But we need to do some further testing to be sure. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, I'd like to order a blood sugar test, and a urine test. It'll help us rule things out, and see if we need to do any more extensive work-up. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood sugar test… urine test… Is it bad, Doctor? You think it the diabetes? My mother, she suffer with that. I not wanting that, you know? I just wanting to feel better. What if it is the diabetes? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, let’s take a deep breath. I understand your worry, and it’s completely natural to feel anxious when you're concerned about your health. I'm not saying you definitely have diabetes, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I understand. Not definitely. That good. It just… scary, you know? My mother… she have to prick her finger all the time. And the pills… I not wanting all that. So, what happen with the tests? How long we have to wait?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The tests will give us a clearer picture. We can do them right here in the clinic. It’ll just be a quick finger prick for the blood sugar, and a sample of your urine. It should only take about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. If the blood sugar is high, it doesn't automatically mean you have diabetes. We’d need to repeat the test on another day to confirm. If it is confirmed, there are very effective ways to manage it. It’s not necessarily about “pricking your finger all the time” anymore - there are many options for treatment, including lifestyle changes and medication, and we’ll discuss the best approach for you if that’s what’s needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sound better. Not automatically… lifestyle changes… That I can do. I like walking, you know? And I try to eat healthy. So, finger prick and urine sample then? Let's get it over with. The waiting is the worst part.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Finger prick and urine sample, and then we'll see what the results tell us. I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in to do those for you. She's very gentle, and will explain everything as she goes. I'll be right here if you need anything, and we can discuss the results as soon as they're available. Maria will be with you in just a moment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. You very kind. I just wanting to feel normal again.
