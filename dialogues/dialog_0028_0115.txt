DOCTOR: Right. Annelle Durig, 77. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s… my skin, you see. It’s gone quite yellow. Not a good color at all. I believe the young man at the lab said something about… the liver? It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I just want to feel better, dear. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Yellowing of the skin… that could indicate a liver issue, as the lab technician mentioned. It's called jaundice. Though, there are other possibilities. “A bit of a blur,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a blur. Everything is a blur these days, to be perfectly honest. I… I was told I have something with the liver, perhaps from being unwell some time ago? I don’t recall the specifics. It’s been… a long time. Do you need me to name a doctor who has treated me before? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A long time ago… that doesn’t help much, does it?
PATIENT: No, it doesn't, does it? I apologize. I wish I could be more assistance. I… I simply recall feeling quite poorly at some point, and now this yellowing. It’s concerning, naturally. Is it something serious, Doctor? I haven't been feeling myself lately, just… tired, mostly. And a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Uncomfortable" is vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… yes. Well, it’s… a dull ache, right here, under my ribs. On the right side. And sometimes… a little nausea. Not vomiting, thankfully, just… feeling like I might. It comes and goes, really. And my appetite isn’t what it once was. Everything tastes… flat, somehow. Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Right side abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite… We need to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: Oh my. Stool color… Well, now you’re asking a question. I… honestly, I haven't paid much attention. Is that bad? I suppose it’s been… paler than usual? But I’m not certain. It's difficult to recall, and I don't like talking about such things. Is it important, Doctor? Perhaps we could move on to something else?
DOCTOR: It is important. Changes in stool color can indicate problems with the liver and gallbladder. Let’s try this: has it been clay-colored?
PATIENT: Clay-colored… Oh, dear. I… I don't know what clay-colored looks like, exactly. Is that… very light? Perhaps a bit greyish? I think… yes, maybe a few times recently it has looked a little like that. But again, I’m not one to scrutinize these things. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is this something serious? I don’t have… family to help me, you see. It's just me.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to run some blood tests, more comprehensive than what was done previously. And I'd like to order an abdominal ultrasound. It will give us a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think. I… I don’t believe so. I've taken medication over the years, of course, but nothing ever… reacted badly. I'm not certain about contrast dye, though. I've never had an ultrasound before. Is it… unpleasant? I get nervous easily, you see. And I don’t have insurance, Doctor, so I’m worried about the cost. I just… I just don't know what I can afford.
DOCTOR: We’ll see what the insurance covers, though I doubt it will be much. The ultrasound is essential. As for allergies, we’ll proceed cautiously. We'll start with the blood tests. I’ll have the nurse draw those now. Don't worry too much. We'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: One step at a time… Yes, that sounds reasonable. But… is it likely to be something… grave, Doctor? I would appreciate a little more honesty, if you don't mind. I'm an old woman, and I'd rather know what I'm facing. And… about the cost. Could we discuss payment options? I have a small savings account, but it’s not very substantial. I wouldn’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Look, I can't make definitive pronouncements based on vague symptoms and a blurry history. The tests will tell us what's going on. As for the cost, speak to the billing department. I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly for the blood work.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I understand. I… I’ll speak to the billing department. And I’ll wait for the nurse. Thank you, Doctor. .
