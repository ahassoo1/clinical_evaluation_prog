DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Honestly, I don't quite recall why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not wanting things done to me? I just want my feet looked at. They’ve been bothering me something awful, but all this fuss… Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll get things sorted. Your daughter is likely concerned about your overall health, and it’s good she’s looking out for you. We can certainly take a look at your feet. But, I do need to ask a few questions, just to get a full picture. It’s standard procedure, you understand. So, regarding your feet… how long have they been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you exactly. A good while now. Probably since… well, since the weather got warm, I suppose. They ache, mostly. And they feel…swollen. Not terribly, but enough to make wearing my good sandals uncomfortable. I have a garden party next month, you know. And I must have proper footwear. It's important.
DOCTOR: Alright, so the aching and swelling seem to have started with the warmer weather. Is the swelling in both feet, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, dear. Both are a bit puffy. Not like balloons, mind you. Just…not as neat as they used to be. And they hurt when I try to stand for too long. I used to be able to stand all day, tending to my roses, but now… it's a struggle. Honestly, I just want some relief. I don't need a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Let's have a look at your feet. Could you please sit on the examination table and take off your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. It’s just…I don’t like being cold. My daughter always tells me I worry too much. But a lady has to have standards, you know. This table feels awfully chilly.
DOCTOR: You can use that blanket if you’d like. Now, let’s see… Hmm. I do see some swelling, as you mentioned, in both ankles and feet. Skin looks a little dry. And… are you noticing any changes in the color of your skin?
PATIENT: Color? Honestly, I haven't paid much attention. I suppose they look… normal. Maybe a little paler than usual, now that you mention it. But I haven't been getting out much lately, so that could be it. I used to have such lovely tanned skin, but…well, that was years ago. My husband, bless his soul, always said I looked radiant in the sun.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pulses are present, though a little weak. I'm also noting some slight discoloration around your ankles, a bit of redness. Have you had any injuries to your feet or ankles recently?
PATIENT: Injuries? Goodness, no. I’m very careful! I haven’t tripped or fallen or anything. I haven’t been doing much walking, though. Just around the house, mostly. I did prune my roses last week, but I wore my gardening boots. Very sensible, I assure you. Honestly, I just think they're getting old. Like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is some pitting edema present, meaning the swelling leaves a small dent when I press on it. And you mentioned redness... is it itchy?
PATIENT: Itchy? Now that you mention it… a little, yes. Just around the ankles, sometimes. Not terribly, mind you. I just put some lotion on it. It's probably just dry skin, like I said. Honestly, I don't make a fuss over little things. But it is annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it sounds like you’re experiencing some venous insufficiency, possibly with a touch of dermatitis. Your age and decreased activity level can contribute to this, along with the swelling being worse in warmer weather. The lotion helps with the dryness, but we need to address the underlying issue. I’d like to order some bloodwork to rule out anything else, and I'm going to recommend we try some compression stockings. Have you ever worn those before?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? Oh, goodness, no. That sounds dreadful. Like being squeezed! Honestly, I don't like feeling restricted. And bloodwork? Is something seriously wrong? My daughter always worries so much... Is it something catching? I don't do well with needles.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Gunasekara, it’s not “something catching.” The bloodwork is just to get a more complete picture of your overall health and rule out any other possible causes for the swelling. And compression stockings aren’t as bad as you think! They just help improve circulation in your legs, and we can start with a very mild compression. They're not meant to squeeze, just support. It’s important to understand that these are common issues with age and lifestyle. We’re not necessarily looking for a “cure,” but ways to manage the symptoms and keep you comfortable. Would you be willing to consider both the bloodwork and trying the stockings?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, it all sounds so…involved. I just want my feet to feel better! But…my daughter will be furious if I don’t at least try. She’s a very determined woman. Alright, fine. I'll do the bloodwork, if you insist. But I'm not promising anything about those stockings. They sound absolutely awful. Are they… fashionable? Because I simply must have proper footwear. And I won’t be caught dead in something unsightly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly find some stockings that are…discreet. They come in various colors and styles. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. It's just a standard test, and shouldn't take long. While she’s doing that, I’ll write out the orders for the bloodwork and a prescription for a mild compression stocking. We’ll see how you respond to these measures. If the swelling doesn’t improve, we may need to consider a referral to a vascular specialist. But let’s start with the basics first. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Ms. Gunasekara’s blood?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But I’m warning you, I faint easily. And I don’t like needles, not one bit. Honestly, all this fuss over a few aching feet! My husband would never have allowed this. He always said I was a delicate flower. And be gentle with the stockings, dear. I don’t want anything constricting.
DOCTOR: Of course, dear. The nurse will be very gentle. I’ll also make a note to have her take your blood pressure while she’s here, just to be on the safe side. And we'll find stockings that are comfortable for you. Just try to relax. We're just trying to help get you back on your feet, so you can enjoy your garden party. .
