DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Marija Chilla. I received a letter from the clinic suggesting I might want to discuss… planning for the future, as it were. Specifically, something about a form – an advance directive, I believe? My husband thought it prudent to inquire, though frankly, I find the whole thing a bit… morbid. But I am a practical woman, so here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It can feel a bit unsettling to think about these things, even though it’s a very responsible decision. An advance directive, or a living will, is essentially a document that outlines your wishes for your medical care should you ever become unable to speak for yourself. It’s about ensuring your voice is heard, even when you can’t express it. Your husband is very wise to encourage this. It’s a gift to him, and to yourself, to have that peace of mind. We don’t have to rush into anything, of course. We can simply discuss what’s important to you. Before we get to the advance directive itself, though, I like to get a general overview of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… sensible. Though I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. I maintain a very strict regimen, you see. But very well, proceed with your… overview. Though I trust this won’t take too long. I have several engagements this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I appreciate you being mindful of your time. This won’t be exhaustive, just a chance to get a better understanding of your overall well-being. First, let’s start with any current symptoms you might be experiencing – anything at all that’s been bothering you, even if it seems minor. And then, if you don't mind, I'll ask about your medical history, any past surgeries, and family health concerns. To begin, are you currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual changes in your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. As I said, I maintain excellent health. Perhaps a slight stiffness in my joints after gardening, but nothing that a warm bath and some liniment cannot resolve. Honestly, I find most modern ailments are simply the result of a lack of discipline. And proper posture, of course. My mother always insisted on impeccable posture. It’s… important. Are we required to delve into such trivialities?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Marija. And you’re right to point out that lifestyle factors play a significant role in health. Joint stiffness is worth noting – it's common as we age, and there are things we can do to manage it. Even if it’s mild, it's good to have a record. We’ll certainly tailor this conversation to your needs. Since you’re feeling well overall, perhaps we can move along quickly. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I have consistently maintained a healthy weight and a balanced diet. My blood pressure is… exemplary, I assure you. And my heart is perfectly sound. I lead a very active life, though admittedly, it is mostly gardening and overseeing the household staff. Are you suggesting I am… unwell? I find that rather presumptuous.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Marija. I apologize if my questions came across that way. I assure you, I am not suggesting you are unwell. I am simply following standard protocol to ensure I have a complete picture of your health history. It’s important to rule things out, even if you feel perfectly healthy. Since you’ve consistently maintained good health, that’s excellent news. Let's move on to past surgical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever undergone any surgeries or serious medical procedures?
PATIENT: No. I have never required surgery. I take excellent care of myself, as I have repeatedly stated. A minor extraction of a wisdom tooth in my youth, but that scarcely qualifies as a procedure. I suspect modern dentistry is far too… invasive. They seem eager to remove perfectly good teeth for the sake of… profit. Is this conversation progressing anywhere? I have a luncheon engagement at one o'clock.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Marija. And I appreciate your patience. We are progressing. Establishing that you haven't had any major surgeries is valuable information. Let's briefly discuss your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Well… my maternal grandmother succumbed to a rather aggressive form of… dementia, I believe it was. Though the medical care available at the time was… substandard, to put it mildly. My mother was remarkably resilient, thankfully. She lived to a respectable age, though she was always rather preoccupied with… appearances. A very superficial woman, honestly. My father’s side… they were largely unremarkable. A few cases of… indigestion, perhaps. Nothing of any real consequence. Are we nearing the end of this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Marija. Knowing about your grandmother's dementia is helpful. It’s good to be aware of family history, as there can sometimes be a genetic component to certain conditions. And no, this is certainly not an interrogation. I simply want to get a clear picture of your health to provide the best possible care. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No. I have no allergies. Absolutely none. I maintain a very strict diet, you see, and I am exceedingly careful about what I ingest. I do have a slight… aversion to poorly prepared cuisine, but that is hardly an allergy. It’s simply a matter of taste, Doctor. A rather refined palate, I assure you. Is this… ordeal almost finished? I find myself growing increasingly impatient.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Marija. Just a few more quick questions. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I do not. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A chamomile tea for sleep, perhaps. And a little honey for a sore throat. I find modern pharmaceuticals are largely… unnecessary and often detrimental to one’s health. They mask symptoms rather than address the root cause, Doctor. It’s… quite alarming, really. Are we finally approaching the subject of the… document? I must confess, I find this line of questioning rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. I apologize again for the seemingly tedious questions. As you mentioned, you're in excellent health and prefer natural remedies, which is wonderful. Knowing this helps me understand your preferences. Now, let's discuss the advance directive, or living will. Essentially, it’s a legal document that allows you to express your wishes regarding medical treatment should you ever become unable to communicate them yourself. It covers things like life-sustaining treatments, pain management, and end-of-life care. Would you be interested in learning more about it, and perhaps completing one today?
PATIENT: Well… that is what I came for, isn’t it? Though frankly, I still find the entire concept rather… morbid. My husband, bless his heart, is a very cautious man. He insisted. I suppose if it will alleviate his anxieties… yes, I will listen to your explanation. But I assure you, I have very strong opinions on the matter. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially under any circumstances. I believe in a dignified exit, and I expect my wishes to be respected. Proceed, Doctor. But please, be concise. I have a luncheon reservation, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I understand your concerns and respect your wishes. We will be concise. This document outlines several scenarios and allows you to indicate your preferences. For example, it asks what you would want if you were in a persistent vegetative state, or if you were terminally ill and unable to recover. It also allows you to appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. We can go through each section together, and you can simply tell me your preferences. There is no obligation to complete any section you are uncomfortable with. And you are free to change your mind at any time. Shall we begin with the section on appointing a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, let us get this over with. My husband, of course. He is perfectly capable of making rational decisions, unlike some people. Though he does tend to… overthink things. But yes, definitely my husband. His name is Omar Chilla. Is there anything else required? Forms to sign? Witnesses? I do hope this doesn’t involve a lengthy bureaucratic process. Honestly, the paperwork alone is enough to deter anyone from sensible planning.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Omar Chilla. We will need his contact information as well, which we can add later. Yes, there are a few formalities. The document requires two witnesses, who must be adults and not related to you or your healthcare proxy. We have witness forms available. And you will need to sign and date the document in the presence of the witnesses. It is a bit of paperwork, I agree, but it’s important to ensure the document is legally valid and your wishes are honored. Now, the next section concerns your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and resuscitation. Would you like me to explain each option, or would you prefer to simply indicate your preferences directly?
PATIENT: Explain them, please. I would rather not stumble through medical jargon. Though I assure you, my preferences are quite clear. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially. No ventilation, no feeding tubes, no resuscitation. A natural conclusion, Doctor. It's a simple request, really. Though I suspect modern medicine makes it unnecessarily complicated. Honestly, they seem to delight in prolonging suffering. Proceed. But be brief. My luncheon awaits.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I understand. Mechanical ventilation involves using a machine to help you breathe if you are unable to do so on your own. A feeding tube provides nutrition and hydration if you are unable to eat or drink. Resuscitation involves attempts to revive you if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. As you said, you do not wish to receive any of these interventions. We will document that clearly. This means that if you were ever in a situation where these treatments were necessary, healthcare professionals would not attempt to administer them. Here, we have a checkbox for "Do Not Resuscitate" – or DNR – which we will select. And here, we can indicate your wishes regarding ventilation and feeding tubes. Do you have any specific concerns about these treatments, or would you like me to explain any aspect of them in more detail?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further explanation is required. I have made my wishes perfectly clear. Select the checkboxes. Do Not Resuscitate. No ventilation. No feeding tubes. I find the very notion of being kept alive artificially… undignified. It’s an insult to the natural order, frankly. Is there anything else? I believe that covers the major points, doesn’t it? This luncheon is quite important, you know. Several influential people will be in attendance. I must not be delayed any further. Please, let us conclude this… ordeal.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that covers the major points. We've documented your wishes regarding a healthcare proxy, Do Not Resuscitate, and the refusal of mechanical ventilation and feeding tubes. Now, we just need the signatures of the two witnesses. Do you have two adults with you who are not related to you or your husband who can serve as witnesses?
PATIENT: Unfortunately, no. I came alone, specifically to expedite this process. My husband insisted I handle it myself. He finds… paperwork distressing. Are you telling me this cannot proceed without witnesses? Honestly, the bureaucratic hurdles are simply outrageous. I specifically arranged my schedule to complete this today. I suppose I shall have to return another day. It's… utterly preposterous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Marija. You are correct, unfortunately, the document does require two witnesses for it to be legally valid. It’s a requirement to ensure the authenticity of your wishes and prevent any potential challenges later on. However… We can offer a temporary solution. The clinic has designated staff members who are authorized to serve as witnesses in situations like these. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well… that is… acceptable, I suppose. As long as they are… reputable individuals. I do not wish to involve anyone who might compromise the integrity of the document. Though frankly, I still find the entire process rather… demeaning. But yes, proceed. Perhaps we can find someone… discreet. As long as it doesn't involve lengthy interviews or intrusive questioning. I trust you understand my… sensibilities.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I understand completely. We have several staff members who are authorized and discreet. I will personally select someone who meets your requirements. “Nurse Patel, could you please come in for a moment?
PATIENT: Very well. Let us get this over with, then. I have a luncheon engagement, you know. Several important people will be in attendance. I trust this won’t take much longer. And please, ensure the witness understands the importance of confidentiality. I do not wish to discuss my… end-of-life preferences with anyone who doesn't need to know. Honestly, the audacity of some people these days… It’s simply appalling.
DOCTOR: “Nurse Patel is fully aware of the confidential nature of this document, Marija. She will simply witness your signature and confirm your identity.” “Please, sign here, and here to acknowledge that you have read and understood the document. Nurse Patel will then sign as a witness. It will only take a moment.”
PATIENT: There. Is that… sufficient? Can we finally conclude this… ordeal? I trust I have fulfilled all the necessary requirements. Please, tell me it's over. I must not be late for my luncheon. Several influential people are expecting me. Honestly, the entire experience has been… rather unsettling. But at least it's finished, I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is perfectly sufficient. The document is now complete and legally valid. You have successfully appointed Omar Chilla as your healthcare proxy and clearly stated your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. We will keep a copy of this document in your medical record, and we will provide you with a copy to keep for your records. Congratulations, Marija. You’ve taken a very important step in planning for the future. And thank you for your patience. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll have the receptionist prepare your copy for you. And I wish you a very enjoyable luncheon. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. That will be all. I trust this document will not cause any… complications in the future. Though frankly, I have little faith in the competence of modern healthcare professionals. But at least it’s done. Good day, Doctor. And thank you… for your assistance. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have an engagement to attend. .
