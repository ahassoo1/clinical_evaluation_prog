DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Renzi. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, it’s my breathing. It gets difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I don’t like feeling… restricted.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing difficulties when lying flat… that's good you're getting it checked, Maribeth. It's always best to address these things. When you say "a little while," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, goodness. It started, I believe, sometime in… March, perhaps? Yes, March. Around the time the lilacs bloomed. Maybe a little after. It wasn’t constant then, just now and then. But it's been more frequent lately. I do recall that specifically, because my grandson, little Samuel, was visiting then. He loves the lilacs.
DOCTOR: Samuel and the lilacs… lovely. So, March, starting intermittently, and now more frequent. Do you find anything specifically triggers it, besides lying flat?
PATIENT: Well… not that I’ve noticed, no. It doesn't seem to matter what I’ve been doing. Eating, resting, even just sitting… it just seems to be worse when I’m horizontal. It’s… unsettling. And I do enjoy a good afternoon nap, you see. It’s quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive to your naps, that is a problem! Alright. And when it happens, what does it feel like, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s… a tightness, Doctor. In my chest. And I feel like I can't get a full breath. Like someone is… pressing on me. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable. And it makes me feel a little anxious, if I’m honest. It’s hard to explain. It's just… difficult to breathe.
DOCTOR: Tightness, difficulty getting a full breath, no pain but uncomfortable, and some anxiety… That's helpful, Maribeth, thank you. Now, let's talk a little bit more generally. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, asthma, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had a bout of bronchitis many years ago, back in… oh, 1982, I believe. But nothing… serious, as far as I know. The doctor gave me something for it, and it cleared right up. And my blood pressure runs a little high, but I take a small pill for that. Aside from that… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. My mother always said fresh air and a good diet were the key.
DOCTOR: Bronchitis in '82, high blood pressure managed with medication… good. And is that medication still working well for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly well. I have it delivered monthly, and I take it every morning with my breakfast. The pharmacist checks it every time, and my readings are always within a normal range. I haven’t had any issues with it, thankfully. It's a small pink pill. Very easy to remember.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Maribeth. Good consistency is very important. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single surgery. And no other hospital stays. I broke my wrist as a child, but that was just a simple cast. I was climbing a plum tree, you see. A very foolish endeavor, my mother said. But I was a very adventurous girl! Aside from that… no, nothing. I’ve been very fortunate. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises that come with a long life.
DOCTOR: Adventurous girls sometimes get bumps and bruises! That’s good to hear. Now, thinking about your family – are there any heart problems, lung issues, or breathing difficulties that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my father, he had a weak heart. He passed away when I was quite young, perhaps… ten years old. It was sudden, you see. The doctor said it was a congenital defect. And my aunt, on my mother's side, she had asthma as a child. But aside from that… no, not that I know of. It wasn’t something we discussed much, I’m afraid. Family history wasn't a common topic of conversation.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with a weak heart, aunt with childhood asthma… that's helpful. Now, just a few more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Goodness, no, Doctor! Never. My mother would have fainted. She always said smoking was a dreadful habit. And I’ve always been careful to avoid it. I do enjoy a glass of sherry with my dinner occasionally, but that’s all. A small glass, mind you. Very small.
DOCTOR: A small sherry, perfectly reasonable. And do you drink alcohol on any other occasions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just with my dinner, on occasion. Perhaps once or twice a week. Never more than a small glass. I’m a very moderate drinker, if I do say so myself. I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea, to be honest. Much more soothing.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea sounds lovely. Alright, Maribeth, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. I understand. Just… please be gentle. My ribs get a bit sensitive these days. And… do you mind telling me what you’re listening for, exactly? I always like to know what’s happening. It eases my mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. Absolutely. I'm listening for any unusual sounds in your heart and lungs – things like wheezing, crackling, or murmurs. It helps me understand what might be causing your breathing difficulties. I’ll be gentle, as you requested. Would you mind if I had you sit up first, and then lie back down so we can compare how your breathing sounds in both positions?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Yes, please. Sit up first, then lie down. Comparing sounds… yes, that makes perfect sense. I used to be quite good at puzzles, you know. I enjoy figuring things out. So, please don’t hesitate to explain anything. And… thank you for being so thorough. It’s very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take slow, deep breaths for me, please. In through the nose, and out through the mouth… Good. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly diminished breath sound on both sides, but nothing immediately concerning. Now, if you would be comfortable, please lean back and lie flat on the examination table. We’ll listen again and see if we can pinpoint anything more specific. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I go… Oh… yes. It is more difficult lying down. I feel… tighter.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. I am hearing some mild wheezing on both sides, particularly when you exhale, and the breath sounds are diminished when you are lying flat, as you noted. Your heart rate is regular, and I don’t hear any murmurs or extra sounds. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely alarming, but the wheezing and diminished breath sounds suggest some airway narrowing. To get a better understanding, I’d like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. It’s a small clip that goes on your fingertip. Then, I might want to do a simple chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or fluid buildup in your lungs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, please. A clip on my fingertip… and a chest X-ray… if that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you see. Pneumonia… that doesn't sound pleasant. And fluid… goodness. Yes, let's check everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the lower side of normal, but not critically low. It's good that it’s still above 90%. Now, I'll just excuse myself for a moment to arrange the chest X-ray. It's a quick procedure, and the technician will explain everything to you. It involves a very small amount of radiation, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. Just a few minutes, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. 92%… I suppose that’s not too bad. A quick X-ray… and a small amount of radiation… Yes, I understand. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust you. Don’t worry about me, I’m quite patient. You go ahead. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It really does ease my mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Maribeth. I appreciate your patience. I'll be right back, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as we have them. Don’t hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall remain perfectly still. And I will call out if needed.
