DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me a little crazy, honestly. It just feels…always irritated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Constant itching can be very distressing. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s all over, really. Arms, legs, back…not so much on my face, thankfully. And it doesn’t really look like anything is there, you know? No rash, no bumps…just…itchy. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? It’s been getting worse, slowly but surely. I've tried lotions, you know, the regular kind, but they don't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about a month, all over your body except your face, and there's no visible rash or bumps, just the sensation of itchiness. And lotions haven't been providing relief. That's helpful to know. To get a better understanding, could you describe the type of itch?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… It’s not like a mosquito bite itch, you know? It’s not quick and sharp. It's more… constant. A nagging itch. And sometimes it feels like it’s under my skin, almost. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. Like I need to scratch deep down to get relief, but scratching doesn’t even really do much, if that makes sense. Just…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant, nagging itch that feels deep, and scratching doesn't really resolve it… That helps me narrow things down. Now, have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t know if anything makes it better, honestly. It's pretty persistent. But I think…warm weather makes it worse. Definitely when I’ve been sweating a lot. And sometimes, after I shower, it feels extra itchy for a little while, even though the water feels good at first. Does that sound right? I haven’t really paid that much attention, to be honest. I just try to ignore it, which isn’t always easy!
DOCTOR: Okay, so warm weather and sweating seem to exacerbate it, and there's a temporary worsening after showering. We're building a good picture here. Now, let me ask about your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control for years now with…well, with diet mostly. And a little exercise, when I can. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think! I try to eat well. And I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, but that doesn't bother me anymore. Nothing else major, I don’t think. I’m divorced, if that matters…but that’s not a medical thing!
DOCTOR: No, your marital status doesn’t matter, Ms. Cassimatis. It's good to hear your blood pressure is well-managed, and that your gallbladder removal hasn't caused any ongoing issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you started any new ones recently?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything regularly. Just…sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, you know, the usual. But I haven’t taken any in…oh, maybe a couple of weeks now. And no, I haven’t started anything new recently. I try to avoid medication if I can. It always makes me feel a little funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen occasionally, but nothing regular. That's good to know. And you prefer to avoid medications when possible. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sneezing with pollen in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious enough to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky, allergy-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any of your family members – parents, siblings, or even close relatives – have skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or chronic hives?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tough one. My mother…she had sensitive skin, I remember that. Always complaining about dryness. But I don’t think she had anything…specific. No eczema or psoriasis, not that I know of. My father…he was a pretty hardy man, didn't really complain about much of anything. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest. They passed away when I was young. So, not much help there, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had sensitive skin, but no known history of eczema, psoriasis, or similar conditions in the family. That's alright. Now, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband…he smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. I always told him it was awful for his health! And I definitely didn’t want anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two or three times a week. Nothing heavy, definitely not every night. I enjoy a little bit, but I'm not a big drinker, if that makes sense. More for the taste, really.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Cassimatis. So, occasional wine consumption. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis, I’m not seeing any visible rash, bumps, or lesions. Your skin feels warm and dry, and there’s no significant tenderness to palpation. Your lungs are clear, and your pulse is regular. I'm noting the overall dryness of your skin. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, the persistent itchiness without any visible skin changes is interesting. Given your history, I’m considering a few possibilities, including dry skin – which is common, especially with age – and possible allergic reaction, although you haven’t identified a specific allergen. Another possibility, less likely but worth considering, is something called pruritus, which is an itch without a primary skin cause. It could be related to underlying medical conditions, though you don't report any. I'd like to order a few basic blood tests just to rule out some common causes. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get some relief, you know? Yes, please go ahead with those tests. Is there anything else I need to do? Or should I just make an appointment to come back when the results are ready?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll need a sample of your blood. They'll give you specific instructions, but generally, it's just a quick pinprick. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I recommend a few things to help manage the itch. First, avoid harsh soaps and detergents. Use lukewarm water when you shower, and pat your skin dry instead of rubbing it. And definitely moisturize frequently – multiple times a day – with a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion. I’m going to write you a prescription for a thicker emollient cream that can provide more sustained hydration. I also recommend wearing loose-fitting, cotton clothing to avoid irritating your skin. I want to see you back in about a week to discuss the blood test results. We can then determine the best course of action based on what we find. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. Those all seem like sensible things to try. I will definitely do those things. And I'll make an appointment for next week when I go to the lab. Thank you so much for your time and for listening to me. It's a relief just to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. It's always a good idea to get things checked out, and I hope we can figure this out for you quickly. The nurse will give you the lab order and schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I was wondering. I appreciate your kindness and patience, Doctor. Thank you again. I'll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
