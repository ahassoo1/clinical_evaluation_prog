DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it's... my chest. It hurts. Not all the time, but... sometimes it feels like a heavy weight is sitting on it, you know? Like someone is squeezing. It started maybe… three days ago? I think so. It's hard to remember exactly, but around then.
DOCTOR: Three days ago. Very well. And can you describe the location of this… “weight,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's… right here, in the middle of my chest. <points to the center of her chest> Not on the side, not my back, just… here. Sometimes it feels like it goes a little bit to my left arm, but mostly just here. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache, with pressure. Like someone is hugging me too tight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… adequately described. And does anything specifically bring this sensation on?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think... <frowns, tapping a finger to her chin> I think… when I walk up the hill to my daughter’s house. She lives on a bit of a slope, you see. And… sometimes after I’ve been gardening, bending over a lot. It’s worse when I try to do things, I guess. When I’m sitting still, it’s not so bad.
DOCTOR: So, exertion seems to be a factor. And how long does this discomfort typically last when it occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, not long, usually. Maybe five, ten minutes? It comes and goes. I rest, and it gets better. I haven't had it all day today, actually, but I was worried it would come back. I don't want it to be… something serious. My husband, he worries too, you know? He told me I should come right away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Chelberg. We’ll determine the cause. Now, have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had little aches and pains, you know, getting old. But this… this is different. It scares me a little, the way it feels. It's… heavy. Like I can't breathe properly when it happens. I’ve never felt this kind of pressure before.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor told me a few years back, my blood pressure was a little high. I take a little pill for it, every morning. White one, I think? I forget the name, but I take it. And… I had a little trouble with my cholesterol, they said, but I eat better now. More vegetables, less… sweet things. My daughter, she's a nurse, she helps me remember.
DOCTOR: And do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a tricky one. It's… a small pill, like I said. I get it from the pharmacy every month. It starts with an ‘A’, I think? Or maybe a ‘B’? I really can’t remember the full name. My husband picks it up, mostly. He knows all the names. It's a little white pill, that’s all I know for sure. I’m so sorry. I’m not good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: We’ll have to verify that with your pharmacy, then. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Doctor asked me that before, when he first gave me the blood pressure pill, and I told him no. I take other things sometimes, for my arthritis, but I’ve never had a reaction. Just a little stomach upset sometimes, but nothing serious. I’m usually pretty good with medicine, but I’ve never had allergies. Never.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. This will take only a few moments.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. <starts to slowly get up from the chair> That sounds good. Just tell me what to do. <walks towards the examination table, a little unsteady on her feet> I hope it’s not too much trouble. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Please lie supine, Ms. Chelberg. <listens to her heart with a stethoscope> I’m hearing a slight murmur, consistent with age. Lungs are clear bilaterally. <takes blood pressure> 148 over 82. Slightly elevated. <palpates chest gently> Any tenderness to palpation?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Not really. <winces slightly as he presses> Just a little… pressure. Like I told you, it’s not a sharp pain, just… heavy. Like someone is squeezing my chest. Is that bad, Doctor? The squeezing? It doesn’t hurt when you press, just feels… uncomfortable. Like when it happens when I walk up the hill. <looks up at him with a worried expression> Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: The pressure you describe is concerning, Ms. Chelberg, and warrants further investigation. Given your history of hypertension, age, and current symptoms, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity. We'll also order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. I will also order a full lipid panel and a complete blood count to assess your cholesterol and overall health. <pauses briefly> Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, tests… <frowns a little> Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don’t like tests, but… I want to know what’s wrong. If it will make me feel better, then yes. I consent. What do I have to do? Will they hurt? I don’t want anything… scary. <looks at him with a pleading expression> I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The EKG is a non-invasive procedure; small stickers will be placed on your chest and limbs to record your heart's activity. It's completely painless. The chest X-ray is also painless, though you will need to remain still for a few moments. A technician will explain the procedures in detail. <pauses briefly> I'll have the nurse draw the blood for the panel. We will review the results once they become available. In the meantime, I am prescribing a low-dose aspirin to be taken daily. <begins typing on the computer> It may help improve blood flow. <pauses briefly> We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in one week. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Aspirin? Oh, I think I've heard of that. Is that safe? I always get a little stomach upset with pills. <frowns, rubbing her stomach> And one week? That feels like a long time to wait. What if it gets worse before then? Should I go to the hospital if it does? I get worried so easily, you know. My daughter says I worry too much. <looks at him with a worried expression> Just tell me what to do if the pain comes back, Doctor. That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: The low-dose aspirin is generally well-tolerated, but you should take it with food to minimize any potential stomach upset. Should your chest pain worsen significantly – meaning it becomes more severe, lasts for an extended period, or is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or dizziness – you should proceed immediately to the nearest emergency room. Do not attempt to drive yourself; call 911 or have someone drive you. <pauses briefly> Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. More severe… lasts longer… shortness of breath… sweating… nausea… dizziness… go to the emergency room… call 911. <repeats the list slowly, nodding with each item> Emergency room. Not drive myself. Call 911. Okay. <takes a deep breath> That’s a lot to remember. But I will try. I will write it down. <looks at him with a slightly relieved expression> Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now, knowing what to do. What about the nurse? Where is she? I’m ready for the blood draw, I guess.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you momentarily. She will explain the blood draw procedure. <begins typing on the computer again, clearly indicating he is ending the consultation.> I will see you next week. Please schedule the appointment before you leave. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. <slowly gets up from the chair, a little unsteady on her feet> I will. <starts to walk towards the door, looking around for the nurse> I hope it doesn't take too long. <mumbles to herself> Emergency room… 911… Emergency room…
