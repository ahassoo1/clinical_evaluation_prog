DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not regular. It happens… not all the time. More when I rest, I think.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” is a rather vague description, Mr. Puder. More when you rest, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. When I sit down, or lie down to sleep. Not when I work. I work with… machines, big machines. Lots of lifting and moving. When I do that, I feel okay. It’s the quiet time when it… flips. It’s hard to explain. Like a fish… flapping? But inside.
DOCTOR: A “flapping fish,” right. Well, we need to be a bit more precise than that if we’re going to figure out what’s going on. How long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe six months? I think so. It started slow. Just a few times. Now… maybe once a week? Sometimes more if I am very tired. My wife, she says I look… pale when it happens. She worries. I don't like her to worry.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you’ve noticed paleness as well. Alright. Do you feel any other symptoms during these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I feel… a little short of breath. Not bad, just… like I need to take a big breath. And… a little dizzy, maybe? But not falling down dizzy. Just… light. Like the room is spinning a tiny bit. It goes away quick. And… no pain. No chest pain, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: No chest pain, good. Shortness of breath and dizziness… that narrows things down, marginally. Have you ever had this checked out before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't… go to the doctor much. I work, I come home. This… it just started. And I hoped it would go away. My wife, she said I must come. She says it sounds serious. I don’t like going to the hospital, you know? Too many… things happening.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your wife is probably right to be concerned. Ignoring these things rarely makes them disappear. Now, let’s go through some basics. Any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had… trouble breathing when he got old. I think. I didn’t know him very well. He lived in Yemen. My father… he was strong. Worked in the fields. No heart trouble that I know of. My mother… she lived a long life too. But… she had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother… alright. And you yourself, have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I am usually… healthy. I eat… normal food. Rice, meat, vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol. Sometimes tea with my wife. I don’t smoke. I work hard, that’s all. I never have time for… sickness.
DOCTOR: "Never have time for sickness"... A rather optimistic outlook, Mr. Puder. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I have taken… some pills for headaches before. Nothing bad. No rash, no trouble breathing. Just… normal headache pills. From the store. I don't remember the name. They are… small and white. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. I hope you find out what is wrong. My wife will be happy. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… a little fast, even at rest. Rhythm is irregular, as you described. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 135/85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is weak and irregular. No edema in your extremities. Alright, Mr. Puder. These findings are… concerning enough that I want to order some tests. An EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm, and a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes and rule out anything obvious.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? The EKG… is that… painful? And blood… I don’t like needles. Will it take long? I have to go back to work… soon.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless, Mr. Puder. It involves placing small stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. As for the blood work, it’s a standard procedure. A quick prick, and then it’s done. Yes, it involves a needle. But it's hardly noticeable for most people. We’ll need to draw about two vials. It will take about 15 minutes to do both. We have a lab technician available immediately. I'll have them come in. And yes, I understand you have to return to work, but this is important. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to something serious.
PATIENT: Okay. Fifteen minutes… I guess I can do that. But… not a long needle, yes? And… it won’t hurt much? I don’t like being stuck. My wife… she always does the blood tests for me, when I have to. I hate it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, I assure you it will be a standard needle. And yes, it will be a slight pinch. It’s unavoidable. It is necessary to collect the samples to determine what’s going on with your heart. I'll have the technician explain everything to you. Technician, please come to examination room three. We have a patient ready for an EKG and blood work. And please be… reassuring. We’ll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Try to relax. The technician will be here shortly.
PATIENT: Okay. I will try. But… my heart is already beating faster, just thinking about it. Maybe I should have just stayed home. My wife… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, the anxiety is not helping. Staying home won’t solve the problem, it will only delay a diagnosis. We are taking steps to find out what's going on. And frankly, dwelling on the discomfort will only make things worse. Now, try to take some deep breaths. The technician is just outside. We’ll get this done.
