DOCTOR: Hi Louine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one. Been having it for a while now, and it just won’t heal. Honestly, I’ve seen doctors before about it, but…they didn't seem to understand. It's probably because of the sugar, you know. The diabetes. But still. It hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been difficult to heal, and you suspect it's related to your diabetes. I understand that can be really frustrating, especially when you've seen other doctors and haven't gotten the answers you need. First, let’s get a good history of this. When did you first notice the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… oh, at least six months ago. Maybe more. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? It started small, just a little redness on the bottom of my foot. I thought it was just from my shoes, you know? I wear slippers mostly, now. But it didn’t get better. It just… grew. And now it’s quite… substantial. I really don’t like looking at it, to be honest. It's on my right foot, by the toes.
DOCTOR: Six months or more, starting as a small area of redness and gradually getting larger… on the right foot near the toes. Okay. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Well, walking, of course! Any amount of walking. Standing, even. Honestly, just being on it makes it worse. And sometimes, at night, it throbs. A real, bad throbbing. And I’ve noticed… well, sometimes there’s a smell. Not a good smell. I try to keep it clean, believe me. I really do. But it's hard. Everything takes so much effort these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so walking and standing worsen the pain, you experience throbbing at night, and you’ve noticed an odor. You’re doing your best to keep it clean, which is good. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore – any pus or fluid?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. There is some… leakage. It’s not a lot, thankfully. Mostly when I change the bandage. It’s… yellowish. And a little… thick. I use those little medicated pads, you know? The ones the last doctor gave me. They don’t seem to be doing much, though. Honestly, I'm starting to think doctors just hand those things out to get rid of us. They don't actually help. It stains the socks, too. It's very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, thick drainage, staining your socks... I understand your frustration with the medicated pads not providing relief. Let's talk about your diabetes for a moment. Do you check your blood sugar regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well… I try to. My daughter, Leilani, she reminds me. She’s very good about these things. But honestly, it's a hassle. Pricking my finger all the time… it’s not pleasant. Sometimes I skip a day. Or two. It depends. It's usually… high, I suppose. Leilani tells me when it’s too high. She has one of those machines. She worries about me, you see. A good girl, Leilani. But she doesn't understand how tiring everything is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you check when you can, with help from your daughter Leilani, and your blood sugar is usually high. That’s important information. Now, besides your daughter helping with blood sugar checks, do you have any other health conditions or take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My blood pressure, yes. It’s always a little high. The doctor gave me a pill for that. A little white one. I take it every morning. And my arthritis, of course. That's why my hands are so… gnarled. I take something for that, too. A pink one. Can’t remember the names of them, honestly. Too many pills these days. And I used to have a problem with my heart, but that’s been… quiet for a while now. That was years ago. A long, long time ago. Though I do get a little breathless sometimes, just walking to the mailbox.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure with a little white pill, arthritis with a pink pill, and you have a history of heart problems with occasional breathlessness. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. Though I shouldn’t, I suppose, with the sugar. But a little treat never hurt anyone, did it? And Leilani always makes sure I have my vitamins. She's very particular about those. No, no allergies. I’m a pretty sturdy old woman, you see. Always have been. Though this foot… this foot is something else. It’s just not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Louine, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much better picture of what’s going on. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your slipper and let me examine it?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. But don’t be alarmed. It’s not a pretty sight, you know. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it just keeps getting worse. Be gentle, please. It's quite tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay. I see the sore on the bottom of your right foot, near the toes. There’s some redness and swelling, and it looks like there’s some thickened skin around it – that's called a callus. It is tender to the touch, as you said. I also notice some drainage, and there’s a slight odor. Your pulses feel okay, and I can feel sensation in your toes, but it does seem a little diminished. I also notice some warmth around the area. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, this sore appears to be a diabetic foot ulcer. The diminished sensation and poor circulation associated with diabetes can make these wounds slow to heal and prone to infection. Given the size, drainage, and odor, we need to take this seriously. I want to get a culture of the drainage to determine if there's an infection present, and I'd like to get an X-ray to see if there's any underlying bone infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An infection? Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound good at all. X-ray? Well… alright, if you think it's necessary. I just want this fixed. I don't want to lose my foot, you know. I've heard stories. And the thought of an infection… What does the culture involve? Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have a doctor's appointment next week with Dr. Silva, and I wouldn't want this interfering. Honestly, all this… it's just so exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. It’s completely reasonable to be worried. We’ll do everything we can to get this taken care of. The culture is a simple swab of the wound to identify any bacteria present. It shouldn't be painful—it might feel a little bit of pressure, but it's quick. It will take a few days to get the results back, usually 2-3 business days. We’ll schedule the X-ray right here in the clinic, and it won't take long. We'll need to keep Dr. Silva informed, and hopefully, we can get these results back before your appointment with her. In the meantime, we need to protect the wound and prevent further infection. I’m going to have the nurse clean and dress the wound with a special dressing, and I’ll give you instructions on how to care for it at home. It’s very important to keep it clean and dry, and avoid putting any weight on it as much as possible. I’ll also give you a prescription for an oral antibiotic to start, just in case there is an infection present. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… well, alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. And keeping it clean… I can manage that. Leilani will help. She’s very good at these things. But avoiding putting weight on it? How am I supposed to do that? I need to get to the kitchen, you know. And the bathroom. I can’t just stay in bed all day. It's not practical. Perhaps a special shoe? Do you have those? Something with a soft sole? And… will this antibiotic interfere with my blood pressure medication? I always worry about side effects. Honestly, I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the antibiotic and your blood pressure medication. We'll check for any interactions before prescribing it, and I'll make sure you understand any potential side effects. Avoiding weight on it completely might not be realistic, and we don't want you stuck in bed. We can discuss options to minimize pressure. A special shoe is a great idea! We can get you fitted for a diabetic shoe with a soft sole and extra cushioning. The nurse will also show you how to use crutches or a walker if you need extra support. We’ll start with trying to minimize pressure as much as possible, and we’ll reassess as we go. I also want to order a vascular study to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. This will help us determine if there are any underlying circulation problems that are contributing to the slow healing. I know this is a lot, Louine, and I apologize for that. But we need to address all these factors to get this wound healed and prevent further complications. Let's start with getting the nurse to clean and dress the wound, getting you fitted for a special shoe, and ordering the vascular study. Does that sound like a good first step?
PATIENT: A vascular study… Honestly, it just keeps piling up. But… alright. If it will help, then yes. A special shoe sounds good. And getting the wound cleaned and dressed… that will be a relief, I suppose. I just hope this doesn't take too long. I have a luncheon with the ladies next month, and I would hate to miss it. It's the annual garden party, and I promised to bring my famous pineapple upside-down cake. Honestly, it's just so much effort to get everything done these days. Please tell the nurse to be gentle. My skin is very sensitive. And… is this Medicare-approved? I don't want any surprises with the bill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the luncheon and the cake—we’ll do everything we can to get you there! And yes, all of these procedures and the special shoe are Medicare-approved, as long as they are medically necessary. Our billing department will verify everything before you incur any costs, and they can answer any questions you have. I will make a note for the nurse to be extra gentle with your skin. I'll have the nurse come in now to clean and dress the wound. She’ll also give you detailed instructions on wound care and offloading . After that, we can schedule the vascular study and get you fitted for the special shoe. We’re a team in this, Louine. We’ll take it one step at a time, and we’ll get you back on your feet. Let’s get started with the wound care, and then we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time… yes. That sounds… manageable. Please tell the nurse I appreciate her patience. My feet are… not my best feature, you know. And I do tend to ramble. But I'm a good patient, really. I listen to instructions. Most of the time. Just… be gentle. That's all I ask. Now, let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: “Nurse Patel, could you please come in and assess Louine Cannington’s foot?
