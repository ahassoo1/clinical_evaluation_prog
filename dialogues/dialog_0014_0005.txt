DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Have a seat. Eighty-one, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. Eighty-one come next winter, but who’s countin’? It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? A strong name. Please, call me Lennie.
DOCTOR: Osterholm, yes. Deepa Osterholm. And you can call me Deepa, I suppose, though most patients just stick with Doctor. Now, Lennie, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Deepa, it’s about gettin’ settled. My niece, she’s been worryin’ about me livin’ alone. Good girl, that Sarah. She found a nice place, a senior livin’ facility. They want me to get a check-up first, make sure I’m fit enough to move in. Seems reasonable enough. I bake a lot, you see, and sometimes get a little… lost in the flour.
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up. Senior living facility. Of course. So, you’re mostly concerned about… being cleared for the move?
PATIENT: That’s it exactly. They want to know I can manage, you see. I can still bake a mean loaf of bread, and my hands haven’t lost their touch, but I want to be honest. I don't want to be a bother to anyone. Mostly, they want to know I’m…sound, I believe was the word Sarah used.
DOCTOR: "Sound." Well, we'll assess that. Let's start with a general history. Have you been feeling any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… not constant, no. My knees ache a bit when the weather turns, old war wound, though it wasn’t much of a war. Just some youthful foolishness. And sometimes my back gets stiff after I’ve been kneadin’ dough all day, but a hot bath usually takes care of that. Nothing that stops me from bakin’, mind you.
DOCTOR: Knees, back… alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I forget where I put my glasses, even though they’re usually on my head. And I get a little winded walkin’ up hills, but that’s been happenin’ for… well, a long time now. My niece says I repeat myself sometimes, but I think she just doesn’t listen close enough.
DOCTOR: Right. Forgetfulness, shortness of breath… and your niece thinks you repeat yourself. Okay. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite’s good as ever, Deepa. Always have been a hearty eater. Never could resist a good piece of pie, myself. And my weight… well, let’s just say I’m a solid man. Haven’t lost much weight, and thankfully haven’t gained much either. I try to keep regular, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medications?
PATIENT: Just one, ma’am. For my blood pressure. A little white pill. Been takin’ it for… oh, I don't rightly recall how long. Maybe ten years? Sarah fills the bottle for me, so I don’t have to worry about it. Keeps me regular, that pill does.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years. Never had a reaction to anythin’. And I haven’t been stung by a bee since I was a boy. Though I don't go lookin’ for trouble with the hives these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… When I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. Nothin’ serious, just a cast for a few weeks. And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But that was when I was still livin’ on the reservation. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky, I suppose. Never needed much doctorin’ in my life.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never had need for cuttin’. My mother always said a healthy life was the best medicine, and she was right. I’ve always been careful, never took unnecessary risks. I’ve lived a long life without needin' to be patched up, and I hope to keep it that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, a strong woman she was. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father passed when I was young, a heart ailment. And my sister, she had a bit of trouble with her joints in her later years, but she lived a good long life too. Mostly, we’ve been a healthy bunch, but we all got old eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother didn't allow it. And I haven't had a drink of alcohol in… well, not since my wedding, and that was a long time ago. Never had a taste for it. And I certainly don’t go near any of those other substances you mentioned. A man needs a clear head for bakin’, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that's the history. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please step on the scale for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Deepa. Happy to. Though I suspect I haven’t changed much since the last time I was weighed. A good, solid weight, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Eighty-three kilograms. And your height is on file as one point eight eight meters. Okay. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath...and exhale. Heart sounds regular, but a slight crackling in the lungs.
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, ma’am. Though I’m no doctor, of course. My niece, Sarah, she worries a lot about my lungs. Says I should get more fresh air. I do spend a fair amount of time in the kitchen with the oven on, though. Baking keeps a man busy, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. And finally, I’ll just take a look in your ears and throat. Ears clear, throat a little dry. Okay. That’s the exam.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t so bad. Thank you, ma’am. Do you have any thoughts on whether I’d be fit enough for the senior livin’ facility? Sarah’s been lookin’ forward to it, and I wouldn’t want to disappoint her.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tkac, you're eighty-one years old. Your blood pressure is elevated, your lungs sound a bit congested, and your reflexes are sluggish. You also admit to some forgetfulness and windedness. While you appear generally… functional, I'd recommend some further testing before moving into a facility. We need to rule out any underlying issues, like early-stage heart failure or cognitive decline. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. And I also think you should see a neurologist for a cognitive evaluation. Here are the orders for the lab work and the referral to the neurologist. Please schedule these appointments as soon as possible. We'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds like a fair bit of testin’. A lot of numbers and machines. Sarah will be disappointed, but I suppose it’s best to be sure. A neurologist… is that someone who looks at the brain? I don't mind a few tests, if it keeps my mind sharp for bakin’. I suppose not. Thank you, Deepa. I’ll get these scheduled right away. Is there anything else I should be doin’ in the meantime? Anythin’ I should be watchin’ for?
DOCTOR: Just… monitor any changes in your memory, coordination, or speech. If you experience any new symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden weakness – go to the emergency room immediately. And try to get some fresh air, as your niece suggested. Otherwise, just… keep your follow-up appointments and we'll see what the tests reveal. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think that covers it. You've given me a lot to think about. I appreciate your thoroughness, Deepa. It’s good to know someone’s lookin’ out for an old baker like me. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac. And please, schedule those appointments promptly. .
