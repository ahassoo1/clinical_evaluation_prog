DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It's my throat. It... hurts. Been hurting for a bit now, I suppose. I don’t really keep track of these things. Just…hurts when I swallow. I need to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be quick. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible. “A bit now”... can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know. A few days? Maybe longer. It’s not important. It just…is. I work with machines all day, very loud machines. Perhaps it’s from shouting over the noise? I don't see why I have to explain every little detail. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t take long if you can give me a few more details. Shouting over noise is a good thought – that could definitely irritate your throat. But we need to rule out other things. Besides the pain when you swallow, have you noticed any fever, cough, runny nose, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven’t taken my temperature. Do I look like I have a fever? And no, I haven’t been coughing. Just the throat. Really. I don’t…fuss over colds. Everyone gets sick sometimes. I’m a practical woman. I don't need a list of every possible ailment.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or cough. Have you noticed any changes in your voice – is it hoarse, or raspy?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… my husband used to say I sounded like a… a foghorn when I was upset. But he’s… gone now. I haven't really paid attention to my voice since. I suppose it might be a little rough, but I don't know if that's from the yelling or… something else. Honestly, it's probably just my normal voice. What is the point of all these questions?
DOCTOR: I’m just trying to get a complete picture of what’s going on, Tammie. It helps me figure out the best course of action. Okay, let's move on. Any difficulty breathing, or feeling short of breath?
PATIENT: Breathing? Of course not! I’m perfectly capable of breathing, thank you very much. I work with heavy machinery all day, I have to be able to breathe. It’s… common sense. I don’t understand why you’re asking such silly questions. Are you a real doctor? I really need to get back to work. This is costing me money, you know.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I am a real doctor. I understand your frustration and want to be as quick as possible. Let me just do a quick exam of your throat, and I’ll explain my thoughts. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And don't poke around too much. I have a very sensitive throat, as you can see. Honestly, I don’t know why I even came in here. It probably just needs a lozenge.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, open wide and say "Ahhh." Hmm. Your throat is definitely red and inflamed. I see some mild swelling, but no visible pus or white spots. Lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. Can you swallow?
PATIENT: Yes, I can swallow. As I told you. It hurts, though. It feels… scratchy. Like sandpaper. I don't need you to tell me it's red, I can feel it. Is this going to require… expensive treatments? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. It doesn't appear to be anything requiring expensive treatments at this point. It sounds like you likely have pharyngitis – inflammation of the throat, probably viral, given the symptoms and lack of pus. However, to be certain, I'd like to do a quick strep test, just to rule out a bacterial infection. It's a simple swab, and it only takes a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A swab? You're going to stick something in my throat? I don’t like the sound of that. What if it hurts? And what if it’s… inaccurate? I don’t want to be paying for unnecessary medications. Can't you just tell me what I should do? A lozenge and some tea, maybe? I’ve always been fine with a lozenge and some tea. I really don't see the point of all this… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick swab, Tammie, and it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. It’s the most reliable way to rule out strep, and it’s important to know for sure so we can treat you appropriately. If it is strep, you’ll need antibiotics. If it’s not, a lozenge and tea might be all you need. Would you prefer I consult with another doctor?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. But if it hurts, I’m leaving. And I want a written note explaining everything, just in case. I don’t trust doctors. Honestly. It’s probably nothing. A simple cold. But you have to do all this… poking. Very well. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, just open wide and say "Ahhh." This will just take a moment. Okay, all done. Now we just have to wait a few minutes for the results.
PATIENT: Hurry up. I have things to do. This is a waste of my time, honestly. And what if it's a false positive? I read online that those happen sometimes. I don't want to be taking medicine I don't need. It probably just needs a good gargle with salt water. My mother always said salt water cures everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, the results are back, and it’s negative for strep. That means it’s likely a viral pharyngitis. Unfortunately, antibiotics won’t help with a virus. The best thing you can do is rest, drink plenty of fluids, and treat the symptoms. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain, throat lozenges, and warm salt water gargles, as your mother suggested. I'll write you a note outlining these recommendations. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Salt water, you say? Well, at least you agreed with my mother. Fine. That’s… acceptable. As long as I don’t have to take any pills. Honestly, I knew it wasn't anything serious. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… let me go. I need to get back to work. I’ve wasted enough time here today. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Feel better, and don’t hesitate to come back if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week. Have a good day. .
