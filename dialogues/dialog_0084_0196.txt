DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, I just feel tired. All the time. Really tired. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Draining” is a good way to put it. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh… specific… Honestly? I couldn’t tell you. Months, probably. Maybe longer. After… after my husband passed, things got… blurry. It’s hard to remember what was before and what was after, you know? Everything just feels… slow. And heavy. Is that helpful? I wish I was better at this.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Licano. It's completely understandable that things are blurry after a loss. We'll take it slow. So, before your husband passed, would you say you had this same level of fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… No. No, I don’t think so. I was… busier, I think. He liked to keep me on my feet, always something to do. I used to garden a lot. And volunteer at the church. Now… now I mostly just sit. I don’t even have the energy to… well, never mind. It’s just different now. A lot different.
DOCTOR: Okay. So the fatigue seems to be a newer symptom, following your husband’s passing. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh dear. Let me think. I… I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible, just… dull. And I’ve been a bit… forgetful. Though, at my age, isn’t everyone? I can’t always remember what I had for breakfast, or why I walked into a room… things like that. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches and forgetfulness. Those are good things to mention. And it's good you're noticing them. Can you tell me a little more about these headaches?
PATIENT: Ugh… they’re just… there. Not sharp, you know? More like a pressure. Around my forehead, mostly. They come and go. I take some… some pills for them. Over the counter, I think. Acetaminophen? Ibuprofen? I can’t really remember which. My neighbor, Agnes, she told me to take something when they get bad. Honestly, Doctor, I just try to sleep them off.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure-like headaches that you manage with over-the-counter pain relievers. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any trouble sleeping despite the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's a good question. I wake up… a lot. In the middle of the night. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, sometimes I just… lie there. Thinking. Or… not thinking. Just staring at the ceiling. It’s awful. And then I’m more tired in the morning. It’s a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep, waking up during the night. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I used to have high blood pressure. Years ago. The doctor put me on some pills for that, and I took them for a long time. I think I stopped taking them… maybe five years ago? The doctor said it was okay, that my numbers were good. And… arthritis, in my hands. Nothing major, just a little stiffness. I take something for that too, I think. Everything’s a bit of a blur, honestly. Is Medicare okay covering all this? I worry about things like that.
DOCTOR: Medicare is okay, Ms. Licano, don’t you worry about that. We'll make sure everything is covered. And thank you for mentioning your blood pressure and arthritis. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I really don't. It was a little white pill, I think. That's all I remember. They made me feel a little… dizzy sometimes. That's why I stopped taking them, I think. My doctor at the time said it was okay to try stopping, as long as I kept an eye on my numbers. I used to check them at home, but… I haven't done that in ages. It’s all just… too much. It’s probably something simple. Honestly, Doctor, I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. You are not a bother at all. We’ll figure this out together. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh! Here. Let me see… I think this is everything. There’s… something for the arthritis, a little yellow pill. And… something for my stomach, because the arthritis pills bother it. And… oh, and a vitamin, I think. Agnes told me to take it. It's a multi-vitamin. Honestly, I barely know what I'm taking anymore. It all seems so complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let me just quickly review this… So, we have a medication for arthritis, one for your stomach, and a multi-vitamin. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history… That’s a tough one. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. But that was a long time ago. We didn’t talk about things like that much. It wasn’t really… done, you know? Is that helpful? I wish I could be more precise. Everything feels so… distant. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. That is helpful. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never! I wouldn't dream of it. My husband, he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never touched the stuff. And… well, I’m a church lady, Doctor. We don’t do things like that. I just want to feel better, that's all. It’s been so long since I felt like myself. Can we just… get this over with? I have a bingo night to get to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. We'll get through this quickly. And yes, bingo night is important! Alright, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be quick, please. And don’t mind if I close my eyes. It makes me nervous, all this poking and prodding. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathing normally, please. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Not drastically, but something we should keep an eye on. Ears look clear. Throat is a little dry, but no sign of infection. Your thyroid feels normal. And now, just a quick neurological exam… can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? It’s a bit… harder than it used to be, I think. Everything aches, you know? It’s just… old age. Can we be done soon? I really don’t like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of the dentist. And I hate the dentist.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. Grip strength is a little diminished on both sides, but not significantly. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, you’re experiencing fatigue, headaches, forgetfulness, disrupted sleep, and some diminished grip strength. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and headaches. I’m going to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D levels, blood count, and electrolytes. I’d also like to rule out any underlying infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work…? Oh dear. More poking and prodding? I really don’t like needles… But if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Do whatever you think is best. Just… tell me it won’t hurt too much. And how long will it take to get the results? I have bingo night on Wednesday, and I don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. The blood work is just a few small vials of blood, and it shouldn't hurt too much. It’s a quick pinch, and then it’s over. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process everything. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. And don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you increase your fluid intake, and try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. I also want you to start keeping a headache diary, noting the time, severity, and any potential triggers. And let’s try to reduce stress as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Headache diary… more things to remember… No, I don’t think so. It’s a lot to take in, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. I just want my energy back. Is there anything… anything I can take right now to help me sleep? Even just something over the counter? And thank you, Doctor. For listening, at least. It’s nice to talk to someone who understands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand. Feeling tired all the time is draining, to say the least. For the sleep, you can try taking an over-the-counter melatonin supplement, 3-5mg about 30 minutes before bedtime. It can help regulate your sleep cycle. However, it doesn’t work for everyone, and it’s important to use it short-term. If it doesn’t help, or if you experience any side effects, stop taking it. I strongly advise against using any prescription sleep aids without discussing them with me first. I’m going to have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once the lab results are back. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please call my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Melatonin… I’ll try that. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. And… tell your nurse I have bingo night on Wednesday. I don’t want to miss that. I hope you have a good day. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. We’ll do our best to get you feeling better, and we’ll certainly try to schedule your follow-up around your bingo night. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
