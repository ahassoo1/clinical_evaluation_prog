DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Well, it’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, a lot of… problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It’s probably nothing, but my ex-wife keeps telling me I need to get checked out, just to be safe. Frankly, I think she's overreacting, but… better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very wise of you to come in and address these concerns, even if you feel they might be overblown. Family history is important, and it’s always a good idea to be proactive about your health. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me a bit more about the “heart stuff” and “cancer” on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Well, my grandmother, on my mother's side… she died of a heart attack, I think. Pretty young, for a grandmother. Early sixties. And then my aunt… she had some kind of… I don’t know, breast cancer, I think? Had a mastectomy, chemo, the whole thing. Survived, thankfully, but… it was rough. My mother’s always been worried, always getting checkups. She’s fine, so far. I just… don't want to end up like them, you know? It feels… inevitable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern; it's natural to feel anxious when there's a family history of serious illness. Knowing the specific details can help us assess your risk. Do you happen to know the age at which your grandmother had her heart attack, and approximately when that occurred?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, I don't. It was… a while ago. I was pretty young. Maybe ten? Eleven? I just remember my mother crying a lot. And the funeral. As for my aunt… she was diagnosed… hmm. Probably in her late forties, maybe early fifties. It was around the time I started college, if that helps. I wasn't really paying attention to details then, I was… distracted. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just know there’s a lot of it on that side of the family. Is that helpful? Or do you need exact dates? Because I really don't have them.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Theriot. Approximate ages are still very useful. It sounds like there's a history of both early-onset heart disease and breast cancer on your mother's side. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your own medical history?
PATIENT: Right. Well, nothing major, thankfully. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, all that. No broken bones or anything. I get regular checkups, mostly just to appease my mother and now, my ex-wife. Blood pressure’s usually fine. Cholesterol’s… I think normal? I don’t really pay attention to the numbers. And I had the flu shot last year. That’s about it. I’ve never been a hospital person. Makes me anxious just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy. It's positive you keep up with preventative care. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything, even briefly?
PATIENT: No, never. Honestly, the closest I’ve come to a hospital stay was when I sprained my ankle playing badminton in college. They just wrapped it and sent me home. I’m pretty careful, I don’t really take risks. I mean, aside from getting divorced, which probably raised my blood pressure a bit, but that wasn’t a physical ailment. It was… stressful. But I’m fine now. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can certainly take a toll on your health, so it's good you're managing that. Now, let's talk about your family history a bit further. Aside from your mother's side, is there any significant medical history on your father’s side of the family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father's side… not really. He was an only child. His parents lived to be pretty old, both of them. He used to say they were just… tough. No major illnesses, as far as I know. He always kept things pretty close to the vest. He died a few years ago, of old age, basically. Just… wore out. He wasn’t one for doctors either, always said they just make things worse. So, I don’t have a lot of information on that side, either. It's mostly just… my mother's family that I need to worry about. Honestly, I’m starting to get a little anxious just talking about this. Is this going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Theriot. We can go at your pace. It sounds like the primary concern is your mother’s family history, and that’s where we’ll focus. To help me assess your risk, let’s quickly go through some lifestyle factors. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. My mother would kill me if I did. I’ve always thought it was disgusting. And bad for your health, obviously. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a beer on the weekends. Nothing excessive. I'm not a big drinker. Mostly water, really. I try to stay hydrated. Is that what you wanted to know? About bad habits? I don't really have any. I'm pretty boring, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. Do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Well, I teach engineering, so I'm on my feet a bit, walking around the lab. Does that count? I used to play badminton, like I said, but I haven’t had much time since the divorce. It’s… difficult to motivate myself. I walk my dog, usually about thirty minutes a day. It’s a small dog, a Shih Tzu, so it’s not exactly a vigorous workout. But it gets me outside. And I try to take the stairs instead of the elevator when I can. So, I guess I'm moderately active. It's not like I’m running marathons or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you maintain a reasonably active lifestyle. Finally, let’s discuss any allergies you may have to medications or anything else.
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I haven't had any reactions to any medications I’ve ever taken. Just the usual mild discomfort sometimes, like a stomach ache. But nothing serious. And no food allergies, either. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm pretty lucky in that regard. So, no, no allergies to report. Is that everything? Can we… stop talking about my family history now? It's starting to give me a headache.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the information I need for now regarding your medical history, allergies, and lifestyle. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you are generally a very healthy individual, despite the family history concerns. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. Just a routine check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But be quick, okay? I really don't like being poked and prodded. And could you explain what you’re doing as you go? I get anxious if I don’t know what’s happening. And please don't use those cold stethoscopes. Those are awful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I understand your anxiety, and I will explain everything as I go. I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. And I assure you, I always warm my stethoscope before using it. First, I'll check your blood pressure. I'm just wrapping this cuff around your arm. It will tighten briefly, and then release. It doesn’t hurt, but you might feel some pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Now I'll check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, which is also normal. Finally, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds are regular and clear. Your lungs are also clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds normal so far. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, you seem to be in good overall health. However, given your family history, I recommend a few baseline tests. Would you be comfortable with a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels and a complete blood count?
PATIENT: Okay. That…doesn’t sound too bad. But what does a "lipid panel" even mean? And what’s the point of a “complete blood count”? I want to know what we’re looking for. Don't just throw medical terms at me. Please. And how long will it take to get the results? I really don't want to have to come back here multiple times.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Theriot. I apologize if I used too much jargon. Let me explain. A lipid panel is a blood test that measures your cholesterol levels – things like your LDL cholesterol, which is sometimes called "bad" cholesterol, your HDL cholesterol, which is “good” cholesterol, and your triglycerides. High cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease, and since your grandmother had heart problems, it's good to get a baseline reading to see where you stand. A complete blood count, or CBC, checks the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help detect any underlying infections or other health problems. It's a fairly routine test, but it can give us a more complete picture of your overall health. These tests will just require a small sample of your blood. We can do them right here in the clinic today. It usually takes a few days – about three to five business days – to get the results back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan, if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Three to five days, that’s… manageable. And you’ll explain the results to me, in plain English? Not doctor-speak? Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Where do I go? Just… try to be gentle, okay? I bruise easily. And please, tell me what you’re doing before you do it. No surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. I will explain everything in plain English, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. I’ll also let you know exactly what I’m doing before I do it. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll need to access a vein in your arm to draw the blood sample. I’ll tie a small tourniquet around your upper arm to make the veins more visible. This might feel a little tight, but it won't be uncomfortable. Then, I’ll clean the area with an alcohol swab. You might feel a slight pinch when the needle goes in, but it should be quick. Once the sample is collected, I’ll remove the needle and apply a bandage to the area. It’s important to keep pressure on the bandage for a few minutes to prevent bruising. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ugh. As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Just… do it quickly. And tell me when you’re about to stick me. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Theriot. Here we go. I’m just going to insert the needle now. You’ll feel a small pinch. Alright, almost done. Okay, all done. Just hold pressure on this cotton ball for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. You’ll be fine. There you go. Just keep that bandage on for at least an hour. We’ll have those results back to you in three to five business days. If anything urgent comes up, we will contact you immediately. Otherwise, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them.
PATIENT: .
