DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my waterworks. Been botherin’ me again. Seems to happen quite a bit, if I’m honest. I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Just…often.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Waterworks” – you mean you’re having issues with urination?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Urination. That’s a fancy word for it, isn’t it? It…it burns when I go, sometimes. And I feel like I gotta go all the time, even when I just have. It's very…uncomfortable. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor? I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Burning with urination and frequent urges…that certainly points us in a direction. To help me understand better, can you tell me a little more about the burning?
PATIENT: Well… it's not always burning. More like a stinging, sometimes. And it’s…down there, of course. It doesn’t last long, usually, but it's enough to make me… jump. And it seems worse after… well, after I’ve been sittin’ for a while. Does that make sense? I apologize if I am not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Claudene. And don’t apologize at all, you're doing fine. Okay, burning after sitting for a while… that’s helpful. Now, is the burning accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…let me see. I… I think I get a bit tired, but I’m 66, so who doesn’t get tired? Sometimes my back aches a little too, but that could be from bendin’ over all day fixin’ them RVs. I don't know… is there anything else I should be lookin’ for? I don’t recall anything specific. It’s just…uncomfortable. Honestly, I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no chills, no nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No…no chills, I don't think. I haven’t felt sick to my stomach, not exactly. I did feel a bit weak last week, but I thought that was just the heat. It’s been awfully warm, you know. And no… nothing vomitin’ up. Just… this waterworks trouble. Is that… important? All of this?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Claudene. Okay. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any conditions like diabetes, or have you ever had kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. I don’t think so. Doctor Ramirez, he used to see me… but that was years ago. He did a lot of tests, but I don’t rightly remember what they were for. Kidney problems…no. Never been told about kidneys. I fix the machines, not…the body. Is that what you mean, Doctor? I apologize, I am terrible with remembering all this. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all, Claudene. We’ll take it slowly. No history of diabetes that you're aware of, and no kidney problems reported. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me see. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a girl. A long, long time ago. And… and I think I had a little something done on my knee, years ago. Just a little scope, the doctor said. Nothing big. But… that’s all I can remember, I think. Honestly, I have a terrible memory. I mostly remember the work, the RVs… not me. Am I being a bother, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Claudene. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay, appendix removed and a knee scope. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. My mother, she had…arthritis, I think. Her hands were always achin’. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, they said. But… that was a long time ago. And honestly, we weren’t very close. I mostly kept to myself, fixin’ things. I don't really know much about their medical troubles, if that makes sense? I really hope this isn’t too much trouble, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted and go home. It's been a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. Arthritis in your mother and high blood pressure in your brother. That's helpful. One last quick question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Absolutely not! Never touched a cigarette in my life, and I haven’t had a drop of alcohol since… well, since before I got divorced. That was a long time ago. I need a clear head for fixin’ those RVs, you see. Can’t be doin’ that with a head full of…well, you know. Is that all, Doctor? I really hope we can figure this out soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. Thank you for all that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a standard check, nothing to worry about. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Lie down…? Oh dear. Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. It's just… I’m not very flexible anymore, you see. And it's been a long day. Alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. Just… be gentle, please? And tell me if anything is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Claudene, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, let's start by just listening to your abdomen. Take a few deep breaths for me. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That’s… that’s a bit tender. Just a little bit, though. It's not… sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Especially when you press right… there. Is that… bad, Doctor? I'm very anxious, please tell me if everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when I press here on your right side?
PATIENT: Ooh! That’s… surprisingly more uncomfortable. It’s not horrible, but it's definitely…sore. Like a bruise, almost. Is that normal, Doctor? I’m getting very worried now. Please tell me what's happening. I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. Based on the tenderness, especially on your right side, and your symptoms, it's possible you have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, the tenderness on both sides and your age suggest we need to rule out other possibilities, such as diverticulitis. It’s important to get some tests to confirm. I'm going to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: A scan…? Oh dear. Well, I don't think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've always been pretty careful. But… a scan sounds serious. Is it going to hurt? And how long will it take? I have an RV to fix tomorrow, you see. Mr. Henderson is relying on me. And what if it is something serious? Is it… is it cancer? Please tell me everything, Doctor. I'd rather know, even if it’s bad. I'm terribly anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene, let’s take one step at a time. The CT scan is a painless imaging test. You’ll lie on a table and a machine will take pictures of your abdomen. It doesn’t involve any needles or injections. As for the possibility of cancer, it's far too early to say anything like that. Many things can cause tenderness and discomfort in the abdomen, and a UTI is the most likely cause right now. The scan is just to be absolutely sure and rule out anything more serious. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We will get the results back as quickly as possible, and I will explain everything to you in detail. I’m going to write you a referral order for the scan, and a requisition for the urinalysis. The lab and imaging center are just down the hall. Do you need help getting there?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I can manage. Just… down the hall, you say? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It’s… it’s just all a bit overwhelming, you know? I’ll go and… get those tests done. And… and I’ll try not to worry. You’ll call me if anything is… urgent, right? And you’ll explain everything to me? Even if it’s bad?
