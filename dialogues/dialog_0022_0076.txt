DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? Right here on my shins. They’re red and kinda sore. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them. Red bumps on your shins… and how long have they been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… let me think. Maybe… a month or so? It started with just one, and I didn’t think much of it. Then another popped up, and another… now there’s a few. They don't really itch, more just… ache, especially if I bump 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so, starting with one and gradually increasing. More of an ache than an itch, and they get worse with bumping. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them better or worse, besides bumping into things?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think anything makes them better, really. They just… are. I’ve been tryin’ to wear long pants more, so I don’t knock 'em as much, but that's about it. Maybe they feel a little worse after I’ve been on my feet all day at work, but I do a lot of walkin’ there. It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so long pants help avoid irritation, and they potentially feel a bit worse after being on your feet all day. Do you recall any injury to your legs around the time the first bump appeared?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I'm always gettin' little scrapes and bruises from work, but nothin’ major. Definitely didn't hit my shins hard enough to cause somethin' like this, I don't think. Work's mostly movin' boxes and stuff, not exactly a dangerous job.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific injury recalled. And you said you’re mostly moving boxes at work – is there any contact with, say, dust or any particular materials while you’re doing that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, sometimes. The boxes… they’re not always clean, you know? Some have kinda dirty tape on ‘em, and there’s dust in the warehouse. Old cardboard dust, mostly. Never thought much of it. Could be somethin’ to do with that?
DOCTOR: Possibly. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever or nothin’. And I haven’t felt sick, really. Just tired sometimes, but that’s just bein’ my age, I reckon. No cough, no aches anywhere else… just these bumps, really. And the little bit of soreness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or other aches. Just the bumps and localized soreness. Now, have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had my share of cuts and scrapes, like I said, but nothin’ like these red bumps. They just… appeared. My wife, she hasn’t seen anything like it on me before either. She's usually pretty good at noticing things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is a new experience for you. And your wife hasn’t seen anything similar before. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that’s it. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. No trouble with that, thankfully. And no food allergies… I eat pretty much everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you’re on medication for blood pressure – do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see… I think it’s… lisinopril? Yeah, that sounds right. Lisinopril. Small white pill. Take it every mornin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril. Good. And have you had any serious medical conditions in the past – like heart problems, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure, really. And maybe a little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age catchin’ up with me. The doctor says it’s nothin’ too serious, just gotta take it easy sometimes. No heart trouble, no diabetes… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure and some arthritis in your knees. Anything surgically done in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. I’m lucky that way. Just a few stitches here and there over the years from work accidents, but nothin’ major. Never needed to go under the knife.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, a little bit about your family. Do you have any family history of skin problems, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family’s not really the type to talk about medical things, you know? But… I don’t think so. My mother had some skin issues when she was older, but I don’t think it was eczema or psoriasis. Just… dry skin, mostly. And my father… he was pretty healthy too. Didn't really have any problems, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no strong family history of skin issues that you’re aware of. Now, just a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to, a long time ago, but she quit years ago. We’re both pretty careful about our health.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then. Maybe a beer with dinner on the weekends, or a glass of wine with my wife. Nothing too much. We don't really drink a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, light alcohol consumption. Now, one last question. Any recent travel or exposure to anything unusual, like new plants or animals?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. I haven’t left this town in years! Mostly just go to work and come home. We have a little garden, but just tomatoes and peppers, nothin’ fancy. No new pets, no travel… just stayin’ put.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Aluia. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to take a look at those bumps a little closer. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Hope you can figure out what’s goin’ on. They’re startin’ to bother me a little more each day.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see about six to eight small, red, slightly raised bumps on your shins, primarily on the anterior aspect. They’re approximately 0.5 to 1 centimeter in diameter. They appear to be mildly tender to the touch, but there's no significant warmth or drainage. There's no associated swelling or redness of the surrounding skin. Based on what you’ve told me, and from this initial examination, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing these bumps. However, given the history of gradual onset, the location, and the lack of systemic symptoms, a few possibilities come to mind. One consideration is stasis dermatitis, which can occur with mild venous insufficiency, and is made worse with prolonged standing. Another possibility is contact dermatitis, potentially from something at your workplace. And finally, we need to consider a form of vasculitis, though that's less likely given the lack of other symptoms. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with a complete blood count to check for inflammation?
PATIENT: Sounds… complicated, Doctor. All those words! But yeah, sure. Whatever tests you think are best. A blood test sounds fine. If it helps figure out what’s goin’ on, then I’m all for it. So, a complete… what did you call it? A complete blood count?
DOCTOR: Yes, a complete blood count. It’s a pretty simple blood test, just to check your overall blood cell counts and look for signs of inflammation. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, just to be thorough. I'm also going to recommend a lower extremity ultrasound to assess the veins in your legs and rule out any significant venous insufficiency. That's a non-invasive test where we use sound waves to create images of your veins. Does that all sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Sounds… a lot, Doctor. But alright. If it gets to the bottom of this, I guess I gotta do it. Ultrasound, blood tests… you said it won’t hurt? And it won’t take too long? I just wanna get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: No, neither test should hurt. The blood test is just a small needle prick, and the ultrasound is completely painless. It involves a gel being applied to your legs and a probe being moved around to create images on a screen. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes for both tests. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form, and the phlebotomist will take care of the blood draw. Then, you can go to the radiology department for the ultrasound. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and avoiding prolonged standing if you can. Over-the-counter compression stockings might also help to reduce swelling and discomfort. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… manageable. Elevate my legs, stockings… I can do that. And I'll go get the tests done. The lab's down the hall, you said? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look at this. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s goin’ on soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. Yes, the lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist there will be able to assist you. I’ll also give you a written summary of the instructions and the requisition forms. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. You explained everything pretty clearly. Thank you again for your help. I’ll go get these tests done now. I appreciate your time.
