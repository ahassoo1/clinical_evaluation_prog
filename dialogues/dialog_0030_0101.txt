DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Quicksey. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been having this headache, right at the back of my head. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it just won’t seem to go away. Not a terrible pain, mind you, just…there. Persistent, like a bothersome fly.
DOCTOR: I see. A persistent headache at the back of your head. Okay. And when you say “a little while now,” can you give me a sense of how long that is?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? Perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t constant at first, just came and went. But for the last week or so, it’s been pretty much there all the time. Not a pounding headache, like, more of a dull ache, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. A dull ache at the back of your head for the past week, consistently, after starting intermittently about three weeks ago. That helps. Now, would you describe it as being on one side or both sides of your head?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on both sides, Doctor. Hard to say exactly which side is worse, it feels… spread out. Like a band around the back, you know? Not right at the hairline, but further down, at the base of my skull. Does that make sense? I’m trying to be specific, but it’s just a headache!
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Popova. Thank you for being so descriptive. A band-like ache around the base of your skull. Has anything made it better or worse – certain activities, foods, positions, or times of day?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question. Let me think… lying down sometimes helps a little, but not much. And being stressed definitely makes it worse, I can tell you that. I do a bit of gardening, you see, and bending over for long periods doesn't help. But honestly, it seems to come and go on its own, regardless of what I’m doing. No particular food seems to trigger it, thankfully. I like my food too much to give anything up!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the food! It's helpful to know what doesn't trigger it. You mentioned gardening and bending over. Do you have any pain or stiffness in your neck or shoulders with the headache?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. My neck is a little stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. And my shoulders feel a bit tense. I just thought it was from the gardening, you know? I do a lot of reaching and pulling. But it’s true, the stiffness does seem to come with the headache. Not all the time, but often. I haven't said anything about it before because it's just… old age creeping up on me, I suppose!
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you brought that up. Neck stiffness and shoulder tension with the headache is important to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache – things like vision changes, nausea, fever, or any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that at all. My vision’s fine, no blurry spots or anything. No nausea or fever, thankfully. And no numbness or weakness. Just the headache and the stiff neck and shoulders, as I said. I feel perfectly normal otherwise, if you can believe it. Still able to do my gardening, still able to… well, still able to do everything I usually do, just with a bit of a nagging ache at the back of my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No fever, no vision changes, no nausea, no numbness or weakness. So, headache, neck stiffness and shoulder tension, otherwise feeling well. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a little pill, and that seemed to sort it out. I haven't had to go back for that in a while, so I guess it’s under control. Apart from that… nothing much, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? No arthritis or diabetes, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. You mentioned a little pill for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking me something. I take a few pills, you see, and I just leave it to my wife to keep track. She’s the organized one! I think… it was a white pill, small one? And it started with an “A”, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I can tell you exactly what I had for breakfast this morning, but ask me about a pill name, and it’s gone!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Popova. Many people have difficulty remembering medication names. We can look it up in our records if you’d like. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor, never had anything like that. And thankfully, I’ve never had to be hospitalized. Just a few trips to the doctor over the years for colds and flu, nothing serious. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have a history of headaches, migraines, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… my mother used to get terrible headaches, right through her life. Not migraines, as far as I know, just… bad headaches. She didn't go to the doctor much, though. My father was healthy as a horse, never a day sick in his life. And my sister… well, she’s still alive and kicking, and as far as I know, she doesn’t get headaches either. So, just my mother, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, just your mother with a history of headaches. And finally, let's briefly talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that for me. Never smoked a day in my life, and I don't drink. Not a fan of the stuff, honestly. And definitely no recreational drugs. I like a good cup of tea and a quiet evening with my wife, that’s about it. I'm a pretty simple man, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, Mr. Popova, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine with me. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148/92, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Okay, and I am assessing your cranial nerves now. Okay, that all seems normal. There is some tenderness when I palpate the muscles at the base of your skull. Do you feel any pain there?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s it! That’s where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, just… a soreness. Like a knot in the muscle, almost. It feels a bit better when you press on it, actually. Strange, isn’t it? But yes, that’s definitely the spot.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a bit strange, but not uncommon. The tenderness suggests some muscle tension there. Now, I'd like to check your neurological function with some simple tests, just to be sure everything is working properly. We’ll check your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything seems normal there as well, Mr. Popova. Your strength is good, your reflexes are normal, and your coordination is good. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by some muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on as well.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, you say? Hmm. That sounds… plausible. I do get stressed easily, you know. And gardening doesn’t help with that. As for the blood pressure, well, I’ll try to cut back on the salt, I suppose. So, what do you recommend I do, Doctor? Are there any pills you can give me?
DOCTOR: Okay. For the tension headaches, we can start with some conservative measures. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be helpful, as needed. I recommend trying those first. We can also explore some lifestyle modifications to help manage your stress. Things like regular exercise, relaxation techniques, and getting enough sleep. For your neck and shoulder tension, I can recommend some gentle stretching exercises. We can also consider a referral to a physical therapist if the tension is severe or doesn't improve with stretching. Regarding your blood pressure, I recommend monitoring it at home for a week or two. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Keep a log of your readings and bring it with you to your next appointment. If it consistently remains elevated, we can discuss medication options. I'm going to write you prescriptions for acetaminophen and provide you with a handout detailing some gentle stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders. I will also provide a log to track your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Stretching exercises, less stress, and keep an eye on the blood pressure. I can certainly try that. Acetaminophen… alright. I’ll take that as needed. A physical therapist, though… I don’t know. I’m not a fan of going to too many doctors. But alright, let’s try the stretching and the acetaminophen first. And I’ll keep track of the blood pressure, as you said. Yes… I do have one question, actually. Do you think the gardening is making it worse? I really enjoy my gardening, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Popova. The gardening could be contributing to your headaches, especially the bending and repetitive motions, which can strain your neck and shoulders. However, I don’t want to discourage you from doing something you enjoy. I recommend taking frequent breaks while gardening, using good posture, and avoiding prolonged bending. You can also consider using gardening tools with ergonomic handles to reduce strain on your hands and wrists. Listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. It’s about finding a balance between enjoying your hobbies and taking care of your health. We can reassess if the headaches continue despite these measures. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that answers everything. Frequent breaks, good posture… I can certainly try to remember that. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least for now. I’ll follow your instructions and see how it goes. I think that’s all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Remember to keep track of your blood pressure and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Here are those prescriptions and handouts. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month to see how you're doing. Does that sound alright?
