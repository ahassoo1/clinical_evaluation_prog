DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I keep getting…flushed. My face, you know? Gets very red. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not sure why.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’ve been experiencing flushing – redness of the face – for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about when this flushing happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be after exercise, no. And not usually after eating, either. Sometimes it just…happens. Like, I’m sitting and reading, and then, boom. Red face. Other times, maybe if I talk to people… a little bit. Not always, though. It's very strange. I don't know what causes it. It’s just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing. It sounds like it’s quite unpredictable, which makes it even more frustrating. When you say it happens when you talk to people, does it happen with everyone you talk to, or only in certain situations?
PATIENT: No, not everyone. Definitely not everyone. Like, if I’m talking to the cashier at the store, no problem. But… if it’s someone I don’t know very well, or… someone I want to make a good impression on… then it’s more likely to happen. Especially if they are looking right at me. It’s silly, I know. But it’s the truth.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Mr. Withycombe. It’s helpful information. This sounds a bit like what we call social anxiety manifesting physically. But we need to rule out other potential causes first. Could you describe what else happens when you flush?
PATIENT: Oh? Social… what did you call it? Okay. Well, besides the red face… sometimes I get a little warm, you know? Not a fever, just… warm. And my heart beats a little faster, maybe. But not really fast, just… noticeable. And… I don’t sweat, not usually. Just the red face and feeling warm. That’s it, I think. Sometimes I feel a bit… shaky inside, but you can’t see it. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so redness, warmth, a slightly faster heartbeat, and sometimes a feeling of shakiness internally. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing big. I had the flu a few times, of course. And my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago, but the doctor said it was just from stress. He told me to relax more. My wife… she took care of everything when she was alive. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I have to. She made all the appointments. I… I miss her. But that’s not what we’re talking about, is it? Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. It's understandable to feel that way. And it's helpful to know about the slightly elevated blood pressure in the past. We can certainly check that again today. Did you have any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. And I haven’t been in the hospital since… well, since my wife got sick. That was… a long time ago. Just the regular doctor visits, you know? Check-ups. And she always drove. I don’t drive myself. Never learned. It always scared me. She said I was a terrible navigator. She was probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And you don’t drive. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had… problems with her stomach, I think. She didn’t talk much about it. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember much detail. My wife’s side of the family… they were mostly healthy, I think. Nothing major that I recall. It’s hard to say, really. We weren’t very close to her family. They lived far away.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some possible history of stomach problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. We can certainly keep those in mind. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Nothing. Not even vitamins. My wife… she always said I was too stubborn to take pills. And… I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Food, or anything like that. I eat pretty much everything. Not spicy food, though. I don’t like spicy food. Makes me sweat. Which I don’t do much of, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or known allergies. That simplifies things. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and just take a look at your general appearance. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to help. I’m not very good with all the medical things, but I’ll try. My wife always told me to just listen to the doctor. She was a very smart woman. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. It won't be uncomfortable at all, I promise. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It's not drastically high, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your heart rate is 78, which is normal. I do notice some redness in your face, as we discussed. Your skin otherwise looks good. I'll just listen to your lungs, if that's alright. Your lungs sound clear. Everything seems normal on initial exam, other than the slightly elevated blood pressure and facial redness. Do you have any concerns about any of the above findings?
PATIENT: No… not really. I just get flushed, like we said. My wife… she always said I worry too much. She told me to just relax. I try, but it’s hard. The blood pressure… is that bad? I don't really understand all those numbers. And I don’t remember what she said about my lungs. Just sounds normal, right?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious, and it’s good you’re asking questions. The blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like, but it's not an emergency. It’s something we can monitor and manage with lifestyle changes, and potentially medication if needed. Your lungs sounded normal, which is good. Nothing to worry about there. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a combination of things. The flushing, with the emotional component you described, could be related to anxiety or a condition called rosacea, which causes facial redness. The elevated blood pressure could be a separate issue, or related to the stress and anxiety as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions and give us a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh. That sounds… serious. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I don't really like needles. My wife… she always held my hand when I got blood drawn. She was very good at that. But I suppose if you think it’s necessary… alright. But please, tell me what they’re for. And how much it will hurt.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about blood tests, and I understand your concerns. They aren't usually painful, just a quick pinch. We’ll take it slowly, and the nurse is very skilled. We'll be checking a complete blood count, to see if there are any abnormalities in your blood cells. We’ll also check your thyroid function, to rule out any thyroid issues. And we'll check your basic metabolic panel, which looks at your kidney function and electrolytes. It’s a standard set of tests to give us a broad overview of your health. The results will help us determine if further investigation is needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Um… yes, I think so. Thyroid… and kidneys… and what did you call it? Electrolytes? Sounds complicated. So, you’re just checking to see if everything is working okay? My wife… she always explained things so clearly. But I suppose if you think it’s necessary… alright. And it’s just a pinch, you said? Not a big poke?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You've got it. We're just checking to see if everything is working as it should. And yes, it's just a quick pinch, not a big poke. The nurse will use a small needle, and it's usually over very quickly. While we're waiting for the blood test results, I also recommend practicing some relaxation techniques. Things like deep breathing exercises or meditation can help manage your anxiety and potentially reduce the flushing. Would you be interested in learning some of those techniques?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques? Like… breathing? I suppose I could try. I’ve never really done anything like that before. My wife… she used to garden. She said that was relaxing. But I don’t have a garden. And I don't really know how to breathe properly, I guess. But alright. If you think it will help… teach me. What do I do? Just… breathe in and out?
DOCTOR: It’s simpler than you think. It’s about focusing on your breath to calm your mind and body. Here’s a simple exercise: Sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable doing so. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, filling your belly with air. Hold it for a few seconds, then slowly exhale through your mouth. As you breathe, focus on the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. If your mind wanders, gently redirect your attention back to your breath. We can do this together for a minute, if you’d like. Try taking a deep breath with me now. In… and out… slowly…
PATIENT: In… and out… slowly… It’s… harder than it looks. I keep thinking about all the things I have to do. And my wife… I miss her so much. But alright. In… and out… slowly… I'm trying. Is that right? Am I doing it wrong?
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Mr. Withycombe. It's completely normal for your mind to wander, especially at first. The goal isn't to clear your mind completely, but to gently redirect your attention back to your breath each time it wanders. Just keep focusing on the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. In… and out… slowly… You’re doing a great job. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It's… calmer, I think. A little bit. My heart isn't racing as much. It’s still hard to focus, though. All those thoughts… But alright. Better, I think. You said this could help with the flushing? Maybe if I do this a lot… it won't happen so often? And what about the tests? When will I get the results? And what happens then?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Withycombe. Even a small amount of relaxation can make a difference. And yes, with practice, this technique can definitely help manage your anxiety and potentially reduce the frequency of the flushing. The blood test results typically take 24-48 hours. The nurse will call you with the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Once we have the results, we'll have a better understanding of what's going on and can develop a plan to address it. That might include medication, lifestyle changes, or further investigation if needed. For now, let’s focus on practicing this relaxation technique a few times a day. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you being patient with me. And… thank you for letting me talk about my wife. It’s… hard sometimes. I’ll try the breathing exercises. And I’ll wait for the nurse to call. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Take care, and I'll see you soon. .
