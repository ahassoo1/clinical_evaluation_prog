DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, my muscles just feel weak. Like, really weak. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to make things difficult. I’m Edric, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Edric. And you’re very welcome. Weakness can be concerning, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "a bit now," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, properly, about three weeks ago, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. At first, I just thought I was tired, you know? Working long hours. But it hasn't gone away, and now… it's getting worse. It's mostly in my legs and arms.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, gradually worsening, primarily in your legs and arms. That’s helpful. And when you say “weak,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain. It's not like… a sudden inability to move. It’s more like… everything takes a lot more effort. Like, getting out of a chair is harder than it should be. Or holding something for a while. It tires me out quicker, and it feels like I don’t have the strength I used to. Even walking feels… heavier, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A feeling of increased effort and fatigue with normal activities. And is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, to be honest. It’s always there, a low-level feeling of… being weighed down. But it definitely gets worse with activity. Like, if I’ve been on my feet all day looking at cars – that's my job, I’m an insurance appraiser – by the end of the day, it’s really bad. And sometimes, in the mornings, it's a little bit better, but it never fully goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant with fluctuations based on activity, worse at the end of the day, slightly improved in the mornings. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I mean, I’ve been a bit more tired overall, but I figured that was from the weakness itself, you know? No pain, no numbness, no tingling, nothing like that. I haven’t lost weight, haven’t felt sick… just the weakness. It’s mostly just… frustrating. I like to stay busy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's good you haven't experienced any other concerning symptoms like pain or numbness. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the flu a couple of times, broke my arm when I was a kid – that's about it. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. Just the usual childhood stuff, I guess. I'm usually pretty healthy, to be honest. This weakness is… new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My dad had some heart trouble when he was older, but he lived to be eighty-five, so… I don’t know. My mom was pretty healthy too. No real history of… muscle problems or anything like that that I know of. We didn’t really talk about health much. It wasn’t… a thing in my family, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s helpful to know even if there isn’t a strong family history. Now, I’ll ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. And definitely no drugs. I don’t really… indulge in any of that. I try to stay on the straight and narrow, you know? I eat pretty normally, I guess. Not a health nut, but I try not to eat too much junk food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Nothing at all. I can take pretty much any medication without any problems. I haven't had any reactions, ever. Honestly, I'm a pretty boring medical case. Just this weakness. It’s just… really annoying and I'd like to know what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Edric. It gives me a much clearer picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's going on. So, strength, reflexes… okay. Let's get to it. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric, I'm going to have you sit on the edge of the table and just let your legs dangle. Please don't tense them. Now, can you gently push your legs away from me?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that. It feels a bit… strained, honestly. I mean, I'm pushing, but it doesn't feel like I'm putting much effort into it, if that makes sense? Is that normal? I don't exercise much, so I'm probably just weak overall, right?
DOCTOR: I notice some slight asymmetry in your strength, Edric. Your left leg appears a little weaker than your right. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Please just relax your legs. I’m going to tap just below your kneecap with this little hammer. It’s nothing painful.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that's fine. Feels like a normal tap. Is something wrong? Is my knee not moving properly? I don’t do a lot of… sports or anything. I mostly just walk.
DOCTOR: The reflex on your left side is a little bit weaker than your right as well. I also tested the sensory function in your legs and arms, and that seems normal. Overall, the exam findings suggest some weakness on the left side, specifically in your leg. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'm concerned about a potential nerve issue or something affecting the muscles themselves. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a few tests to check for muscle enzymes. We may also need to consider an MRI of your spine or legs depending on the results of the blood tests. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests, okay. I can do that. But an MRI? Is it… is it something bad? I mean, I don’t feel any pain, just weakness. It couldn't just be… a vitamin deficiency or something? I eat okay, I think. Look, I don't want to overreact, but I have to work. I’m an insurance appraiser, and I need to be able to walk around and look at cars. An MRI sounds… expensive and scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Edric. An MRI isn’t necessarily indicative of something serious, but it helps us rule out any potential structural issues that could be causing your weakness. It's a detailed imaging study, and we can learn a lot from it. And yes, a vitamin deficiency is a possibility, which is why the blood tests are important. We'll check your vitamin levels, as well as other things. The blood tests are a good first step, and we can discuss the MRI further after we have the results. We can also explore other possibilities, like physical therapy, if the tests are normal. The cost of the MRI depends on your insurance coverage, but we do have financial assistance programs available if needed. I can have our billing department contact you to discuss the costs and options. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests done. I'll write you a lab requisition, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the process?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… where do I go? And how long does it take? I need to get back to work as soon as I can. And I don’t have insurance, so… I guess I’ll have to pay out of pocket? It's just… this is all a bit stressful, you know? Look, just tell me where to go for the blood tests, and I'll try to get it done as soon as possible. And please, if it's not serious, let me know. I'm a single guy, and I can’t really afford a lot of medical bills.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Edric. It’s stressful enough dealing with weakness, let alone worrying about medical bills. Let me assure you, we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and create a manageable plan. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. You can walk in anytime Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes for the blood draw and processing. Since you don’t have insurance, the lab will likely require payment at the time of service. I'll provide you with a printed estimate of the costs, and we can also explore options for financial assistance or payment plans. Our billing department can help with that. I’ll have them contact you directly after your appointment to discuss the costs and available options. Here’s the lab requisition and the estimate of the costs. Do you have any questions about these documents?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just... 123 Main Street. Okay. And they'll contact me about the bills. Right. Well, thanks, Doctor. I guess I'll go get the blood tests done. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I really appreciate your help. And if you think of anything else… please let me know. I'd rather be prepared. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you that we'll work through this together. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. I’ll have our billing department reach out to you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results are available. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
