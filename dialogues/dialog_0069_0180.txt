DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's… it's hard to explain. I just… I’m tired. Really tired. And I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I get this feeling and then I just… have to. It's embarrassing. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, and it's okay to feel embarrassed, but I appreciate you being open with me. We'll figure this out together. When you say “tired,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More? What is there to say? I'm just... drained. Like a battery. All the time. Doesn't matter if I sleep ten hours, doesn't matter if I don't. I just… have no energy. It’s been going on… a while now. Months, I guess. Maybe longer. Honestly, I don’t really keep track anymore. It’s all just… blurry. And the dirt… it happens when I feel most tired, usually. It's not like I'm going out of my way to find the best soil or anything! It just… feels right. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Hedy. Thank you for explaining. It sounds incredibly difficult to live with this constant fatigue. And the urge to eat dirt… that’s unusual. To help me understand what might be going on, can you tell me if you've noticed anything else happening alongside the tiredness and this urge?
PATIENT: Ugh, else? Like what? I don't know. I get headaches sometimes, I guess. And… my stomach kinda hurts. Not all the time, just… on and off. I’ve lost weight, probably. My clothes feel a little loose. Honestly, I haven’t been paying much attention. Life just feels… heavy. Is that a symptom? I just want to go back to feeling normal. Look, I used to be able to… to do things. Now? Forget about it. It's all just… a struggle. And please, don’t ask me about my diet. I eat whatever's easiest.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a lot is going on, and it’s completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed. The headaches and stomach pain are important to note, and weight loss can definitely be a sign something is going on. “Heavy” is a symptom, Hedy – it describes how you feel, and that's very valuable information. Okay, let’s try to gather a bit more information. Have you noticed anything specific that makes the fatigue worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Everything makes it worse! Getting out of bed, trying to cook, even just… thinking. I used to work, you know? CNC programming. Required a lot of focus. Now… I can barely concentrate for five minutes. The dirt craving seems to happen when I’m really stressed, or really, really tired. Like after a long day of… of just trying to get through the day. Does that make sense? Look, I’m not a doctor. I just know I feel awful. And I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. It sounds incredibly debilitating, Hedy. The fact that it’s worsened by stress and is linked to the craving is helpful. Let’s move on to some other things, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Ugh, past medical… Honestly? Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox. Nothing serious. My husband… he had diabetes, but that’s not me. I haven't been to a doctor in… years. I try to avoid them. Always a waste of time. Just tell me what's wrong and how to fix it, okay? I don't have time for a lot of… questions. And please, don’t tell me to eat more vegetables. I already told you, I eat whatever’s easiest. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m taking up your time. I want to assure you I'm not trying to make this difficult. We need to gather enough information to understand what might be going on, and that includes asking some questions about your history. Okay. No serious illnesses, and you haven't been to a doctor in years. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
