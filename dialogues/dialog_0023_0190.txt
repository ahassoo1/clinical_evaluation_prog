DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been difficult to stay on my feet, lately. I feel quite unsteady. It’s hard to explain, precisely when it started… things have been a bit… hazy, if you understand.
DOCTOR: "Hazy," alright. Can you elaborate on that, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Elaborate…? Yes, of course. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I find myself forgetting things, dates mostly. And… well, it's hard to pinpoint when the unsteadiness began because of that. It feels like it’s been… a while. Perhaps a few months? But I couldn’t say for certain. It’s… frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: A few months of memory issues and unsteadiness. Dates specifically. Alright. Have you experienced any head trauma recently?
PATIENT: Head trauma…? No, not that I recall. I work with a… a rotary drill, for oil and gas. It’s a bit of a rough job, but we have safety protocols. I believe I would remember a head injury, if one had occurred. Though… as I said, my recollection isn’t reliable. Is that a concern? Should it be?
DOCTOR: It is a concern, Ms. Snerling. A history of even minor head trauma, especially with associated memory issues, needs to be investigated. Rotary drills… that’s not a particularly forgiving environment. Let's start with a thorough neurological exam, and I’ll want to review your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: A neurological exam sounds… sensible. I suppose. As for medical conditions… let me think. I was… married, you see. My husband handled most of the paperwork. I believe I have… fairly standard insurance, private. And… oh. He said I had… slightly high blood pressure, at one point. But that was some time ago. I'm not currently taking any medication, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Slightly high blood pressure… and no current medications. Alright. Any family history of neurological issues – dementia, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult question. My family is… in Ethiopia, mostly. We haven’t been in close contact for many years. I… vaguely recall my grandmother being unwell in her later years. Something with her mind, perhaps? But it was a long time ago, and the details are very… unclear. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s truly frustrating not to have these answers. I do know my husband’s mother had some issues with… balance, when she got older. But I don’t know the specifics of what she suffered from.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, potential family history of balance issues and some vague recollection of cognitive decline. Let’s proceed with the examination, then. I'm going to assess your gait, balance, reflexes, and some basic cognitive function. Please follow my instructions as best you can. We will start with a simple Romberg test. Can you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and keep your eyes closed for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A test sounds… practical. Thirty seconds with my eyes closed, feet together, arms at my sides. Yes, I believe I can manage that. Here we go. It’s a bit… disorienting already, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s sufficient. You did exhibit some instability, Ms. Snerling. Now, let's try walking heel-to-toe for ten steps. A straight line, if you please. I’ll be walking alongside you.
PATIENT: Heel-to-toe… yes. Instability, you say? I was aware of feeling… unsteady, but to have it confirmed… It’s… proving difficult, Doctor. I apologize. I seem to be… drifting to the side. Perhaps this isn't a good idea? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. Snerling. It's best to stop before you do fall. We'll take this slow. Your gait is significantly impaired. Impaired gait, significant instability. Alright, let's check your reflexes. Please sit on the examination table. We'll start with your knees. I'm going to tap your patellar tendon with this small hammer.
PATIENT: Reflexes, you say? Very well. Patellar tendon… I believe I understand. It’s… comforting to know we’re trying to determine the cause of this. Though, truthfully, the uncertainty is… unnerving. Please proceed when you're ready, Doctor. I’ll try to remain still.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes bilaterally. Diminished reflexes, bilateral. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Cranial nerves… following your finger with my eyes… It’s… proving a bit challenging, Doctor. My eyes feel… heavy. And it’s difficult to focus, if I'm honest. I’m trying my best, though. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Difficulty with smooth pursuit, reports eye fatigue. Ms. Snerling, based on this preliminary neurological examination, your symptoms – memory issues, unsteadiness, diminished reflexes, and difficulty with eye movements – are concerning. I need to order some imaging – an MRI of the brain – to rule out any structural abnormalities. I also want to order blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Imaging… an MRI? Blood work… a neurologist? It sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it something grave? I understand you're doing your due diligence, of course. But the prospect of further tests… and a specialist… it's… overwhelming. If you believe it’s necessary, then yes, I suppose I am agreeable. But… could you perhaps explain what you’re looking for, in layman’s terms? It might… ease my anxiety somewhat.
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it’s understandable to be anxious. We are not jumping to conclusions, but your symptoms warrant investigation. The MRI will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out things like stroke, tumors, or multiple sclerosis – conditions that can cause neurological symptoms. The blood work will help us identify any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid imbalances that might be contributing to your issues. The neurologist is a specialist in the nervous system and can perform a more detailed examination and interpret the results of the tests. I'm looking for a cause, any cause, for these symptoms. It could be something relatively minor, but we need to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stroke… tumors… multiple sclerosis… It’s… a lot to process, Doctor. But yes, I understand. You're trying to rule things out, and find the cause of this… instability. I suppose I would prefer to know, even if the news is… unfavorable. So, yes. I agree to the MRI, the blood work, and the referral to the neurologist. Could you perhaps… explain the process for these tests? And what I should expect afterward? I am quite… apprehensive, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Snerling. Let's start with the MRI. It’s a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It’s quite noisy, so we’ll provide you with earplugs. It takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hairpins. The technologist will explain everything in detail. For the blood work, we’ll draw a few vials of blood here in the office. It takes just a few minutes. As for the neurologist, I’ll send a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. She will review your imaging results, repeat some of the neurological exam, and discuss potential treatment options. We’ll have these results back within a week or so, and we can discuss them at that time. Does that clarify the process?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That clarifies things considerably. No metal objects, noisy machine, a few vials of blood, and Dr. Sharma. I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly. And the timeframe… a week. That’s… manageable. I suppose the waiting will be the most difficult part. But knowing what to expect… that eases my mind somewhat. Is there anything I should do, in the meantime? Any precautions I should take? Besides, of course, avoiding any strenuous activity… or anything that might cause me to fall.
DOCTOR: Given your current instability, I recommend avoiding driving or operating heavy machinery. Limit activities that require a lot of concentration or balance. I also want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any sudden changes – worsening headache, weakness, vision changes, difficulty speaking – go to the emergency room immediately. We'll have the results back quickly, and we'll go from there. I'm prescribing you a walking cane for added support. Here's a prescription for that, and I'll have my nurse print out some instructions on fall prevention and a list of emergency contacts. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A walking cane… yes, that seems… sensible. And fall prevention instructions… of course. I… I suppose not, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. And patient. It’s… a great deal to take in, as I mentioned. But I feel… slightly less anxious, knowing we have a plan. Thank you. I believe that will be all, for now. I’ll… arrange for the cane, and await contact from Dr. Sharma. Thank you again, Doctor Versace.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Snerling. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon. My nurse will escort you to the front desk to schedule a follow-up appointment.
