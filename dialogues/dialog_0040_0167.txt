DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, have a seat. Eighty-seven… right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It’s this foot, you see. It’s been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not good, not good at all. It’s…sore. Very sore when I walk.
DOCTOR: Sore, alright. And how long has this “soreness” been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… two, three months now? Hard to say exactly. Time goes quickly when you get old, you know. I noticed it after I started feelin’ a little weak, and not able to walk as far as I used to. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Weakness and foot pain. Okay. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. But lately, it’s been…more there than not. Especially in the mornings. When I first get up, it’s really bad. I have to sit down for a while before I can put my weight on it. It's a little better after I've been walkin' for a bit, but then it gets tired again. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Morning stiffness, improves with activity, then worsens. Right. Any swelling or redness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it, it is a little red. And…a little puffy. Not a lot, but I can see it, especially around the top of my foot. And… there’s a spot there, kinda open. Like a sore that won’t heal. I put a bandage on it, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Should I be worryin’ about that open spot, Doctor?
DOCTOR: An open sore… Well, we'll have a look. Let's just get this over with. If you could just get up on the table for me, please. We’ll take a look at this foot of yours.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Careful now, old bones ain’t what they used to be. There we go. It's a little chilly in here, isn't it? Is this gonna hurt, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s see. Hmm. Yes, there’s some redness around the top of the foot… and you're right, a small ulceration. Not terribly large, but it's there. Palpation is tender, some warmth. Capillary refill is…slowish. Any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness… not really. Maybe a little…sleepy feeling sometimes? Like it’s not quite awake, if you know what I mean. Especially at night. And sometimes my feet feel cold, even when I’m warm. I thought it was just old age, but now you askin’… it could be that, huh? Is that bad, Doctor? Is this about my sugar? I take pills for that, you know.
DOCTOR: Pills for sugar, alright. Look, Mr. Stoegbauer, it could be related to your diabetes. These ulcers… they’re common in patients with poor circulation. Pulses are weak… very weak. This is…concerning. Do you remember when you last saw your podiatrist?
PATIENT: Podiatrist? Oh dear. Let me think… a podiatrist is the foot doctor, right? I… I don’t think I’ve seen one. Not ever, actually. I usually just take care of things myself. A little bandage here, a little cream there… But this… this is different, isn’t it? I’m afraid I can’t really remember the last time I saw any doctor besides my regular one. Does that help? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it does not help. Look, Mr. Stoegbauer, you've got poor circulation, a slow-healing ulcer, and you haven't seen a foot specialist. This is a recipe for trouble. I'm going to write you a referral to a podiatrist immediately. You need to be seen ASAP. And I want you to schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor to get your diabetes under better control. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… serious. A podiatrist and see my regular doctor? All right, Doctor, if you think so. I trust your judgment. What kind of trouble are we talkin’ about? I get scared easily, you know. Is it gonna be painful? Will I have to… get my leg cut off? Please don’t tell me I need my leg cut off. I heard stories…
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Stoegbauer, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’re nowhere near talking about amputation. But diabetes can cause serious foot problems if it’s not managed. That’s why you need to see these specialists. The podiatrist will assess the wound, check your circulation, and recommend a treatment plan. It might involve special dressings, antibiotics, or even offloading—keeping weight off your foot. It's essential that you follow their instructions. Here. This is the referral. Call this number to schedule an appointment. And I strongly advise you to call today. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A lot to take in… special dressings, antibiotics, offloading… I don’t think I understand what ‘offloading’ means, Doctor. And… is it gonna be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare covers some things, right? And… thank you for not sayin’ anything about my leg. I hope this podiatrist is a nice person…
DOCTOR: ‘Offloading’ means reducing pressure on the foot. You might need a special boot or shoe. As for cost, Medicare should cover a good portion, but you'll need to check with their office. And yes, I expect the podiatrist will be…adequate. Look, Mr. Stoegbauer, I’ve written the referral. You need to follow up. That’s the most important thing. I'm not going to repeat myself. Do you have any other questions, or are we done here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. You’ve told me a lot. I’ll call this podiatrist and see what they say. Thank you for your time… and for not mentionin’ my leg again. I hope you have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Right. Goodbye.
