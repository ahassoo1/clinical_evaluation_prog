DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is the name. Though everyone just calls me Colt. It’s… well, it’s been my wife, Somnang, really. She says I’ve been… forgetting things. Not big things, you understand. Just… little things. She worries, and frankly, she can be a bit much sometimes. But she booked the appointment, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Colt. It’s very thoughtful of both you and Somnang to address this proactively. It's common for family members to notice subtle changes, and it’s good you're both taking this seriously. When Somnang says you've been "forgetting things," could you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Examples… hmm. Well, just yesterday, I went to get the mail, and I completely forgot which house number we are. Somnang had to tell me. We’ve lived there for fifteen years! Fifteen years, Doctor! And then, a few weeks ago, I started making a pot of tea, and… I just wandered off. Completely forgot about it until she smelled it burning. Small things. Annoying things, mostly. Not like I'm losing my mind, you understand. Just… a lapse. A little… blank spot.
DOCTOR: I understand, Colt. Those do sound concerning, even if they seem small. Forgetting familiar details like your house number, or leaving something unattended on the stove… those are changes we should investigate. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me about how long you've been noticing these instances?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not recent, exactly. Maybe… six months, give or take? It started slowly. I’d misplace my glasses, then forget where I put the remote. Somnang says I ask the same questions repeatedly. It’s been gradual, that's for sure. Not like one day I was perfectly fine, and the next… well, you know. I'm still capable, Doctor. Still do all the tiling work. Best in the county, if I do say so myself. Though sometimes… sometimes I need her to double-check my measurements. Just to be safe. She insists, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Colt. The gradual onset is important. And it's good to hear you’re still actively working and capable. Let's talk about other areas of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Mood? No, not really. I get… frustrated, maybe. Especially when I can’t remember something. But that’s just… me. Always been a bit short-tempered. Sleep… well, I sleep alright. Wake up a few times a night to use the bathroom, as any man my age does. Appetite is fine. Somnang makes excellent Khmer food, you know. Always has. Always will. I'm eating everything I normally eat. No, nothing like that. I just... can't recall things as easily as I used to. Is that so hard to understand? It’s not like I’m suddenly a different person.
DOCTOR: No, Colt, it’s not hard to understand at all. And I appreciate you being so candid with me. It sounds like these memory lapses are the primary concern, and that other aspects of your health haven't changed significantly. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must be… twenty years now? And I had a bit of a bad back for a while, from all the tiling. But that's sorted now. Physiotherapy helped. Other than that… no. I’ve always been a healthy man. Good genes, I suppose. Somnang’s family, too. Long lifespans, good health. I don't take any medication regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever for my hands when I’ve been doing a lot of work. Nothing serious. Really. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? It feels like a lot of questions for a few little memory slips.
DOCTOR: We are, Colt, we are. Gathering a comprehensive history is crucial. It helps us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. You mentioned no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. Somnang always asks when we go to a new restaurant, and I always tell her the same thing: nothing. I eat everything. She worries about food poisoning, but I've never had a problem. Dust bothers me sometimes, from the tiling, but that's just… dust. Everyone gets a bit stuffy with dust, don’t they? No allergies. No sensitivities. A perfectly healthy man, Doctor. I keep telling you. It's just this… this forgetfulness. And frankly, I'm starting to feel like you’re looking for something serious where there isn’t anything. Are you sure this isn’t just normal aging? Because Somnang… she’s a worrier. A professional worrier.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Colt, and I assure you I’m not necessarily looking for something serious. However, it's my responsibility to investigate any changes in your health to determine the cause and ensure you receive the appropriate care. It could be normal aging, and that's certainly something we'll consider. But, given the progression you’ve described, and to rule out other possibilities, I would like to perform a brief physical and neurological exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? For a few memory slips? Doctor, with all due respect… I came here because my wife insisted. I feel perfectly fine. Strong as an ox, still doing my work. What exactly are you hoping to find with a physical exam? I’m starting to suspect you’re just trying to justify the appointment fee. And frankly, I have a job to get back to. Somnang took the afternoon off to bring me, and she’s expecting me home. I don’t understand what poking and prodding is going to accomplish. I'm a tile setter, not a science experiment.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Colt, and I apologize if I’ve caused any frustration. You’re right to question the necessity of a physical exam. The purpose isn't to suggest there's necessarily something seriously wrong, but rather to gather more information. A neurological exam, specifically, can help assess things like your reflexes, balance, coordination, and cognitive function. These are all indicators that can point to the potential cause of memory changes. It’s a relatively quick and painless process. It’s important to rule out things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or early signs of neurological conditions. It is standard medical practice. If everything checks out, we can reassess and discuss normal aging. Ultimately, the goal is to provide you with the most accurate information and peace of mind. Would you be willing to allow me to proceed with a brief exam, just to ensure we haven’t overlooked anything?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But make it quick. And no poking around unnecessarily. I have tiles to lay, Doctor. And Somnang will have my hide if I'm late. Just get it over with. But I'm telling you, you're wasting your time. And mine. Just… just get on with it. But no needles. Absolutely no needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Colt. No needles, I assure you. And I will keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your reflexes and coordination. Finally, I'll ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Just hurry it up, Doctor. I haven't got all day. And try not to make me feel like an idiot with your questions. I know I forget things, that's why I'm here, isn't it? Now, get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Deep breaths in and out, if you would. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Just get it over with. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Best tile setter in the county. Can’t be spending all day in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Good. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, let's move on to your coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that enough poking and prodding for you? I’m starting to feel ridiculous. This isn’t a scientific experiment, is it? I just wanted a note to tell my wife I went to the doctor. Now, let's get to the questions. Get it over with quickly. I know my memory isn’t what it used to be. You don’t need a medical degree to figure that out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Just a few simple questions, as you requested. First, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: What year it is? Really, Doctor? Are you serious? It's… 2025. August 2nd, 2025. Though I’ve got better things to remember than the date, honestly. Like grout lines and tile patterns. Now, are we finished yet? This is getting absurd.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you tell me the names of three objects that I name?
PATIENT: Three objects? What objects? You haven’t named any objects! Are you trying to trick me? This is a waste of my time, Doctor. I came here because Somnang insisted, and frankly, this is just… insulting. Name the objects first, then ask me to remember them. It's not exactly rocket science.
DOCTOR: You are right to call me out on that. Please forgive my oversight. Let’s try this. I will name three objects. Please repeat them back to me. The objects are: apple, chair, and penny.
PATIENT: Apple, chair, and… penny. There. Happy now? Are we finished yet? This is ridiculous. I’m a tile setter, not a… a memory patient! Just tell me if I’m okay or not and let me get back to work. Somnang’s going to kill me if I’m late. And frankly, I'm starting to feel… agitated. Just get on with it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your recent memory. Can you recall what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Breakfast? Oh, honestly… Somnang made… some kind of noodle soup. With pork. And… vegetables. I don't pay much attention to what I eat, to be honest. She just puts it in front of me. It was… breakfast. A perfectly normal breakfast. Is that what you wanted to know? This is a complete waste of time, Doctor. I'm a practical man, a craftsman. I don’t need to remember every detail of my meals.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Thank you for your patience. I've completed the exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief neurological assessment, you exhibit some mild memory lapses, particularly with recent recall. You are alert and oriented, and your neurological function appears generally intact. You did have some slight difficulty recalling what you had for breakfast, which is consistent with your wife’s concerns. The agitation you’re feeling is understandable, given your frustration with the process. I wouldn’t say there’s anything drastically wrong, but given the progressive nature of these memory lapses, and the fact that it's impacting your daily life, I would recommend further evaluation. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I would also recommend a cognitive assessment with a neurologist. They can perform more comprehensive testing and provide a more definitive diagnosis. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a neurologist… Honestly, Doctor. It's just… forgetfulness. I'm an old man. Old men forget things. It’s a natural part of life. I don't want to be poked and prodded and sent to a specialist. I just want to go back to work and lay some tiles. Somnang… she’s going to be thrilled. More appointments, more tests… Fine. Do your tests. But if everything comes back normal, I'm not going to a neurologist. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I’ll deal with it myself. Just… get it over with. And quickly, if you please. I have a reputation to uphold. Best tile setter in the county, you know. And I’m wasting valuable time sitting here. Just… give me the paperwork.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Colt. And I respect your decision. We can start with the blood tests, and if everything comes back normal, we can reassess. We can always discuss alternative approaches if you are not comfortable with a neurological referral. Here are the lab forms. You can have your blood drawn at the clinic lab, or at any lab convenient to you. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend getting a good night's rest and staying mentally active. Engaging in hobbies you enjoy can also help with cognitive function. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I have tiles to lay. And a wife to appease. Honestly, Doctor… you've made me feel like an old man. Just… thank you. I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Colt. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and be careful laying those tiles.
