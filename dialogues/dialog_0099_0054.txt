DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hi Doctor. Cough, lah. Been coughing for...long time already. And tired also. So tired. I dunno how long, exactly. Maybe months? I keep getting sinus also, the nose, you know? Blocked up, always.
DOCTOR: Months, you say. Alright. A cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion… that's a fairly broad set of symptoms. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When you say “long time,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Uh...before the rainy season, I think. Yeah, before the really bad rain started. Does that help? I work outside, fixing tires, so…maybe when it got humid, it got worse? I forget, lah. It’s hard to remember everything when you busy.
DOCTOR: Right. Before the rainy season... so, roughly three months, give or take. And it's exacerbated by humidity, you think. And this cough... is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?
PATIENT: Bringing up? Like...phlegm? Yeah, sometimes, lah. Not always, but sometimes. Clear one, sometimes white. Sometimes a bit...yellowish, I think. When I sleep, also, sometimes I cough a lot. Wake up wife also. She complain.
DOCTOR: Okay. Clear or white phlegm, occasionally yellowish, worse at night. And it’s disrupting your wife’s sleep. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever? Not really, lah. I check sometimes, with the thermometer wife buy, but normal, usually. Maybe a bit warm, sometimes, but not like, really sick warm. Body ache…sometimes, after work, you know? But that’s from lifting tires all day, I think. Not from the cough.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no significant fever, body aches mostly attributed to your work. And this congestion… is it just your nose, or do you feel it in your chest at all?
PATIENT: Chest? Hmm…sometimes, a bit blocked, yeah. Like…hard to breathe deep. Not always, but when I climb stairs, I get a bit…wheezy, I think that’s the word. Wife says I sound like a cat, when I breathe.
DOCTOR: Wheezing. Alright. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, lah. Never smoke. Wife also no like. Bad for health, she say. Always say that. I drink coffee, sometimes, after work, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Good. Any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh...I dunno, lah. Maybe dust? Sometimes when I'm cleaning tires, I sneeze a lot. But everyone sneeze when there's dust, right? I never go to doctor about it. Just normal, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Lung conditions? Uh...no, I don't think so, lah. Never go to doctor much, you know? Just little cough, little fever, wife give me medicine. I think one time, long time ago, when I was kid, I had very bad cough. But I forget what doctor say.
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited medical history. Any surgeries, hospitalizations, or serious injuries?
PATIENT: Serious injuries? Uh...one time, I cut my hand with tire iron. But just small cut, wife bandage it. No hospital, no surgery. Nothing like that, lah. Just normal work accidents. I always careful, but sometimes…things happen.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Uh…my mother, she have…heart problem, I think. Long time ago, she got sick, very sick. She take medicine for it. My father, he okay, always healthy. He farmer, very strong. My wife's mother, she have diabetes, I think. That's all I remember, lah. They all live far away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Uh...just the cough syrup wife buy from shop. When I cough really bad, she give me. Sometimes panadol, when I have headache. Nothing else, lah. No regular medicine, I think. She always take care of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati. Well, it sounds like you’ve been dealing with this cough for quite some time. Given your symptoms – the prolonged cough, fatigue, occasional yellowish phlegm, and some wheezing – it could be a number of things. It’s possible it's a chronic bronchitis, perhaps aggravated by your work environment. However, we can’t rule out other possibilities without further investigation. I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Then, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some basic blood work to rule out infection or other underlying conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Uh…okay, I think, lah. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to stop coughing, you know? It’s tiring. Is it expensive? I…don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get it sorted. Let’s start with the examination. As for the cost, I understand your concern. We’ll see what your insurance covers – though you mentioned you aren't insured – and we can discuss options if it's going to be a financial burden. We have some programs that might be able to help. But first, let's get some information. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Take deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths, you say? I try, lah. But sometimes…hard to breathe deep.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take another deep breath... and exhale slowly. And again. Hmm... I'm hearing some wheezing on both sides, and a few crackles at the base of your left lung. It’s not severe, but it's consistent with some inflammation. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is acceptable, but borderline. Now, could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: “Ah…” Is everything okay, Doctor? It doesn't hurt or anything, but…I worry.
DOCTOR: Everything is okay for now. Your throat is a little red, but nothing significant. It could be from the cough. Alright, Mr. Tati. Based on what I've heard and seen, I'm going to order that chest X-ray and blood work. We need to rule out pneumonia or any other underlying lung conditions. The blood work will check for infection and assess your overall health. I'll also prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open your airways and ease your breathing. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Inhaler? What does that do? And X-ray…is it safe? I worry about…radiation, you know? My wife, she read something about that. Will it show everything? I just want to know what’s wrong, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs, helping to relax the muscles and open your airways. It’s very safe and should make it easier to breathe. As for the X-ray, the amount of radiation is minimal – it's equivalent to what you're exposed to during a long-haul flight. The benefits of diagnosing the problem far outweigh the small risk. It's a standard procedure, and we take every precaution to minimize exposure. It will show us whether there’s any sign of pneumonia, bronchitis, or other abnormalities in your lungs. It's not perfect, but it’s a crucial first step in determining the cause of your symptoms. We'll discuss the results thoroughly once they're available. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay…long-haul flight, you say? My wife, she always wants to go to Australia. But I scared of flying. So, little bit of radiation, like flying…and inhaler to help breathing. Okay, I think I understand. When will I get the results? And where do I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Good. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street – here’s the referral form. Tell them you were sent by Dr. Overgaard. They should be able to fit you in today. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. Here’s the prescription for the inhaler – you can fill it at the pharmacy near the clinic. Use it as directed – two puffs every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath. Now, I want you to monitor your symptoms carefully. If you experience any chest pain, high fever, or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chest pain…high fever…emergency room. Okay, I remember. Two puffs, every four to six hours. Pharmacy near the clinic. Okay, okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I hope the X-ray shows nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's hope so too. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. NEXT!
