DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back… it hurts really bad. It’s been hurting for a while, but now… now it’s hard to even stand up straight. It’s in my lower back, mostly. And I… I have the cancer, you know? So I get worried when new things hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, I understand. Back pain is definitely something we want to get to the bottom of, especially with your history of cancer. It's good you’re bringing it up and getting it checked out. “Hurting for a while” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Just a little ache after I work. I do… packing boxes at the factory, you know? Lots of bending and lifting. I thought it was just from that. I took some pills, the regular kind for aches, and it went away. But then, about a week ago, it came back, and it wouldn’t go away. And it’s gotten worse each day. Now… now it feels like something is… stuck. And it hurts to breathe sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Six months ago with the ache after work, then it subsided, and now it’s returned a week ago and is progressively worsening with pain on breathing… that gives me a clearer picture. When you say “pain on breathing,” can you describe where exactly you feel that pain when you take a breath?
PATIENT: It’s… not with every breath, Doctor. It’s when I try to take a deep breath. And it’s… right across my back, kinda where my shoulder blades are. Not right on the blades, but… lower, where they meet my back. And it feels… sharp. Not a dull ache, but a real sharp pain when I push the air in. And it makes me kinda gasp sometimes, if I try too hard. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain with deep breaths, localized to the lower scapular region… that’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s scary, which is completely understandable. We'll figure this out. Now, besides the pain with deep breaths and the difficulty standing, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… My legs feel kinda… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, just when I’m standing for a long time at work. And… I've been feeling tired, even more than usual. I thought it was just from the pain, keeping me up at night. But… yeah, tired, and the tingly legs. Oh! And I’ve been going to the bathroom… more often. Like, I have to go a lot. Not… diarrhea or anything, just… more frequent. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in the legs with prolonged standing, increased fatigue, and more frequent urination… those are all things we need to consider. The increased frequency of urination is definitely something to note. Have you noticed any change in the color of your urine, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning or pain when I go. The color… it looks normal, I think. Maybe a little darker than usual, but I drink a lot of water, so it’s usually pretty clear. I haven’t really looked at it closely, to be honest. I just know I’m going more often. And… sometimes it’s hard to… start. Like, I have to push a little. But it comes out okay. It just doesn't come easily. Does that make sense? I don’t want to bother you with too much detail.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not bothering me at all, Larin. It’s important to give me as much detail as possible. Difficulty initiating urination, even if it eventually comes out okay, is good information. Okay, let’s switch gears for a moment. Could you tell me a little bit about your cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… in my lungs. They found it about two years ago. It’s… not the kind that spreads fast, the doctor said. I've been getting… treatment. Pills and… sometimes radiation. It’s been… okay. The scans have been… stable. But… I worry about it coming back. That’s why I get scared when something new hurts. It's the pills… they make me tired a lot, and sometimes my stomach hurts. I’m supposed to see the cancer doctor next month for another scan.
DOCTOR: Okay, lung cancer with stable scans, treatment with pills and radiation, and fatigue and stomach discomfort as side effects… that gives me a good understanding of your overall health picture. Now, regarding your current back pain, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, and we'll start with some basic movements and palpation to assess the area. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. I’m… a little worried, but I trust you, Doctor. I’ll lie down. Just… be gentle, okay? It really hurts when you push on it. And… I might gasp if you touch it in just the right spot. I’m sorry if I make noises.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle, Larin. And it’s perfectly alright if you gasp or make any noises – just let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable. Okay, let's start by having you bend forward as far as you comfortably can. Just go as far as you can without forcing it. Okay… and now, can you try to bend backward a little?
PATIENT: Ooooh… that hurts. A lot. I can’t go much further. It feels like something is going to… snap. Now… backwards? Okay… No… I can’t. It hurts too much. It feels like it's locking up. I think something is locking up. It’s scary, Doctor. I don’t want to break something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, that’s enough. Don’t push yourself. It’s good you told me. I can see you’re in significant discomfort. Now, I’m going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around your back. Please tell me immediately if you feel any sharp pain or if anything is particularly sensitive. Okay… how about here?
PATIENT: Ooooh! Yes! That’s it! Right there! That hurts! It’s… sharp, like a knife. And… it makes me want to pull away. It's not just the muscle, it feels like… inside. And… it’s cold. Does that make sense? It feels… cold and sharp. Like something is stuck. And… and it makes me feel dizzy a little. Please… be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, I hear you. Sharp, internal pain, a cold sensation, and dizziness… that's concerning. I won’t touch that area again without letting you know first. Based on what you’ve told me, and the pain you’re experiencing, I'm worried about a possible nerve compression or even something affecting your kidneys. The dizziness could be related to pain, but we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood work will help us assess your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. The CT scan will give us a more detailed look at your spine, kidneys, and other internal organs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. A scan… and blood work. Okay. If you think that’s best. I just… I want to know what’s wrong. I don’t like feeling like this. And… is it the cancer? Is it spreading? Please… tell me the truth. Even if it's bad news. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Larin, I understand your worry, and you're right to want answers. It’s good you’re being so direct. It’s possible the pain is related to your cancer, but it’s also possible it’s something completely separate. We need the results of the tests to know for sure. Jumping to conclusions won’t help us, and I promise I will be completely honest with you about everything we find. The CT scan will help us determine if there's any evidence of cancer spread, but it will also look for other potential causes of your pain, like kidney stones, infection, or nerve compression. I’m going to write the orders for the blood work and CT scan now. The lab is right down the hall, and the radiology department is on the third floor. They'll let you know when they're ready for you. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you some pain medication to help you feel more comfortable while we wait for the results. I want you to know I’m here for you, and we'll work through this together. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for being honest. I’m scared, but… I feel a little better knowing you’re trying to figure it out. Can… can I call you if I think of something later? Or if the pain gets worse?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Larin. Please call us anytime, day or night, if you have any questions or if your pain gets worse. My nurse, Sarah, will give you our contact information before you leave. Don't hesitate to reach out. I’m going to let Sarah come in and get you some pain relief, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the tests. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. .
