DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just…dry eyes. Been bad lately. Hurts to blink sometimes. Don't need a lot of time, if that's alright. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. We'll be as efficient as possible. Dry eyes can be quite bothersome, and we want to address that for you. To start, could you describe the dryness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it just feels…scratchy. Like sand. Especially when I'm outside. Wind makes it worse. And when I wake up in the morning, feels like I haven't blinked all night. Not sure what to tell you other than that. It's just…dry. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Pipolo. “Scratchy, like sand,” and worse in the wind, and prominent upon waking – that gives me a good starting point. It sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with dry eye disease. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Other… hmm. Sometimes things look a little blurry. Not all the time, just now and then. And sometimes it feels like something is in my eye, even when it isn’t. Makes me rub 'em, which probably isn't good. Is that what you mean? Like, other stuff going on with the dry?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly, Mr. Pipolo. The blurry vision and the sensation of something in your eye are quite common with dry eye, and you are correct – rubbing your eyes can exacerbate the issue. Have you ever been diagnosed with dry eye before, or had any treatment for it in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. This is all new to me. I'm 83 years old, Doc. Never had much trouble with my eyes 'til now. Just…started happening a few months ago. No treatments, no doctors, nothing. Just me and the dryness.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pipolo. It’s not uncommon for dry eye to develop with age. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any other medical conditions – such as arthritis, diabetes, or Sjogren’s syndrome – or take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Arthritis in my hands, yes. Makes it hard to work sometimes, but that's about it. No diabetes. Never been told that. And no, don't take any pills or nothing. Just try to stay busy, keep working as long as I can. Cement work keeps a man moving, you know? Don’t need fancy medicines.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Pipolo. Arthritis can sometimes be associated with dry eye, so that is helpful information. And cement work certainly does keep a man moving! To get a better understanding of the dryness, could you tell me about your typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day… well, I get up early. Work on the job site 'til about 4, 5. Lots of dust, concrete, wind. Comes with the territory. Then home, supper, maybe watch a little TV. And that's it. Weekends I try to fix things around the house, garden a little. Not much excitement. And a lot of being outside. That probably doesn’t help the eyes, huh? Being out in the weather all the time.
DOCTOR: No, being outdoors frequently, particularly in dusty or windy conditions, likely does contribute to the dryness, Mr. Pipolo. Now, to get a closer look, would you mind if I performed a quick eye exam?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Just make it quick, alright? Got things to do, like I said. Don't want to be here all day. Hope it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo, I’ll be as efficient as possible. It shouldn’t hurt at all; it's a fairly straightforward examination. Alright, Mr. Pipolo, looking at your eyes now… I see some mild redness, and your tear film appears to be breaking up a little too quickly. I'll also check your blink rate. Your blink rate seems a little reduced, which can contribute to dryness. I'll use a small strip to measure your tear production. Okay, that's enough for now. The Schirmer test shows your tear production is slightly below normal. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with mild to moderate dry eye disease.
PATIENT: Mild to moderate… great. Sounds complicated. What does that mean? And what can I do about it? Don’t want fancy medicines, remember. Just something simple. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask what that means, Mr. Pipolo. “Mild to moderate” simply indicates the severity of the dryness. It’s not severe enough to cause significant vision problems, but it is enough to cause you discomfort and warrants attention. And I absolutely understand your desire to avoid “fancy medicines.” Thankfully, there are several simple things we can try. The first step is artificial tears. These are lubricating eye drops that you can use several times a day to help keep your eyes moist. I recommend a preservative-free variety, as preservatives can sometimes cause irritation. We can also consider a simple environmental modification – wearing wraparound sunglasses when you’re outside, to protect your eyes from wind and dust. And consciously blinking more often, especially when you’re focusing on something for a long period, can help. Would you like me to write you a prescription for preservative-free artificial tears?
PATIENT: Artificial tears… alright. Sounds simple enough. Wraparound glasses I can do. And I'll try to blink more. You think that’ll really help? Yeah, go ahead and write a prescription. Preservative-free. Don’t want any irritation. Just want to be able to see, Doc. That’s all. And how long does it take to work? Got work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Pipolo. I'm glad you're willing to try those measures. Yes, consciously blinking more often can surprisingly make a significant difference. It helps redistribute the tear film across the surface of your eye and prevents it from evaporating too quickly. I’ll write the prescription for preservative-free artificial tears now. You can use them as often as needed, typically 2-4 times a day, or even more frequently if your eyes feel particularly dry. You should notice some improvement within a few days, but it may take a week or two to experience the full benefit. I recommend starting with one type of artificial tear and seeing how you respond. If it doesn't provide enough relief, we can try a different brand or formulation. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just gotta keep working, Doc. Thanks for not making it too complicated. I appreciate that. Tell me where I pick up the drops. And try not to keep me too long, alright? Time is money, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I understand your time is valuable. The prescription is sent electronically to [Local Pharmacy Name]. They should be ready within the next few hours. I've also printed out a brief summary of our discussion and the recommendations we made. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. I wish you all the best with your work, and I hope the artificial tears provide some relief. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
