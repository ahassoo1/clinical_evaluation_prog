DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me… ah yes. My wife and I… we are thinking about… a baby. Maybe. We want to see if… everything is okay, you know? To have one. We are… not so young anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Carlotta. It’s very responsible of both of you to want to ensure everything is in good working order before trying to conceive, regardless of age. So, to clarify, you and your wife are considering starting a family, and you’d like a check-up to assess your overall health and fertility?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is right. A check-up. To make sure… everything works. My wife, she is healthy, I think. But me… I am old. Maybe not so good anymore. I make little things with my hands… metal and plastic… but… a baby is different, yes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. It’s wise to consider all aspects. And it's good you’re thinking proactively. I want to get a good picture of your overall health. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor, and if so, when was your last check-up?
PATIENT: Hmm… a regular doctor… yes, I had one. A long time ago, I think. In the city. Before we move here… to the country. Last check-up… oh dear. That was… a very long time ago. Maybe five years? More? I forget easily, you see. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years ago or more is a bit of a gap, but we'll get you updated. Medicare is helpful, yes, it allows me to see some of your previous history, but it’s always best to go over things directly with you. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Major… illnesses? Let me think… I had a bad cough, once. Very bad. But I took some medicine and it went away. Surgeries… I broke my arm when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. They put it in a cast. That’s all I remember, really. Nothing else important, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough and a broken arm as a child. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… vitamins… hmm. I take something for my knees, sometimes. They hurt in the cold weather. A little pill. My wife buys it for me. I don’t remember the name… it’s a white pill. And I take… a multivitamin, maybe? She gives it to me with breakfast. Something for old people, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for your knees and a multivitamin. We’ll try to get the name of the knee medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I eat everything. My wife cooks very good food. Spicy food, sometimes! No problems. I don’t… get rashes, or… feel sick after eating. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoke. Bad for you, you know. My father smoke, and he… he got very sick. No, never smoke. My wife, she doesn't like smoking either.
DOCTOR: Good. That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes, a little. With dinner. A small glass of wine, maybe. On special occasions. Not every day. My wife and I… we don't drink much. We prefer tea, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your work. What do you do for a living?
PATIENT: I make little things. With my hands. Model makers, they call it. Metal and plastic. I used to make bigger things, in the city… but now, small things. For… for people. I work at home. In my workshop.
DOCTOR: Model making, that sounds interesting. Do you experience any difficulties with your work, like pain or limitations in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my hands hurt. After a long day. A little stiff. And my back… it gets sore, sometimes. From bending over the workbench. But I manage. I have to, you see. It is how I… provide. I rub it with a cream my wife makes.
DOCTOR: Alright, some hand and back discomfort with work. We’ll need to assess that a bit further. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That is a difficult question. My family… they lived far away. In Somalia. I don’t… see them very often. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. My father… he got sick with his lungs. But I don’t know much more than that. We didn't talk about these things, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for families to not discuss medical history. We’ll work with what we have. Okay, Mr. Carlotta. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. I want to make sure… everything is okay. For my wife and… maybe, a baby.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and back, to see if we can identify the source of your discomfort. Please, have a seat on the table. First, let's get your height and weight.
PATIENT: Okay. I am not very tall, you know. Small man. But strong, I think!
DOCTOR: Alright, 164 centimeters and 96 kilograms. Thank you. Now, if you could please take a seat. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply for me. Everything sounds… clear, but a little rapid. I’ll document that. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It hurts a little… the knuckles. And my wrists… they feel stiff.
DOCTOR: I see some slight swelling and tenderness around the knuckles, and a limited range of motion in the wrists. It looks like there may be some early signs of osteoarthritis. I’ll document that as well. Now, let's check your back. Could you please bend forward for me, and then stand up straight?
PATIENT: Oof… that is… not easy. It feels stiff there… in the lower back. And sometimes… a little pain. It gets worse when I bend over my workbench.
DOCTOR: I feel some muscle tension and tenderness in the lower lumbar region. It appears to be some mild lumbar strain. I'm documenting everything. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems we're dealing with some early signs of osteoarthritis in your hands and some mild lumbar strain in your lower back. Given your age and desire to potentially start a family, I would like to order some blood work to check your overall health and hormone levels. Also, an X-ray of your hands might be helpful to confirm the osteoarthritis and assess its severity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work… and the X-ray… I trust you. Hormone levels? Is that… important for a baby? I don't understand everything.
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Carlotta. Checking your hormone levels will help us understand if everything is functioning optimally for potential conception. As we age, hormone levels naturally decline, and sometimes they need a little boost to help things along. It's a routine test, and it will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and fertility potential. The blood work will also assess your kidney and liver function, and check for any other underlying health issues. I'll write you a requisition for the blood work and an order for the X-ray. The nurse will explain where to go to get those done. Would you like me to go over any of the instructions with you now, or do you prefer to speak with the nurse?
PATIENT: I think… the nurse would be good. I forget things easily, you see. She can explain it slowly. And… write it down for me? That would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I'll make a detailed note for the nurse to explain everything clearly and provide you with written instructions. I also want to mention, based on your blood pressure reading, it would be a good idea to monitor it at home. I'll have the nurse show you how to do that properly. For now, we'll wait for the results of the blood work and X-ray. Once we have those, we can discuss a plan of action, which may include lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, or potentially medication. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You have explained everything very well. My wife… she will have questions, I’m sure. But… I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you or your wife have any questions in the meantime. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and schedule the tests. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
