DOCTOR: Hi Arlan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Ranjan, you say? Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems I’m going all the time now. It’s a bother, really. More of a nuisance than anything, but my wife, bless her heart, thought I ought to get it checked. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly can be frustrating when things change, and it’s good of your wife to encourage you to come in. Frequent urination can have a lot of different causes, so it’s good we're looking into it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, details, details… That’s what I’m bad at remembering. Let me see… it’s not painful, exactly. Just… often. Especially at night. Waking me up, you know? And sometimes during the day too, if I drink a bit of tea. Though I haven't changed how much tea I drink. It’s always been a couple of cups. Maybe three, on a cold day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not painful, just frequent, especially at night and sometimes with tea. And you haven't changed your tea intake. That’s helpful to know. About how many times would you say you're going to the bathroom during the day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. More than usual, certainly. Used to be… well, a normal amount, I suppose. Now? Hmm… let me think. During the day… probably every… two, three hours? Maybe less. It’s hard to keep track, you know? I'm not one for counting bathroom trips. It feels like a lot, though. Definitely more than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several times during the day – every two to three hours, or sometimes more often. And you mentioned it wakes you up at night – how many times would you say you get up to go to the bathroom during the night?
PATIENT: Oh, the night is the worst part. Used to sleep right through, you know? Now… let me see… sometimes just once. But other times… two, three times. Maybe even four, on a bad night. It’s tiring, Doctor. Really tiring. Makes for a grumpy old man, that's for sure. My wife doesn’t like it much when I’m grumpy.
DOCTOR: I can imagine that would be very disruptive to your sleep, and I apologize that you're dealing with that. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me a little about any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, I feel a bit… weaker, maybe? Not sick, exactly. Just… not as strong as I used to be. And sometimes I feel a little… shaky. But I'm an old man, Doctor. I expect a bit of shakiness at my age. Is that what you mean? I don't have a fever or anything. And no pain, like I said. Just tired and going to the bathroom a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, some weakness and occasional shakiness, but no fever or pain. And you’ve mentioned fatigue as well. That’s good information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… urine? Now you're asking about things I really don't pay attention to. Let me think… it looks normal, I suppose. Yellow. Maybe a little darker sometimes. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything like that. Honestly, I don’t stare at my… well, you know. It’s just… urine. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable! No, you shouldn't necessarily be looking for anything, but I just wanted to rule out any obvious changes. Okay, let’s switch gears a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… my blood pressure’s been a little high for years, the doctor back home used to say. I take a little pill for it, I think. A white one. Can't remember the name. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but they fixed it with… well, something. A lot of years ago. Other than that… no, not really. I've been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Farm work keeps you moving, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication – we’ll try to get the name of that later – and some history of heart trouble that was addressed some time ago. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And… and I think I had a little something done on my knee years back, but it was a small thing. Farm accident. Nothing major. Nothing else comes to mind, no. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Kept out of the doctor’s office as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a minor knee surgery. And you've been generally healthy otherwise. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father had a weak heart, I think. Died young, he did. And my mother… she had some trouble with her stomach, but I don’t know what exactly. Old country problems, probably. Not much in the way of doctors back then. People just… suffered. It wasn't like it is now, with all the fancy tests and pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and some stomach issues on your mother's side. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with food or anything. I take that white pill for my blood pressure, like I said, and I haven't had any reactions to that. I've always been able to eat anything put in front of me. A strong stomach, I suppose. Comes from farm work, maybe.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, Arlan, I think I have a good start on your history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible. Can't hurt to look things over, I suppose. Just don't poke too much. Old bones, you know. A little tender.
DOCTOR: I’ll be gentle, I promise. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There you go. Always been a bit of a smoker, you know. Not as much now, but… it catches up to you eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, which is likely related to your smoking history. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but the rhythm is regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back if you’re comfortable. I’m not feeling any significant tenderness, but your abdomen is a little distended. Is this normal for you?
PATIENT: Distended? Oh, I don't know about distended. Maybe a little. I've always been a bit… round, you know? Good food, and not enough exercise these days. It hasn’t bothered me, though. My wife always says I need to watch my weight, but… what's life without a good meal?
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: There you go. Getting old, you know. Eyes aren’t what they used to be. Little blurry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, and your strength is slightly reduced in your lower extremities, but nothing too concerning for your age. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with a few potential issues. The frequent urination could be related to an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age, or potentially a bladder issue. The fatigue and weakness could be related to a number of factors, including your age, smoking history, and possible prostate issues. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? Well, I suppose it’s sensible. Can’t fix anything without knowing what’s wrong, can you? What kind of tests are we talking about? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles. We’ll try to minimize discomfort as much as possible. I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and other abnormalities, a blood test to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which can help us assess your prostate health. And I’d also like to do a digital rectal exam, or DRE, to physically assess the size and shape of your prostate. It’s a quick exam, but it can provide valuable information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a digital what now? Oh, dear. Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? That sounds… unpleasant. I suppose if you really need to, but I’d prefer to avoid it if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arlan. It’s not the most comfortable exam, but it is a very important part of assessing prostate health, especially given your symptoms. It helps us feel for any abnormalities in the size, shape, or texture of the prostate. While we can proceed without it, it would limit our ability to accurately assess the cause of your symptoms. However, we can discuss alternatives, or potentially proceed with more advanced imaging if you're strongly opposed. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, dear. Alright, alright. If you really think it’s necessary… just… be quick about it, Doctor. And… and explain what you’re doing beforehand. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything step-by-step before we proceed. It will only take a few moments, and I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. Before we do that, though, let’s get the urine and blood samples done. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood, and I’ll give you a cup to collect a urine sample. We can do the DRE afterward. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright. Urine and blood first, then… the other thing. Just… let's get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse come in right away to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. While you’re waiting, I’ll document our findings and prepare a plan for you. Once we have the test results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, please try to drink plenty of fluids and avoid caffeine, as that can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… try to be gentle, Doctor. That's all I ask. And thank you… for listening. It’s good to finally get this checked out. It's been bothering me for a while, and my wife will be glad I came.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arlan. I’m happy to help. And I will certainly do my best to be gentle. The nurse should be in shortly to take your blood. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time.
