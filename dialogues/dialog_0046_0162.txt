DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a lot of small talk, Doc. Just…bloating, okay? Been happening for a bit. Feels like I’m gonna burst. That’s it. Can we just…figure out what I need to take to make it stop?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand you’re experiencing bloating and want to find a solution quickly. I’ll do my best to help. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, "a bit more"? What do you need to know? It’s my stomach, it puffs up. After I eat, usually. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Sometimes it’s worse than others, I guess. Honestly, I don’t pay that close attention. I just want it gone. Is that enough “more” for you? I got stuff to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Kristofik, and I understand you're busy. It is helpful to know it happens after eating, regardless of the food type, and that the severity varies. When did this bloating start?
PATIENT: Honestly? No idea. A while ago. Months, probably. Maybe longer? Look, my wife…she usually handled all this doctor stuff. I don't really…remember specifics. It just started being annoying. Is that good enough? I really don’t do well with dates and timelines, Doc. It’s just…a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kristofik. We can work with that. So, it’s been ongoing for several months, at least. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing?
PATIENT: Changed? Like what? My job’s the same, I live in the same place… I mean, my wife passed last year, so… everything's different, I suppose. But specifically about the bloating? No, not that I recall. Look, I eat, I work, I try to sleep. Not much excitement happening in my life these days. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious, Doc. Probably just old age catching up to me.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Kristofik. Losing a loved one is a significant life change, and it can certainly affect many aspects of your well-being. Regarding the bloating, while it may seem minor, it’s important to investigate to rule out any underlying causes. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what the bloating feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Feels like… like I swallowed a balloon, okay? Like my stomach is all stretched out and tight. And…gassy. A lot of gas. Not comfortable. It’s not painful, exactly, just…unpleasant. It makes my clothes feel tight, and I feel…full, even if I haven’t eaten much. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. Is that what you want? A detailed description of my stomach problems? It's not a pleasant topic, Doc.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Mr. Kristofik, thank you. "Stretched out and tight" and feeling full despite not eating much gives me a better idea. You mentioned it’s not painful, but does it cause you any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I… I guess sometimes I feel a little tired. But that’s probably just from working all day. And… maybe a little heartburn now and then. But I usually just ignore that. It's not constant, you know? Nothing major. Look, I’m a pretty tough guy. I don't bother doctors unless it’s something really bad. Is this going somewhere, Doc? Or are we just going to list every little discomfort I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to dwell on minor issues, Mr. Kristofik, and I appreciate your patience. It's helpful to know about the tiredness and occasional heartburn. Those can sometimes be related. Before we move on, could you tell me a bit about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Seriously? Now we're talking about that? Look, Doc, I’m not comfortable discussing this. It’s personal. Let’s just say…regular. I go to the bathroom. Okay? Is that enough information? I really don’t see how this is going to help me get rid of the bloating. Can we please move on? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable, Mr. Kristofik. I assure you, I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health. It's important to rule out various possibilities. If you're uncomfortable providing specific details, could you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Fine. Look, maybe they’re… a little looser than they used to be. Sometimes. Not always. And… maybe a little more frequent. But honestly, it’s not a big deal. It’s probably just something I ate. I eat a lot of different things. I don't track every single bowel movement, Doc. Is that what you want? A detailed log of my bathroom visits? Can we please get to the part where you tell me what I need to take to make this bloating go away? I'm wasting my whole morning here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like there may have been some changes in your bowel habits recently, with looser and more frequent stools. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Look, I haven't been to a doctor in years. My wife… she took care of all that stuff. I don't remember any medical conditions. I mean, I’m a pile driver operator. It’s hard work, but I'm pretty healthy. I eat, I sleep, I work. I don’t go around getting sick. Honestly, I doubt there's anything to tell you. I’m a pretty simple guy. No fancy illnesses. Is that good enough? I'm not a complicated case, Doc. Really.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kristofik. We can work with that. Let’s move on to any past surgeries you may have had. Have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I’ve broken a few bones here and there on the job, but nothing that required a surgery. Just a few casts over the years. My wife…she always said I was too tough to get seriously hurt. Look, I’m a practical guy. I don’t mess around with doctors and hospitals unless it’s absolutely necessary. And I've managed to avoid them pretty well so far, honestly. Is that what you needed to know? No surgeries. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh. My family... Look, my parents died a long time ago. And I didn’t really pay much attention to their medical stuff. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he smoked a lot. That's about all I remember. We weren’t a close family, honestly. Didn’t really discuss health problems. Is this really going to help me with the bloating, Doc? I'm starting to wonder if I wasted my whole morning coming here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for sharing that. High blood pressure in your mother and smoking in your father are helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a working man, okay? I don’t have time for fancy habits. I don't smoke. Never have. I might have a beer or two with dinner sometimes, on a Friday. Nothing serious. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I’m a pile driver operator. Do I look like someone who uses drugs? Honestly, Doc, this is getting ridiculous. I'm a pretty straightforward guy. No bad habits. Just hard work and a little relaxation on the weekends. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for being honest. So, you have a beer or two with dinner occasionally, but no smoking or recreational drugs. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had one in my life. I eat everything. I'm pretty tough. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. Honestly, Doc, I think I’m a pretty simple case. No allergies, no surgeries, no fancy illnesses. Just…bloating. And frankly, I’m starting to think it’s just something I’m going to have to live with. Can we please get to the part where you tell me what I can take to make it stop? I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. No known allergies. And I understand your frustration. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, my wife handled all this! I take… I think I take a multivitamin sometimes. That's it! Maybe. Honestly, I don’t even remember. And sometimes I take something for heartburn, when it’s really bad. But that’s it. It’s a little blue pill, I think. Honestly, I just grab whatever’s in the cabinet when I need it. I don’t keep track of this stuff. Is this really necessary, Doc? I’m starting to feel like I'm being interrogated. Can we please just wrap this up?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. A multivitamin occasionally and a little blue pill for heartburn when needed. That's helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on what you’ve told me—the ongoing bloating, occasional heartburn, looser stools, and no significant medical history or allergies—it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, possibly triggered by something you’re eating or a change in your gut microbiome. However, we can’t be certain without further investigation. I’d like to start with a few tests to rule out other possibilities, like celiac disease, a bacterial infection or inflammation. I’m going to order a stool sample, a blood test to check for inflammation and celiac antibodies, and potentially a breath test to check for lactose intolerance or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Look, Doc, honestly… I really don’t want to do any tests. I’m a busy man. I just want something to make the bloating stop, not spend my whole life running around getting poked and prodded. Can't you just give me something? Anything? A pill? Something to calm my stomach? I really don’t want to deal with all this. I just want to get back to work. Is there anything you can give me right now, without all the tests? I’m willing to try something, anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution. While tests are the best way to determine the underlying cause and ensure we’re treating you appropriately, I can appreciate that you're hesitant. However, giving you medication without a diagnosis could potentially mask a more serious problem. That being said, to offer some symptomatic relief while we consider the tests, I can prescribe a medication called hyoscyamine. It’s an antispasmodic that can help reduce the cramping and bloating associated with IBS. It’s a relatively mild medication with few side effects, but it's not a long-term solution. I will also recommend you try a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks. I have some informational pamphlets here, and there are many online resources as well. It involves temporarily reducing certain carbohydrates in your diet, which can help calm the gut. Would you be willing to try that combination—the hyoscyamine and the low-FODMAP diet—and then we can discuss the tests if your symptoms don’t improve?
PATIENT: A pill? Okay. A pill sounds good. And a diet… I guess I can try a diet. As long as it’s not too complicated. Look, I’m not a fancy eater. Just give me something to make it stop. A pill and a diet… that’s all I ask. Yes, Doc. That sounds… okay. Anything to get back to normal. Thank you. Just… let’s get this over with. How do I get this pill? And where are these pamphlets?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send the prescription electronically to your pharmacy of choice. It should be ready within a few hours. And here are the pamphlets on the low-FODMAP diet. They explain which foods to avoid and provide some sample meal plans. The pamphlets also have a website listed on them. They're a great resource. I also want to emphasize that if your symptoms worsen—if you experience severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody stools, or significant weight loss—you need to seek immediate medical attention. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss how the medication and diet are working and re-evaluate the need for further testing. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yeah, that sounds fine. As long as I'm feeling better by then. Thank you, Doc. Really, thank you. I appreciate you not making me do a bunch of tests right away. Alright, well, I guess that’s all. I better get going. I’ve got work to do. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kristofik. I’m glad we could come up with a plan. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
