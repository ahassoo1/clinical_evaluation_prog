DOCTOR: Alright, so… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… the lady on the phone said something about… learning? I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. He says I need to… know things. About being healthy, I think. It’s… important to him.
DOCTOR: “Know things.” Right. Well, that’s… vague. Look, I've got a waiting room full of people who actually know why they're here. So, let’s try this: what's been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Oh. Well… my back. It hurts. Always hurts, really. But… worse now, maybe? I do heavy work, you see. Sheet metal. Not easy. It’s… a job.
DOCTOR: Sheet metal, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Very strong metal. Need strong arms. My husband says I lift too much. He always says something. He worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, back pain. How long has it been hurting, generally?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Years, I think. I don't keep track. It comes and goes. Worse when it rains, sometimes. And after a long day at work, definitely worse.
DOCTOR: And what does the pain feel like?
PATIENT: Um… dull. Mostly dull. Like… a weight. Sometimes it sharp, if I bend wrong. But mostly just… there. Heavy and dull. Like I'm carrying a rock.
DOCTOR: Any pain shooting down your leg?
PATIENT: Down my leg? No… not really. Sometimes… a little tingle. In my foot. But not pain. Just… funny feeling. Like it's asleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any trouble with… bladder or bowel control?
PATIENT: Bladder… control? Excuse me? What does that even mean? My husband handles the… things. I don't talk about things like that. Is this… necessary?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s just a standard question. We need to rule things out. Okay, forget I asked. Let’s stick to the back. Any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. I can walk. I can work. I lift things all day. I told you. Maybe… sometimes a little tired at the end of the day. But everyone gets tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Let’s have you lie down on the exam table. I’m going to check your reflexes and see how your back feels when I press on it. Don't tell me if it hurts, I need to know.
PATIENT: Press on my back? And you want me to not say anything? That sounds… strange. I don't like that. What if it hurts a lot?
DOCTOR: Look, it's a medical exam. I need to assess the pain, and I can’t do that if you tell me every little thing that feels uncomfortable. Just try to relax. Now, lie down, please. Face up. I’ll be quick.
PATIENT: Fine. But if it hurts too much, I am telling you. And you’d better be quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just breathe normally. Right here… anything?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! That one. That one hurts. A lot. Stop pressing there. It feels… like a bruise.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And this side?
PATIENT: Don’t press so hard! It’s sensitive. Okay… that’s… not as bad. Just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished. Not alarming, but… not great. Okay. Stand up, slowly. Let’s see how you walk.
PATIENT: I told you I can walk. Just… a little stiff sometimes. It’s the metal. Heavy metal. Always makes me stiff.
DOCTOR: Hmm. You have a slight… antalgic gait. Favoring the right side. Look, it sounds like you’ve got some chronic lower back pain, likely from your job. I’m going to prescribe you some ibuprofen. Take as directed. And… try to lift with your legs, not your back. It’s common sense. .
PATIENT: Ibuprofen? Okay… my husband gives me things sometimes. He knows best. But… is that all? No… stretches? Or something to make it stop hurting forever?
