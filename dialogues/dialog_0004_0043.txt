DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, I’ve got this headache, right here in the back of my head. It’s been bugging me for… oh, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real bother.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. And you're experiencing it in the back of your head. Can you describe the pain for me, Percell?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not a throbbing, like a bad migraine my daughter used to get. More… a dull ache. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head. Sometimes it feels like it's spreading, kinda hard to explain. It doesn’t make me nauseous or anything, and I can still see fine. Just… uncomfortable. It’s worst when I’m trying to concentrate, I think. Like reading or doing my accounts.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache, not throbbing, a tightening sensation. No nausea, no visual disturbances. Worse with concentration. And when you say “accounts,” do you mean you’re actively working on them, or just thinking about them?
PATIENT: Oh, actively working, Doctor. I'm a financial advisor, you see. Still at it, even at my age. Keeps the mind sharp, or so my kids tell me. But lately, even balancing the checkbook's a bit of a struggle with this headache hanging over me. It’s not all the time, mind you. Some days I barely notice it. But then others… it’s just enough to make me a bit grumpy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's impacting your ability to focus at work, which is… concerning. Let’s go through some other things to get a better picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… not really, not that I've noticed. No fever, no dizziness. My appetite's been okay, maybe a little less than usual, but I figured that's just getting older. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been a bit more tired lately. Not like… sick tired, just… worn out. I used to be able to go all day, but now I need a little nap in the afternoon sometimes. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. Fatigue is important. And it’s good you’re thinking about these things. Now, have you had any changes in your vision besides not having any disturbances with the headache itself?
PATIENT: No, no changes to my vision. Still need my glasses, of course, been wearing them for… oh, goodness, almost 60 years now. But not blurrier or anything. Same as always. I get them checked every year, regular as clockwork. Doctor Lee, down on Elm Street, he’s a good man. Last check-up was… let me see… November, I think. Everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. My hands are a bit achy sometimes, you know, arthritis, getting old again. But no weakness, no numbness, not a bit. I still manage my investments just fine, and I do a little gardening when the weather’s good. Knees aren’t what they used to be, but that’s just age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had a bout of pneumonia about fifteen years ago, pretty bad, but recovered fully. High blood pressure for a while, but I got it under control with diet and exercise, mostly. And…oh, yes, I had my gallbladder out when I was in my fifties. Other than that… nothing much, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia fifteen years ago, hypertension controlled with diet and exercise, gallbladder removed. Any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the gallbladder. Had a little trouble with my appendix when I was a boy, but it cleared up on its own. Never needed an operation for it. Now that I think of it, I did have a bad fall a few years back, scraped up my knee pretty good, but no surgery needed for that either. Mostly just bandages and a lot of ice.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. Something called Celebrex. A small dose, keeps the aches at bay. And sometimes I take Tylenol when it’s really bad. Nothing else, I promise. I try to avoid pills whenever possible. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I ran out a while ago and haven’t bothered to get more.
DOCTOR: Celebrex and occasional Tylenol. And no other medications or supplements currently. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. My wife, bless her soul, she was allergic to bee stings, but I never had that problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I haven't got anything to hide. Just let me know if anything feels strange.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. A bit elevated, but not alarming given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Knees have 2+ reflexes bilaterally. Finally, I'm going to check your range of motion. Range of motion appears normal. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Alright, Percell. Everything appears within normal limits on the physical exam, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the most likely cause of your headaches is tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and your work. However, given your age, slightly elevated blood pressure, and the recent onset of fatigue, I want to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood work and an EKG, you say? Alright, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I don’t want to be a bother, you know? Lots of folks needing help, and me just an old man with a headache… When do I need to go for the blood work and EKG? And will I need a referral?
DOCTOR: You're not a bother, Percell, and your health is important. It's my job to investigate these things, regardless of age. We want to ensure everything is working as it should be. I'll write you a referral to LabCorp for the blood work. They have several locations, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. As for the EKG, I’ll have the nurse schedule you an appointment at the cardiology department here at the clinic, next door. It’s a quick, painless procedure. We’ll likely get the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. Try to manage your stress levels as well – perhaps take some short breaks during work, or engage in relaxing activities. If the headaches worsen or you develop any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything pretty thoroughly. Ibuprofen or naproxen, manage stress… I can try. It’s easier said than done sometimes, with all the worries a man carries. But I’ll do my best. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I really appreciate it. And thank you for not dismissing me as just an old man with a headache. I think that’s all for now. Where do I get the referral for the blood work? And who should I ask about scheduling the EKG?
DOCTOR: Here's the referral for LabCorp, with their address and phone number. You can call to schedule an appointment at your convenience. As for the EKG, the nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to discuss scheduling options with you. She's just finishing up with another patient. She'll be able to answer any questions you have about the procedure. Do you have any difficulty walking or would you require a ride to and from the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I can manage just fine, Doctor. Still have my own car, and I drive myself everywhere. Mostly just short trips these days, but I haven't lost my touch yet. No, I don’t need any help with transportation. Thank you for asking though. That's very thoughtful of you. I believe that's everything. I'll wait for the nurse, Maria, then. Thank you again, Doctor Deschane. You've put my mind at ease a bit.
