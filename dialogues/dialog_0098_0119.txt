DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit…awkward to discuss, but I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It's about…a problem my…friend is having. He's a bit embarrassed to come himself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Many patients feel that way. It takes courage to come in, even for someone else. So, your friend is experiencing a medical issue, and you’re here to help him get it addressed. That's very thoughtful of you. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well, he's noticed…a discharge. Yes, a discharge. It's not…normal, I assure you. He's quite clean, usually. He's a respectable man, always has been. It started a few weeks ago, I think. He didn’t mention it at first, but it's gotten…noticeable. And there’s some discomfort, he says, not pain exactly, but…irritation.
DOCTOR: Okay. A discharge, and some irritation…and this has been going on for a few weeks now. Is the discharge…what color is it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. He didn’t exactly give me a detailed report, you understand. I'm not that involved. But I believe he said…yellowish? Perhaps a bit greenish? It’s not bright, thankfully. More…pale. And there isn't a lot of it, just…enough to be concerning. He's usually very particular, so even a small amount is unusual for him.
DOCTOR: Pale yellow or greenish discharge, noticeable because he is typically very clean… Alright. And is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. He did mention an odor. Not…foul, exactly. More…unpleasant. Not something one would notice immediately, but if you were close…it’s there. He described it as…fishy, I believe was the word he used. Honestly, the whole thing is rather delicate.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fishy odor… That's helpful information. Has he experienced any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Well…he's been a little more…tired lately. And a bit more irritable, come to think of it. But he's getting on in years, so one assumes it’s just age. He hasn’t mentioned any burning when he…goes to the bathroom, or any fever, thank goodness. No lumps or bumps, as far as I know. He's quite private, so I haven't been overly inquisitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no burning with urination, no fever, no lumps…increased tiredness and irritability. Has he had any changes in his diet or activity level recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. He keeps to his routine, bless him. Same breakfast every morning, same walk in the park, same television programs in the evening. He's a creature of habit, you see. Very…predictable. He hasn't been travelling, or…meeting new people, if that’s what you’re asking. He’s a widower, mostly keeps to himself.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like his routine hasn't changed. And to clarify, this discharge is coming from…?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, from…down there, Doctor. From his…penis, if you must know. Honestly, it’s terribly awkward to discuss. I only came because he was too embarrassed. It's not something one brings up casually, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I appreciate you doing so on his behalf. It sounds like he may have an infection. The discharge, odor, and irritation are all consistent with that possibility. To be certain, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well…an exam? I suppose if it's necessary. But I must insist it be as discreet as possible. And I’d prefer not to be present during…the more personal aspects, if you understand. He’s a modest man, you see. I’m just here to relay the information.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. His privacy is my utmost concern. I will keep everything as discreet as possible. You are welcome to wait in the waiting room, and I will come and speak with you as soon as I am finished. We can discuss the results and a plan of action then. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be…much preferable. I can’t say I’d be comfortable witnessing any of it. Thank you for understanding. Please, just…do what you need to do to help him. He’s a good man, and this is rather distressing for both of us.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll do everything I can. If you’ll excuse me, I'll prepare for the exam. Please have a seat in the waiting room, and I'll be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness.
