DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s…annoying, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups that have been going on for more than 48 hours. That is quite persistent. Let’s try to figure out what might be going on. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re…normal hiccups, I guess. You know, that little jerk of the chest and a “hic” sound. They come and go, not really a pattern. Sometimes they’re close together, like five in a row, then nothing for a bit. And they don’t really hurt, exactly, but they’re…tiring. I’ve tried holding my breath, like my mother always told me, and drinking water really fast. Nothing seems to work for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so typical hiccups in sensation, no pain, and you’ve already tried some common remedies – holding your breath and drinking water quickly. Good to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I was having lunch with a friend on Sunday when they started, but we were just talking, nothing unusual. I had a soda with my meal…maybe that? But I drink soda sometimes and it doesn’t usually bother me. I did feel a bit stressed last week with getting ready for the summer festival, but that was a week ago now. Honestly, I can’t pinpoint anything specific. They just…started.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear trigger identified. You mentioned some stress last week, but that was a bit ago. And you had a soda with lunch when they started, but that hasn't been consistent. Let's move on to some other questions to get a better picture of what might be happening. Have you had hiccups like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always go away pretty quickly. Usually just a few, and then they’re done. These are…different. They’re just hanging on. It’s really strange. I’m starting to worry a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ivette. Persistent hiccups can be a little worrisome, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Since you've never experienced hiccups lasting this long, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been under control with medication for a while now. Other than that…I'm pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, and I walk a lot. No allergies that I know of. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in…well, a long time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. High blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and no known allergies. Thank you. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think…it’s Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day, every morning. I’ve been on it for about five years now. And I get the prescription filled at the pharmacy down the street. They know me pretty well there. I haven’t changed the dosage recently, everything’s been the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, stable dosage for five years. Good. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, or anything else that might have been going around?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I was a little tired a couple of weeks ago, but I just thought it was the heat. It’s been really warm here lately. But no fever, no cough, no sore throat, nothing that felt like a proper illness. Just…a bit run down, maybe. Nothing that would explain hiccups lasting this long, though. I really don't understand what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illness. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…my mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems. My brother has high cholesterol, but that's about it, I think. Nothing major, nothing that seems relevant to hiccups, really. They weren't a sickly family, overall. We just…lived long lives. Is there something specific you're looking for? I'm trying to think if there was anything unusual, but I'm drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: No, just gathering information. Diabetes and heart problems in the family, and high cholesterol in your brother. Now, let’s move on to some social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It just wasn’t doing me any good. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty simple woman, Doctor. I like my tea and my garden, that’s about it. I'm a volunteer at the summer festival, mostly helping with decorations. Does that count as a hobby?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts as a hobby! Volunteering is wonderful. So, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs, and you’re active with the festival. Let’s just quickly confirm: are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just my Lisinopril for the blood pressure. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I really need them. I try to get by with just the essentials, you know? I'll take a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s about it. And not even regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Lisinopril. Thank you for all of that information, Ivette. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to see if we can get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully you can figure out what's causing these silly hiccups! They’re really starting to wear me out.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also check your abdomen. I’ll also do a quick neurological assessment, just to be thorough. Please lie back on the examination table. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Neurological exam is grossly normal – reflexes are intact, and there's no focal weakness. Everything seems within normal limits on the physical exam. That makes things a little more puzzling. Given the persistence of the hiccups, and the fact that they haven’t responded to simple remedies, we need to consider some further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Puzzling…that’s not what I wanted to hear. What kind of investigation are we talking about? Are you thinking something serious? I just want these hiccups to stop! Is there anything I can do in the meantime? I really appreciate you looking into this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, Ivette. "Puzzling" just means we need to rule things out. Persistent hiccups can be caused by a number of things, some more common than others. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. We can also consider a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything in the lungs that might be irritating the diaphragm. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated. Avoid carbonated beverages and large meals, as these can sometimes worsen hiccups. I can also prescribe Baclofen, a muscle relaxant, to see if that provides some relief. It doesn’t work for everyone, but it’s worth a try. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay, blood tests and a chest X-ray…and the muscle relaxant. Yes, that sounds reasonable. I’d like to try anything to get rid of these, honestly. I’m just tired of them! Carbonated drinks…I do like my soda, but I can cut back. And big meals…well, I do enjoy my food, but I can manage. Baclofen…are there any side effects I should be aware of? And how long will the blood tests take to come back? I hope it’s not too long. I have the festival next week, and I really don’t want to be hiccuping while I’m trying to help with everything. Thank you, Doctor, you've been very helpful so far.
DOCTOR: Baclofen can cause drowsiness and dizziness, so you’ll want to be careful when driving or operating machinery. Some people also experience mild nausea or headache. It’s important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. We’ll monitor you closely for any side effects. The blood tests should come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the results faxed to the clinic, and my nurse will call you as soon as they’re available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and adjust the treatment plan if necessary. I'm going to write a prescription for the Baclofen now, and give you some instructions on how to take it. I’ll also send the orders for the blood tests and chest X-ray to the lab. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before I print the prescription?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. That’s good, right? So, just be careful driving…and watch out for drowsiness. I can manage that. My nurse will call with the results…and we’ll schedule a follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I feel a little better knowing we’re actually doing something about it. Hopefully, this Baclofen works. I'm so ready to get my life back! Are there any warning signs I should look out for that would mean I need to come back sooner? Just in case?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help. It’s good you don't have any known allergies. And yes, absolutely. If you experience any difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Also, if the hiccups worsen despite taking the Baclofen, or if you develop a fever, you should contact me right away. Those are unlikely, but it's always best to be cautious. Here are the instructions for the Baclofen, and the lab order for the tests and X-ray. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with the clinic in one week so we can review your results. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Bacy. You’ve been wonderful. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment right away and try to stay positive. Hopefully, this will finally put an end to these silly hiccups! Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I hope the Baclofen provides some relief, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy the festival preparations – hiccups or no hiccups! .
