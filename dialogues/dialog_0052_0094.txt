DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… good morning. I… think it’s just… the paper said something about learning? My husband, he filled out all the forms. I don't really remember why I'm here, to be honest. Just… learning things, I guess. Is that right?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Sometimes the paperwork can be a little confusing. It appears this appointment was scheduled as part of a preventative health education program. However, we always want to ensure we address your concerns first and foremost. So, putting that aside for a moment, is there anything specific you've been experiencing – any symptoms, discomfort, or changes in your health – that you'd like to discuss with me today?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… I work with metal, you know? Sheet metal. It’s… dusty. And loud. My ears ring sometimes. But I think everyone’s ears ring when they work with loud things, right? And my back… it gets sore. But again, metal is heavy. I don’t know… is that something I need to talk about? It just feels… old. Like an old back.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fontanazza, those things absolutely warrant discussion. The ringing in your ears – that's called tinnitus – and the back soreness are important for us to investigate, especially given your occupation. It’s good you mentioned both. Let's start with the tinnitus. How long has your hearing been ringing?
PATIENT: Ringing… a long time, I think. Years? It comes and goes. When it's quiet, I notice it more. Like… now, when we're talking and it's not so loud with the machines. It’s not always ringing, you know? Sometimes I don’t even notice it. Is it… bad? Should I be worried? My husband says I should get it checked, but… he worries about everything.
DOCTOR: It's good your husband is attentive to your health, Ms. Fontanazza. While tinnitus can be bothersome, it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. However, because you work with metal and have been exposed to loud noises for years, it’s important to assess your hearing and rule out any potential damage. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a brief hearing test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A test? Okay… I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have things to do, you know? Work doesn't just… stop because I’m here. And my husband needs dinner when I get home. Is it… painful? I don’t like things that are painful.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fontanazza, it's not painful at all. It’s a very simple test. You'll be wearing headphones, and you’ll hear a series of tones at different volumes. You simply indicate when you can hear the tone. It will take about fifteen to twenty minutes. We have a soundproof booth right over here. Before we do that, though, let's talk about your back pain. You mentioned it feels “old.” Could you describe the pain in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… okay. That’s… manageable. The back… it’s like… a dull ache. Most of the time. After a long day, it’s… worse. Like someone’s been hitting it with a hammer. Not really a hammer, but… that’s the closest I can explain. It’s lower back, mostly. And sometimes it goes down my leg. Not all the way, just… a little. I take some pills. My husband buys them. I don’t remember what they’re called. They help a little.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fontanazza. That’s helpful. Pain radiating down your leg is something we need to pay attention to. And it’s important for me to know exactly what medication you're taking, even if you don't recall the name. Could you perhaps bring the bottle with you when you come back for a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: A follow-up? Oh. I… didn't think there would be a follow-up. I just thought I was coming to… learn. My husband… he makes all these appointments. He worries a lot. I’ll ask him about the pills. He keeps them. I don't really handle… that stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It's common for one family member to manage medications. We can certainly work around that. Before we proceed with the hearing test, let's quickly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… diabetes? No, I don’t think so. My husband always makes sure I eat healthy, though. He’s very strict about sweets. High blood pressure… I don’t know. I go to the doctor sometimes, but I don’t really… pay attention to what they say. Arthritis… my grandmother had that. It was her hands. Mine aren't so bad. Just… old, like my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like you haven’t been formally diagnosed with those conditions. And it’s good to hear your husband supports a healthy lifestyle. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had surgery. I don’t like hospitals. They smell… funny. And the people are always… sick. I’ve been to the emergency room once, a long time ago. I fell and broke my wrist. But that was… when I was young. Not this old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no surgeries, and one emergency room visit for a broken wrist many years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pills for your back pain that we haven't identified the name of yet?
PATIENT: Just… the back pills. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take something for that. My husband buys it too. It makes me… drowsy. I don't remember what it's called either. He keeps all the bottles. He says it's important to keep track. I just… want to sleep. It's hard to sleep sometimes with the ringing in my ears.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is very diligent about managing your medications, and it’s helpful that you’re telling me about this, even if you don't know the specific names. Finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband makes me try new things all the time. He says it’s important to have a balanced diet. I think I had a rash once, when I was a little girl. But it wasn’t from anything I ate. It was… from poison ivy, I think. We were playing outside.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. No known allergies to medications or food, and a childhood exposure to poison ivy. Now, before we proceed with the hearing test, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… oh. Is that… going to be uncomfortable? I don’t like people touching me. Especially my back. It’s… sensitive. My husband says I’m too sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. I will be as gentle as possible. The exam is very quick, and I will explain everything I’m doing before I do it. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly feel your back to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. We can start with your blood pressure. It's just a cuff around your arm, and it doesn’t hurt at all. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A cuff… okay. Just around my arm. That sounds… alright. As long as you’re gentle. My husband says I have… thin skin. That’s why I bruise easily. He always worries when I get a little bump.
DOCTOR: I will be very careful, Ms. Fontanazza. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. We can monitor it at future appointments. Now, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope?
PATIENT: Okay… the heart and lungs. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please… be gentle. I don't like feeling… poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. This is just to listen for any unusual sounds. Your heart sounds regular. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, I'm going to briefly examine your back. I’ll just feel along your spine and muscles to check for any tenderness. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain. There’s some muscle tension in your lower back, and it’s tender to the touch. Nothing alarming, but it's consistent with your report of pain. Do you feel any sharp pain or radiating sensations when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that… that hurts a little. Right there. And a little bit down my leg. Not all the way, just… a tingling. Like pins and needles. It happens sometimes when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. That tingling sensation radiating down your leg is something we need to investigate further. It suggests possible irritation of a nerve. Based on your symptoms and the brief examination, it's likely you have a muscle strain in your lower back with possible nerve involvement. However, to rule out any other causes and get a clearer diagnosis, I recommend an X-ray of your lower back. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh. Is that… safe? I heard something about… radiation. And I don’t like being around those machines. They make funny noises. My husband said something about… not too many of those.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Fontanazza. You're right to be concerned about radiation. The amount of radiation from a single X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. We use the lowest possible dose to get a clear image. It will help us rule out any fractures or other structural problems that could be causing your pain. We will ensure you're properly shielded to minimize exposure. And the procedure itself is quick – it only takes a few minutes. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… minutes? Okay. A few minutes… That’s… manageable, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. But what will it show? If it shows something bad, I don’t want to know. My husband always tells me not to worry about things I can’t fix.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair concern, Ms. Fontanazza. The X-ray will allow us to visualize the bones in your lower back and identify any abnormalities like fractures, arthritis, or narrowing of the spaces between the vertebrae. If everything appears normal, that will reassure us and allow us to focus on managing the muscle strain with physical therapy and other treatments. If we do find something, we'll discuss it thoroughly with you and your husband, and explain all your options for treatment. You're not alone in this, and we'll help you make the best decision for your health. Would you like me to order the X-ray now?
PATIENT: Okay… Order it. But tell the person doing it to be… gentle. And quick. Please. And don’t tell me anything bad. Let my husband handle it. He worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I will make a note to ensure the technician is gentle and quick, and I will communicate with your husband directly regarding the results. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and applying heat or ice to your lower back. Do you have any questions about those recommendations?
PATIENT: Heat or… ice? Which one? My husband says something about… swelling. But I don't feel any swelling. It just… aches. Is heat better for aches? Or ice? I always get those two mixed up. He tells me, but I forget.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Fontanazza. Generally, heat is better for muscle aches and stiffness, while ice is more effective for acute injuries and swelling. Since you're experiencing an ache and not significant swelling, I recommend starting with heat. You can use a heating pad or a warm bath for 15-20 minutes at a time. If you find that the heat doesn’t provide much relief, you can try ice instead. Alternating between heat and ice can also be helpful. Do you have any other questions about managing your pain, or would you like me to write down these recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Write them down, please. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Especially when I’m tired. And my husband will want to see it too. He keeps track of everything. He's very organized.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Fontanazza. It summarizes the recommendations for managing your lower back pain, including the use of heat or ice, and the importance of over-the-counter pain relievers. We’ve also ordered an X-ray of your lower back. We’ll contact you with the results as soon as they’re available, and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Please… tell my husband. He'll know what to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I will certainly communicate directly with your husband regarding the results and any further recommendations. If you experience any worsening pain, difficulty walking, or any numbness or tingling in your legs, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
