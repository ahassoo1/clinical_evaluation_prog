DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it's this…feeling full awful quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what it is, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. That sounds uncomfortable. So, it’s a feeling of fullness very quickly when you eat, regardless of what you're eating, and it's been going on for about a month now. Can you tell me a bit more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not pain, exactly. More like…pressure, I guess. Right here, under my ribs. And it's not a huge amount of food that does it, you know? Just a normal-sized plate, even. It used to be I could finish a good meal, but now… I just can’t. It feels like something's blocking me, almost.
DOCTOR: Right, pressure under your ribs, even with a normal-sized plate of food, and it's making it difficult to finish your meals. That sensation of something blocking you is good to know. Is that pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worst during eating, like I said. After, it kinda fades, but it's still there a bit, like a dull ache. Not all the time, though. Sometimes I don't notice it at all. It’s just… unpredictable, I suppose. It's been making it hard to enjoy my food, and my wife makes such good salmon!
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when something interferes with enjoying a good meal, especially when your wife is a good cook! So, it's intermittent pressure, worse during and shortly after eating, fading to a dull ache at times. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – things like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, changes in your bowel movements, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No vomiting, no. A little heartburn sometimes, but I get that anyway, being older, you know? Bowel movements seem normal enough… regular as clockwork, thankfully. And… no, I haven’t lost any weight, not that I’ve noticed. My wife keeps a close eye on things, and she'd definitely say something if I was. She's a worrywart, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the regular bowel movements and no weight loss. And it’s helpful you mention the occasional heartburn – we’ll keep that in mind. Now, just to get a clearer picture, have you tried anything to manage this feeling yourself – things like eating smaller meals, avoiding certain foods, or taking any over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Well, I've been trying to eat slower, that's for sure. And smaller portions, like you said. Doesn't seem to make a huge difference, honestly. I stopped having a big plate of bannock with my dinner, figured maybe it was just too much at once. Didn't help much either. As for medications… no, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Always worried about side effects, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medications. It’s good you’ve already tried slowing down and reducing portion sizes. Now, I’d like to ask a bit about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or stomach ulcers?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Let's see… No diabetes, thankfully. My mother had that, so I'm always careful with sweets. Heart… I had a bit of a flutter a few years back, the doctor said it was nothing serious, just age. Some irregular heartbeat, he gave me some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to be doing much good and I didn’t like the way they made me feel. Stomach ulcers… no, never been diagnosed with those. I’ve had a bit of indigestion over the years, but nothing major. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, maybe… thirty years ago now?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No diabetes, a past history of a heart flutter, no ulcers, and gallbladder removal thirty years ago. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the occasional aspirin if I get a bad headache, but that’s it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible, like I said. I prefer to just… tough it out, mostly. Old habits, I guess. My wife keeps trying to get me to take something for my joints, but I refuse.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach cancer, pancreatic problems, or gallbladder disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had that diabetes, like I said. And her sister… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. My father… he was a healthy man, lived a long life. Nothing major that I can remember. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had some kind of stomach trouble, but I don’t know what it was. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about those things much back then. We didn’t have doctors as often as folks do these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. History of diabetes and heart problems on your mother’s side, and some unspecified stomach trouble in your grandmother. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, exactly? Are you asking about… my hobbies? I like to carve, mostly. Been doing that my whole life. And spending time with my grandchildren, when I can.
DOCTOR: No, not hobbies exactly. I'm just asking about things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or have a history of working with any potentially harmful substances. Also, about your diet – beyond just mentioning your wife’s salmon, anything else you eat regularly or avoid?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, of course. No, never smoked a day in my life. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him. No, thank you. I have a little bit of whiskey sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular, just a wee dram now and then. As for diet… well, my wife does most of the cooking. We eat a lot of fish, salmon especially, like I said. Lots of vegetables, too. She makes a good stew. I try to avoid too much sugar, but I have a sweet tooth, I confess. Bannock is my weakness, even though it seems to bother my stomach. And I like a good cup of tea with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No smoking, occasional whiskey, a diet rich in fish and vegetables, with a fondness for bannock. Alright, Norval, thank you for that information. It gives me a good understanding of your history. Based on what you've told me, the pressure under your ribs, the early fullness, and the intermittent nature of the symptoms, it could be a few different things. It could be related to your gallbladder, even after having it removed thirty years ago, although that’s less common. It could also be something related to your stomach or duodenum, or even something a bit more general like irritable bowel syndrome. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and gently feel around to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness or discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. I've been feeling a bit run-down lately, maybe that's all it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Okay… I’m not detecting any significant tenderness to the touch, but there is a mild fullness in the upper abdomen. Your bowel sounds are present, but a bit diminished. No obvious signs of acute inflammation. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Your respiratory rate is 16. Based on the exam, it doesn't seem to be anything acutely concerning, but the diminished bowel sounds and fullness warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. I'm also going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this, so I can enjoy my wife's cooking again! An ultrasound, you say? Will it… hurt? I've never had one before.
DOCTOR: No, an ultrasound shouldn't hurt at all. It uses sound waves to create an image of the organs inside your abdomen. It’s completely non-invasive. A technician will apply a gel to your skin, and then move a wand over your abdomen. It might feel a little cold, but it shouldn’t be painful. The technician will likely ask you to lie on your back and potentially your side during the procedure. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding foods that seem to trigger your symptoms. I'll write up the requisitions for the blood work and ultrasound now. The clinic staff will schedule you for the ultrasound and let you know when to come in. I'll give you a copy of the requisitions, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. That all sounds… manageable. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing it as just old age. When should I expect to hear about the results? A week or so?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Norval. It's important to investigate these things, regardless of age. The lab results should be back within a couple of days. The ultrasound might take a bit longer, perhaps a week or so, as they need to book an appointment and the radiologist needs to review the images. The clinic will contact you as soon as everything is available. If you haven’t heard anything after a week and a half, please give the clinic a call, and we’ll check on the status of the results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are the requisitions, and a summary of the instructions we discussed. Do you have any difficulty understanding any of this?
PATIENT: No, I understand everything perfectly, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I'll keep an eye on things and contact the clinic if anything changes. I suppose I'll be going home now, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. You're very welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your time at home. We’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you for everything. Goodbye.
