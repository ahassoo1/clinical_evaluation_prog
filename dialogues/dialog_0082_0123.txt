DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started, oh, I don’t know, maybe a month or so ago? It’s all over, arms, legs, back… everywhere, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin… that can be quite bothersome. A month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It comes and goes, but when it comes, oh boy. It’s not painful, just… intensely itchy. I’ve tried lotions, you know, the regular kinds, but they don’t really do much good. It just… keeps happening. Sometimes worse at night, I think.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Worse at night, that's good to know. And you said lotions haven't been helping much. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I haven't really tried to figure it out, to be honest. It just… is. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, no new soaps or detergents, nothing like that. Maybe when I get warm? I live in Puerto Rico, so it’s warm a lot! But I can’t say for sure. It just feels random, really. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Cassimatis. Random itching can be tricky to pinpoint. It's good you've already considered new soaps and detergents. Let's try to get a better picture of this. Have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itch?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Well, it looks normal, I guess. Not red, no bumps or anything. Just… dry-ish? I mean, I’m older, so my skin is always a little on the dry side. It doesn’t look bad, that’s for sure. It just feels awful. I haven't noticed any… scaling or anything like that, no. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, no visible rash, bumps, redness, or scaling – just dryness and intense itch. Alright. And have you had anything like this happen before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I think maybe when I was younger. A long time ago! But I don’t really remember the details. It wasn’t as bad as this, I don’t think. And it went away on its own, I believe. It was so many years ago… honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm sorry if I'm not very helpful!
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Cassimatis. Memories can be… elusive. No need to apologize at all. We’ll figure this out together. Now, just to cover all the bases, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little something for my blood pressure, a very small dose. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. That's about it, really. Nothing else regularly. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a little low last year.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: You know, I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I eat everything, pretty much. I used to be allergic to bees when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago and I haven’t been stung in years! I don't think I have any allergies now, no. Maybe a little bit sensitive to the sun, but everyone in Puerto Rico is!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, just a little sun sensitivity. Good to know. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick examination of your skin. Have you had any recent travel outside of Puerto Rico?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not recently. I haven’t left the island in, oh, maybe five years? I used to travel a lot more when my husband was alive, but… well, that was a long time ago. No, I’ve been here in Puerto Rico the whole time. Mostly just around town, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. That's very helpful. And one last thing, before the exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had… well, she had high blood pressure, like me. And my father had diabetes. And arthritis, actually, both of them did. I think my grandmother had something with her skin, but I don't really remember what. Something… itchy, maybe? It was so long ago, and no one really talked about these things much back then. I don't think anyone in my family had anything serious with their skin, though. Just the usual aches and pains, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis, with a vague recollection of a skin condition in your grandmother. Thank you, Ms. Cassimatis. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to take a look at your skin. If you could just sit back on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll just need to examine the areas where you’ve been experiencing the itch.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Here, you can look wherever you need to. It’s all over, like I said, but especially on my arms and back. Let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m just going to gently feel your skin, and visually inspect the areas you’ve described. Tell me if anything is particularly tender or uncomfortable. Hmm. The skin appears generally normal in color and texture. No obvious rash, lesions, or signs of infection. There is some mild dryness, as you mentioned, but nothing particularly remarkable. It’s difficult to say much without further investigation, but based on what I see, it doesn't appear to be anything acutely concerning. “Skin examination reveals mild dryness, no visible rash, lesions, or signs of acute inflammation.”
PATIENT: Well, that’s… good to hear, I suppose. But what is it, Doctor? It’s driving me crazy! Is it something I need to worry about? Is it my age? Could it be something with my blood pressure medicine? I’m just so uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s good that we haven’t found anything alarming on the skin itself. The itching you’re experiencing could be due to a number of factors. Dry skin, as we’ve discussed, is a common cause, especially with age. However, since lotions haven’t provided relief, we need to explore other possibilities. It’s possible that the Lisinopril could be a contributing factor, although it’s not a common side effect. Itching can sometimes occur with certain medications, but it’s not always directly linked. We can certainly consider other blood pressure medications if needed, but let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Other possibilities include mild allergic reaction to something environmental, or even a nerve-related issue. Given your age and overall health, we should also rule out any underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. A complete blood count will help us look for any signs of infection or inflammation. A comprehensive metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function. And we’ll also check your thyroid levels, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause itching. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Anything to figure this out. I just want some relief. Thyroid… my sister had trouble with her thyroid, I think. And my kidneys… are those okay? My blood pressure isn't too high, is it? I worry about all these things, you know. So, blood tests, then what? Will I have to see a specialist?
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s good we’re being thorough. Your kidneys and thyroid are important things to check, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. The blood tests will give us a good starting point. We’ll check your kidney function to make sure everything is working properly, and your thyroid levels to rule out any imbalances. I will also check a Vitamin D level, as low levels can also cause itching. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them carefully and discuss the next steps with you. If the blood tests don’t reveal a clear cause, or if your symptoms persist, we may need to consider a referral to a dermatologist. A dermatologist specializes in skin conditions and can perform more specialized tests, such as a skin biopsy, if needed. But let’s not worry about that just yet. Let’s start with the blood tests and see what they tell us. Do you have any questions about the blood tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… where will I go to get them done? Do I need to fast beforehand? And how will I get the results? Will you call me? I’m not very good with all these… procedures, you know. My husband always took care of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Cassimatis. I understand. It can be overwhelming. You’ll go to the lab here at the clinic, just down the hall. You do need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – meaning no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water, though. We’ll give you a requisition form to take with you. Once the results are back, my nurse, Maria, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I will review the results with you then, and we can discuss the best course of action. I will also put a note in your chart to remind Maria to contact you promptly. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s the requisition form. And I’ll have Maria print out some instructions on fasting for you as well. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’ll go to the lab now, then. And wait for Maria to call. Hopefully, we’ll find out what’s wrong soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. And hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. Maria is excellent, she'll take good care of you. Take care, and I’ll see you when we have the results back.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
