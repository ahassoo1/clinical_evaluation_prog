DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think. Just what the nurse scheduled me for. Something about staying up to date, she said. I’m not entirely sure which one, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let me just double-check here… Yes, it looks like you're scheduled for your updated COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations today. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. COVID and the flu… both, okay. I think I remember something about needing to get both this year. Is there a big difference between the shots? I don’t mind getting them, I just like to understand what I’m doing, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand wanting to know what you’re receiving. That’s a very good question. Both vaccines protect against respiratory viruses, but they target different ones, of course. The COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against the different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while the flu vaccine protects against influenza viruses. The formulations change yearly to match the most prevalent strains circulating. Are you familiar with how often the flu vaccine needs to be updated?
PATIENT: Hmm, I think I’ve heard something about that… that it changes every year because the flu virus is always… changing itself? It’s a bit confusing, to be honest. I usually just let the nurse do her thing, but this year I thought I’d ask a few questions. I like to be informed. Is it important to get both every year, then? Even if I felt okay last year?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. The flu virus does mutate quickly, so the vaccine is reformulated annually to target the strains most likely to be circulating. And yes, it's important to get both updated every year, even if you felt fine last year. The viruses evolve, and your immunity from a previous vaccine or infection decreases over time. Getting both vaccines provides the best protection against illness. Have you had a flu shot in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I’ve been trying to keep up with everything… the nurse at my old job was really good about reminding everyone. I think I got one last year, but honestly, 2024 was a bit of a blur. I remember feeling a little achy afterwards, but nothing terrible. I didn’t get the flu, so I guess it worked! Will these shots feel the same?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve received them in the past! It sounds like you had a typical reaction – a little achiness is common as your body builds immunity. These updated vaccines are formulated similarly, so you can expect a similar experience. Some people report mild side effects like soreness at the injection site, fatigue, or a low-grade fever, but they usually resolve within a day or two. Are you allergic to any medications or have you had a severe reaction to any vaccines in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No allergies that I know of. And I've never had a bad reaction to a shot before, never. Just a little bit of soreness, like you said. I'm a pretty healthy guy, all things considered. Do I need to do anything special after I get them? Like, take it easy or something? I have a bit of gardening planned for this weekend.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know. It sounds like you have a good history. No, you don’t need to do anything special, but it’s always a good idea to take it easy for the rest of the day, especially after getting two vaccinations at once. Gardening is fine, but perhaps avoid strenuous activity for the next 24 hours. Staying well-hydrated is also helpful. Now, before we proceed with the vaccinations, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood pressure and a listen… no problem at all. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Let’s get this over with, then! I have those tomatoes waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay, everything sounds good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but within a normal range, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, we can proceed with the vaccinations. I'll administer them in your left arm. You might feel a slight pinch. Let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. A little pinch is fine. I’ve had worse. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It really puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. That’s the COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine. Just relax your arm for a few minutes. Are you feeling okay?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A little pinch, just like you said. Nothing terrible. My arm feels a little… warm, maybe? But that’s probably normal. It doesn't hurt to move it, does it? I'm not feeling dizzy or anything. It's all good so far.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. A little warmth and mild soreness are completely normal reactions. Palpating the injection sites, there is mild tenderness, but no swelling or redness. It's good that you don’t have any dizziness. To be on the safe side, I’d like you to remain here for about 15 minutes so we can observe you for any delayed reactions. If you experience anything unusual – like difficulty breathing, hives, or severe swelling – please let me know immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fifteen minutes is fine. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s good to know someone is looking out for me. Hopefully, this will keep those tomatoes safe!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguiо. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could help. It’s always a pleasure to see patients taking proactive steps to protect their health. And I certainly hope it does keep those tomatoes safe! We’ll just keep an eye on you for the next 15 minutes. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if anything changes. In the meantime, I’ll document everything in your chart. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been wonderful. I think I'm all good here. Fifteen minutes sounds perfect. I'm just enjoying the quiet for a moment. Hopefully I won't feel too achy tomorrow!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It's good you're feeling alright. Most people experience only mild side effects, if any. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just relax, and let me know if anything changes. So, do you have any plans for the weekend besides tending to those tomatoes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Besides the tomatoes, I'm hoping to finish reading that new book I started – a mystery, you know? And maybe do a little bit of gardening with my neighbor, Mrs. Silva. She always has the best tips. Nothing too exciting, but it’s a nice, quiet life. I prefer it that way, really. It's nice to have things to look forward to, isn't it? What about you, Doctor? Do you have any fun plans?
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Paguiо. A good book and good company – that's a perfect weekend. I'm hoping to spend some time with my family – we're planning a picnic in the park, if the weather cooperates. Oh, it looks like our 15 minutes are up! How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel fine. No dizziness, no weird reactions. My arm feels a little tender, but that’s it, really. I think I'm good to go. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguiо. I'm glad I could help. If you do experience any unusual symptoms in the next few days, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a pamphlet with some information about common vaccine side effects and what to do if you’re concerned. Enjoy your weekend with your tomatoes and your neighbor! And thank you for coming in today. .
