DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you also. I am here because… how you say… liquid is coming from my ear. It has been happening for maybe three days now, I think. Not a lot, but enough to be… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, liquid coming from your ear for about three days. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a bit more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellowish. Not blood, I do not think. And it does not hurt hurt, but feels… full. Like pressure. I try to clean it, with a cloth, but it keeps coming.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear or slightly yellowish discharge with a feeling of fullness and pressure. No significant pain, but you've noticed it keeps coming back even with cleaning. Do you notice any hearing changes, like muffled sounds, or ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you are very… thorough. I do notice things are not as clear. Like when people speak, I have to ask them to repeat. Especially my daughter. She speaks very quickly. And… yes, a little ringing. Not all the time, but when it is quiet. Like now, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some hearing difficulty, especially with softer sounds or quicker speech, and some ringing in your ear – we call that tinnitus. Has this happened before, or is this the first time you've experienced this?
PATIENT: This is… new. Never before this. I have had colds, many times, of course. And sometimes my ears feel blocked then, but this liquid… no. Never liquid before. Perhaps two years ago, I had a very bad cold, and my ear felt… stuffed. But not like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is a new symptom, distinct from previous ear stuffiness with colds. Do you have any other symptoms associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. No fever. No headache. No pain in my jaw or teeth. I feel… tired, but I am always a little tired. That is just… age, I think. I eat normally, sleep normally. Just the ear. It is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms like fever, headache, or jaw pain, and you're attributing the fatigue to age, which is understandable. It is good that you're getting it checked out. Let's do a quick examination of your ear. Would you mind sitting up and tilting your head to the side so I can take a look?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I will do as you say. Please, tell me if you need me to do anything else. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm looking now. I do see some discharge in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears slightly cloudy. There’s a bit of redness as well. It doesn't look like a ruptured eardrum, but there is some inflammation. I'm going to gently inflate a little air into the ear to see how the eardrum moves. It's a little less movement than I'd like to see. It could be due to the fluid. Based on what you've told me and what I see, it's likely you have an outer ear infection, also called otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, although you don't necessarily need to be a swimmer to get it. The redness and fluid are consistent with that. The decreased eardrum mobility also fits. It’s good we caught it early. Do you have any allergies to ear drops, or any other medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I have taken many medicines in my life, never a problem. And I do not… “catch” things easily. I have a strong constitution. Swimmer’s ear? I do not swim. But I do wash my face, every day, with warm water. Perhaps water got inside? I do not know. What will you do to fix it? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that’s good to know. And you're right, you don't need to be a swimmer to get it—any moisture can potentially cause it. Water getting into the ear canal is a common cause. I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops, a topical antibiotic and steroid combination. This will help to fight the infection and reduce the inflammation. It might sting a little when you first put it in, but it shouldn’t be painful. It's important to keep your ear dry while you're using the drops—avoid getting water in your ear. I'll also give you some instructions on how to apply the drops correctly. I want you to use the drops twice a day for seven days. If it doesn’t improve after that, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, severe pain, or dizziness, please let me know right away. Would you like me to explain how to properly administer the ear drops?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I would like very much to know how to put the drops in correctly. I do not want to make it worse. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help very much. It is… reassuring to know what is wrong.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could reassure you. Okay, so you’ll want to gently pull your ear upwards and backwards—like you’re trying to straighten the ear canal. This helps to open it up. Then, hold the ear drop bottle and gently squeeze a few drops into your ear canal. You don’t need to fill it up, just a few drops is enough. After you put the drops in, stay on your side for about five minutes to let the medication soak in. It's helpful to warm the ear drops slightly by holding the bottle in your hand for a few minutes before you use them. This can make it more comfortable. And remember, keep your head tilted to the side for those five minutes. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is very clear. Pull up and back, warm the bottle, stay on my side for five minutes. I think I can remember that. And stay dry. Is it okay to… clean the outside of my ear with a cloth? Just the part you can see? I do not want to push anything inside.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Pull up and back, warm the bottle, stay on your side, and keep it dry. You are remembering everything. And yes, it's perfectly fine to gently clean the outside of your ear with a cloth. Just don’t insert anything into the ear canal – you're right to be cautious about that. Trying to clean inside can actually push bacteria further in and make things worse. I’m going to print out these instructions for you to take home, along with the prescription for the ear drops. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check on your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that is very good. Instructions and a follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very kind and helpful. One week sounds perfect. I will… try my best to keep the water out. Is there anything else I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm happy to help. Just one more thing – if you experience any dizziness, hearing loss, or drainage that looks like pus—meaning thick, yellow or green discharge—please contact the clinic immediately, even before your follow-up appointment. Otherwise, follow the instructions, keep it dry, and hopefully, you'll be feeling much better soon. I'll have the nurse come in to give you the prescription and schedule your follow-up. Do you have any questions for me before I let her in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have answered all my questions. I am very grateful for your time and help. Tell the nurse I will be ready for the prescription and follow-up. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'm glad I could help. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. Have a good day, Mr. Radillo, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
