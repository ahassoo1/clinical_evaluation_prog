DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… well, they told me I gotta get checked out. Something about… a team? A sports team? I forget what it was for, honestly. My ex-wife signed me up for something. She always liked me active, even when I didn't. It’s for… physical, right? They said physical. I need a paper, I think. For the… team.
DOCTOR: Right. A team. Yes. Well, let’s try to get some clarity, shall we?
PATIENT: Clarity? You want me to be clear? That’s… a bit much, don’t you think? I told you, I don’t remember much. It was something she… insisted on. A lot of running, maybe? Or throwing? Something with a ball, I think. Honestly, these things just… happen. I show up, they tell me what to do. It’s usually a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Let’s start with you. What’s bothering you physically?
PATIENT: Physically? Well… my knees. Always my knees. Old construction work, you know? Lots of bending, lots of heavy stuff. They ache. And sometimes my back, when it’s cold. But that’s just… getting old. Everyone gets old. Not much you can do about it, really. I take some pills sometimes, but they don't do much good. What kind of pills… hmm. I forget the name. A little white one. Or maybe it was blue. I dunno.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… I have you down for some previous issues with osteoarthritis in both knees, and a history of lower back pain. And… nothing listed for current medications. Are you sure you’re not taking anything regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? No, not… regularly. Maybe sometimes. When it really hurts. My neighbor, old man Henderson, gave me some. He gets his from… somewhere. They help a little, but I don’t like taking things. Makes me feel… fuzzy. It’s probably just aspirin, or something. I don’t bother the doctor with little things. He’s got important people to see, you know? Not some aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, taking medication – especially medication from a neighbor – without a doctor’s knowledge is… unwise. We need to know what you're putting into your system. It can interact with other conditions, cause complications. Now, can you describe the pain in your knees?
PATIENT: Complications? Oh, for goodness sake. Henderson’s been taking those pills for years! He's fine. Always out mowing his lawn, that man. Fine as a fiddle. The knees… well, it’s a dull ache, mostly. Gets worse when I walk a lot. Or when it's damp. Like today, actually. Feels… stiff. Like they’re full of gravel. And sometimes, if I bend them too far, it’s a sharp pain. But it goes away. Usually. It’s just old age, I tell ya. Old age and bad weather. What do you want me to do? Draw you a picture?
DOCTOR: I want you to be honest with me, Mr. Bartok. And I need you to understand that "just old age" isn't a diagnosis. We need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. A physical exam. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Honestly, doctors these days... There. Happy now? Be careful, though. These knees ain’t what they used to be. And don’t expect me to do any jumping jacks. I’m not a spring chicken, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… There’s some crepitus with flexion and extension. And tenderness along the medial joint line of both knees. Range of motion is limited, particularly with full extension. Do you experience any locking or giving way?
PATIENT: Cre… what now? Look, I don't speak doctor talk. You're touching my knees and asking me questions I can't answer. Locking? Like a door? Giving way? Like… I fall down? No! I don’t fall down! Not usually. Sometimes I stumble, but that’s just… balance. Old age, remember? It's all balance. And these knees creaking… well, everything creaks when you get old. The house creaks, I creak, the dog creaks… It's a fact of life. Honestly, what are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I am trying to assess the extent of your knee pain and determine the best course of action. It sounds like you likely have significant osteoarthritis, but we need to rule out other potential issues. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… sometimes. After I've been walking a lot. Or when it's really damp. They feel… puffy. Not like balloons, but… bigger. They definitely feel bigger than usual. But it goes away. Usually after I sit down and put my feet up. It's just… water, I guess. Old age and water. Everything's connected, you know? Honestly, Doctor, are you going to give me a pill or what? My knees are aching just standing here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history, the exam findings, and your description of the symptoms, it does appear you are experiencing a flare-up of osteoarthritis in both knees. However, I would like to order some X-rays to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other underlying issues. Also, we need to discuss pain management options. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from eating too much pizza. My ex-wife always said I ate too much pizza. She was always right about something, that woman. X-rays, huh? Will that take long? I got things to do, you know. Not important things, but... things. And pain management... like pills? I told you, I don't like taking pills. But... if it's the only way, I guess. What kind of pills are we talking about? Little ones? Big ones? Because I have trouble swallowing big ones. Honestly, all this is a lot of fuss over a couple of aching knees.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, the X-rays will take about fifteen minutes. And we have options besides pills. Physical therapy, injections… we can discuss those as well. But first, let's get the X-rays to have a clear picture of what’s going on. I'll have the technician come in and take some images. In the meantime, let’s go over your past medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… hmm… yes! I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree, trying to impress a girl. She wasn't impressed. They put a cast on it. A big, white cast. It was itchy. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. No fancy operations. Just a broken arm, a long time ago. And a cast that itched. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of time. I just want to know if I can go home now. My knees are killing me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Broken arm as a child. Good. Any hospitalizations other than for the broken arm?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations? No. Never been one for hospitals. Too many sick people. And bad TV. I got a cold once, real bad. My ex-wife made me stay in bed for a week. She was always fussing over me when I was sick. Even though I hated it. Just a cold, though. No hospital. I prefer to tough things out, myself. Honestly, Doctor, are we almost done here? I’m starting to feel… faint. Probably just the knees. And all this talking.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I need you to focus. This is important. Have you ever had any serious illnesses, like heart problems, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? Oh, goodness. Let me see… My aunt had something. A bad cough, I think. But that wasn't me! Me? No. I eat pretty good. Pizza, mostly. And sometimes hot dogs. My blood pressure's a little high, the doctor told me once. But that’s just from getting excited watching baseball. I don't have any of those fancy illnesses you’re talking about. Heart problems… diabetes… no, no, none of that. I'm a pretty healthy guy, all things considered. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m starting to get a headache. And my knees are throbbing. Can we just get the X-rays done already?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Fine. The technician will be in shortly to take the X-rays. After that, we’ll discuss a plan. But I need you to be honest with me. You’ve been very vague about your medical history, and that makes it difficult to provide you with the best possible care. If you are hesitant to share something, please tell me. Now, just sit quietly and wait for the technician.
PATIENT: Honest... vague... what does she want from me? It's just a couple of aching knees! Just gonna sit here and wait… wait for the poking and prodding… and the questions… Honestly, this is ridiculous. .
