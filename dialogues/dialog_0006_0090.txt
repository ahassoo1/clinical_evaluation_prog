DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi Brightful, 29 years old… good. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Gorga. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I need to be cleared for it, I believe. It’s a bit difficult to recall all the details, truthfully. My husband… he was the one who did most of the arrangements. It was some time ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay… surgery. Right. Let's see if I can get a little more information here. You said it was some time ago… roughly how long ago were you evaluated for this surgery?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a good question. I believe it was after the accident… yes, the car accident. Let me think… it must have been… almost a year ago? Perhaps a little more? It all feels rather blurry, I apologize. I was… quite shaken up then.
DOCTOR: A year ago… after a car accident. Alright. And what sort of surgery are we talking about, if you recall?
PATIENT: It was… on my face, I believe. Something to do with… reconstruction? After the… damage. He said it would help… make things look… normal again. It was on the left side, definitely. I’m so sorry I can’t be more precise. It’s just… difficult to remember specifics with everything that happened. He handled all the consultations and explained everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Okay, reconstruction on the left side of the face after a car accident… let's see... ah, here we are. Facial reconstruction following a traumatic injury, consultation with Dr. Ramirez, July 12th, 2024. It says here you were being evaluated for potential bone grafting and soft tissue repair. Does that ring a bell?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that… that sounds right. Dr. Ramirez… a very kind doctor. Bone… and soft tissue. Yes, that’s it. It does. It all comes back in little pieces. Thank you for reminding me. It’s a relief to finally… understand what we're talking about. It's been weighing on my mind, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, so the question now is, what are you hoping to get cleared for today?
PATIENT: Well… I received a letter from the surgical center, saying they require a clearance from a physician before scheduling. I believe it’s… to ensure I’m healthy enough for the procedure? To check my overall health, and that there are no… complications that might affect it. I want to go ahead with it, if possible. It's just… I've been putting it off, and I feel it’s time. But I need someone to say it's alright, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-operative clearance. That's perfectly reasonable. So, we'll need to go through a bit of your medical history, do a quick physical exam, and maybe some blood work, just to be sure. Let's start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. My husband always said I was quite fortunate that way. No reactions to anything, as far as we knew. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I've always been… quite robust, health-wise, until… everything happened. At least I didn't have any allergies to worry about!
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not currently. After the initial recovery, Dr. Ramirez took me off everything. There were some painkillers for a while, of course, but I stopped taking those… almost immediately, I think. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Just a strong cup of coffee usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past, other than the facial reconstruction we discussed?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a difficult question. I had chickenpox as a child, naturally. And… a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. But nothing… major. My husband always handled my medical records, so I’m afraid I don’t have a very good memory for details. He insisted I focus on getting better, not worrying about paperwork. I suppose I let him. Is it important that I remember specific illnesses?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, yes, but don't worry about it too much. We can work with what you do remember. Let's move on. How about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she lived to a very good age. A very healthy woman, until the very end. My father… he had some trouble with his heart, I believe. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. That’s all I really know, to be honest. We weren’t a very close family, and medical discussions weren’t… common. It's terrible to admit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your grandmother. Okay. Let's move on. And just to get a full picture, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure what that entails. Do you mean… hobbies? I used to enjoy gardening, very much. And… walking. I haven't done much of either since… well, since my husband passed. It feels rather difficult to find enjoyment in things these days. I suppose that's part of the reason I’m here, isn’t it? To… try and feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gardening, walking… and I understand, feeling normal again. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Absolutely not. My husband and I… we didn't believe in any of that. Very healthy lifestyle, we had. Lots of fresh air, good food, and… each other. It was a simple life, but it was a good one. I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since… well, a very long time ago, before I met him, actually. And I certainly don't smoke. It’s not for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. So, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the surgical site. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor Gorga. I’m ready when you are. Please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning given the circumstances. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's take a look at the surgical site… The surgical site appears well-healed, although there is some visible scarring, as expected. Skin elasticity is… reduced in that area, but not significantly. No signs of infection. Palpation is… slightly tender, but no acute pain. Alright. Everything seems stable, but we'll need some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, it's a little sensitive. As you said, some scarring, naturally. Dr. Ramirez did a very good job, all things considered. Blood work… yes, that sounds sensible. Anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps something I should have mentioned earlier? I'm starting to worry I’ve forgotten something important.
DOCTOR: No, no, you've been very thorough, considering. A little forgetfulness is understandable given everything. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. Just routine, to make sure everything is in order. Is there anything else concerning you right now, or anything you’re experiencing that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No… not really. I mean… sometimes I feel a little… tired. More tired than usual, I suppose. But I assumed that was just… grief. And… the stress of everything. I haven’t been sleeping very well either, but that’s hardly a secret. I suppose I'm just… anxious to get this over with. To finally move on, and… feel like myself again. I keep hoping it will help. It's a silly hope, perhaps.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all. It's a very reasonable hope, and a perfectly valid reason for wanting to proceed. The fatigue and trouble sleeping could be related to grief, stress, or a number of other things. The blood work will help rule out any underlying medical causes. I’ll order those tests right away. I’ll also give you a requisition for an EKG just as a precaution, given your father’s heart trouble. It’s a quick and simple test. After we get the results back, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… yes, that sounds… sensible. I don’t want to take any chances, of course. I just want to be sure. And… thank you, Doctor Gorga. For listening, and for being so thorough. It’s… a relief to finally feel like someone is taking this seriously. I suppose I’ve been bottling things up for a long time. Where would I go to get the blood work and EKG done? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You can get the blood work and EKG done at the lab across the street – 123 Main Street. They’re open until 5 PM today. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, and the EKG results should be available much sooner, possibly within a few hours. My office will contact you as soon as they’re available. Do you have a preferred method of contact – phone or email?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… excellent. I have both a phone and an email address, but perhaps email would be best? I tend to… misplace things these days, and I'm more likely to remember to check my email. It's a small detail, but it helps. And… thank you again, Doctor Gorga. I feel much better already. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or… should I just go and get the tests done?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now. Just go and get the tests done, and we'll take it from there. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once the results are in. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the phone number. Take care, and don't worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Hopefully, it’s just a matter of getting you back on your feet. And… if you feel overwhelmed at any point, please reach out to someone you trust. It’s important to have support. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I will. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
