DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear! It’s lovely to meet you too. Dr. Rosanova, is it? Such a pretty name. Well, it’s these hiccups. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now. Just won’t stop! It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, especially when I’m trying to have a nice chat with folks.
DOCTOR: A week, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, nearly a week! Started right after I had a bit too much fizzy drink at Betty’s birthday. I don't usually drink much of that stuff, but Betty makes a lovely punch… and well, one thing led to another. I thought it would just go away, you know? But no. Here they are, still! hic See? Annoying, aren't they?
DOCTOR: They certainly are! And I understand how disruptive that can be. Okay, so started about a week ago, right after a party where you had a fizzy drink… Any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just… the hiccups. I haven't felt unwell otherwise, no tummy trouble or anything. Maybe a little tired, but I am eighty-six, you know? It could just be old age catching up with me! But I thought I'd better get it checked, just in case. You never know.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you, Mirriam. And getting checked is always a good idea. No tummy trouble, no other new symptoms… Have you tried anything to get rid of them so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, have I! Betty told me to hold my breath, and I tried that, but nearly passed out! Then my grandson, Kevin, told me to drink water upside down. That just made a mess. And I tried a spoonful of sugar… didn’t do a thing. Honestly, I’m running out of ideas! It’s just… hic… persistent.
DOCTOR: Those are some classic remedies! Alright. And you said it started after a fizzy drink, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A big glass of Betty's punch. It wasn't just fizzy, now that I think about it… she puts a bit of ginger ale in it, and maybe some pineapple juice, and… oh dear, I can’t quite recall everything. She’s a very creative cook, Betty is! But it was bubbly, definitely bubbly. I suppose it could have been the bubbles, couldn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly could be. Now, Mirriam, just to get a better picture, do you have any other medical problems, like heartburn or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Oh, now and then I get a bit of heartburn, but nothing terrible. Usually if I eat something spicy, or a big meal. I take those little antacid tablets sometimes, the pink ones. They usually do the trick. Nothing serious, though. I haven't been to the doctor in ages, to be honest. Just for my yearly check-ups, and things like that. This hiccup business is the first proper thing in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional heartburn, managed with over-the-counter antacids. That’s helpful to know. And just to be thorough, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen, if that's alright with you. Just to rule out anything else that might be going on.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course dear, go right ahead! Anything to help. My lungs are probably full of sea air, living so close to the ocean. My grandfather was a fisherman, you know. Always said sea air was the best medicine. And my heart… well, it's been ticking for eighty-six years! Hopefully still going strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds strong and regular, and your lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, everything feels normal there. So, no obvious physical findings. Given the history – the hiccups started after the fizzy drink, no other symptoms, and a normal exam – it's likely these are just benign, temporary hiccups. But because they’ve lasted a week, just to be safe, I’d like to check your potassium levels with a blood test. Sometimes low potassium can cause hiccups, and it's easy to correct.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. Blood test it is. Potassium, you say? I do love bananas, though! Maybe I haven’t been eating enough of those lately. I'll have to make sure Kevin brings me a bunch. A week of hiccups is enough to drive a person to bananas, I tell you! Will the test tell me if it’s something serious? I don't want to worry my family unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: It’s more likely to rule out something serious, Mirriam, rather than finding something to worry about. Most of the time, hiccups are just… hiccups! But it's always best to check, especially when they’re prolonged. We'll send a small sample of blood to the lab, and the results should be back in a day or two. If your potassium is low, we can easily supplement it. And if everything is normal, then we'll just keep an eye on things and see if they eventually resolve on their own. In the meantime, try to avoid carbonated beverages, and eat a balanced diet. And don’t hesitate to call if the hiccups worsen or if you develop any other symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, dear. Avoid fizzy drinks… a small sacrifice to make for a bit of peace and quiet! And balanced diet… Kevin will make sure of that, he's a good boy. He worries about me, you see. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to check me out. Now, where do I go for this blood test? And should I fast beforehand? I always forget these things!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It’s my pleasure. Here's the requisition for the blood test. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. And no, you don't need to fast beforehand. You can eat and drink as usual. The nurse at the front desk can direct you if you have any trouble finding it. And again, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova. You've been very kind and patient. I suppose I'll go and get this blood test done and see what the results say. Hopefully, it's just a lack of bananas! It was lovely meeting you.
DOCTOR: You too, Mirriam. It was lovely meeting you as well. And don't worry too much about the hiccups. We'll get to the bottom of it. And if they are caused by a lack of bananas, well, that’s a very easy fix! Have a good day, and please do call if you need anything at all.
