DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been pretty painful lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back. And how long has it been painful, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started a couple of weeks ago, I'd say. Not too bad at first, just a little ache after I'd been sitting for a while. But it's gotten worse each day.
DOCTOR: A little ache that's progressively worsened… I see. And can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. But sometimes, if I move a certain way, it shoots down my leg a bit. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. Just… in the thigh area. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A dull ache with radiating pain down the thigh… Okay. And does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things! Bending over is bad. And lifting anything, even just groceries. Sitting for too long doesn't help either. Standing for a long time is rough too, actually. I guess just about everything makes it worse these days.
DOCTOR: So, it seems to be aggravated by most movements… bending, lifting, prolonged sitting and standing. And what about anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well… lying down helps, definitely. Especially on my side, with a pillow between my knees. And warm baths feel good for a little while. But it doesn’t last long, you know? It comes back pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and warm baths provide some temporary relief. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it's under control now. I try to watch my salt intake. Other than that… I'm pretty healthy, I think. I walk a bit when I can, but this back is making it hard lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. High blood pressure, now controlled, is helpful information. And you mentioned walking… is that something you’ve been doing regularly, even before the back pain started?
PATIENT: Yeah, I used to walk about thirty minutes most days. Kept me pretty active. But like I said, this back pain… it started a couple of weeks ago, and it's been getting harder and harder to even get a short walk in. It just… hurts too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky so far, I guess. Just the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and a broken arm once when I was a kid. Nothing serious. Never needed an operation or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had back problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mother had some trouble with her back when she got older, but I don't know exactly what it was. Just that it hurt a lot. And my brother, he had a slipped disc years ago, I think. Needed some physical therapy for it. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of back problems in your mother and brother. That's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of medicine for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And no allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. Oh! And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a multivitamin occasionally. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Way. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your back pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just lie down on your stomach on the examination table for me, please. I’m going to gently palpate your back to check for tenderness, and I'll also ask you to perform a few simple movements to assess your range of motion. Let me know if anything causes you pain.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to adjust or anything. It’s a bit sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. I'm going to start by gently pressing on different areas of your back. Just tell me if you feel any pain at a specific spot. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. A little bit to the left of your hand. It’s… a dull ache, but definitely there. Not a sharp pain, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side. And what about when I ask you to bend forward, like you're trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s not good. It hurts… a lot. Not all the way down, but in my lower back. It’s a straining pain, you know? Like something is pulling. I can’t go much further.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, that’s alright. No need to push it. And how about if I ask you to lift your leg straight up while you’re lying flat?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… that’s not good either. It’s a shooting pain down my thigh. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. I feel it in the back of my leg. Maybe don't have me do that one again?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to push it, Mr. Way. That’s very helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a lumbar strain, possibly with some sciatic irritation. The pain radiating down your leg suggests that nerve might be a bit compressed. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a disc herniation, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, that sounds good. I just want to get this figured out, you know? It’s been really bothering me. Is it going to be expensive? I… I don't really have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Way. I’ll see what we can do to get you the most affordable option. We have a financial assistance program here at the clinic, and we can explore that. The X-ray itself isn't overly expensive, but we’ll make sure we discuss the costs upfront before proceeding. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain, and applying ice or heat to your back can also provide some relief. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. Ibuprofen and heat… I can do that. And you’ll check about the cost for the X-ray? That's good. I appreciate that. I don't want to just sit around and let it get worse. It's been hard just getting around, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, speak with you after this consultation to discuss the financial assistance options and schedule the X-ray. She’s very helpful and can answer any questions you have about the process. For now, let’s focus on getting you comfortable. We'll get the results of the X-ray as soon as possible and discuss the best course of action from there. I’m thinking this is likely a muscle strain, but the X-ray will help us confirm that and rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Maria… okay, I’ll talk to Maria. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything. It makes me feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, even if it’s not great news. I think that’s all for now, right?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. That’s what I’m here for. Yes, for now, let’s get you set up with Maria to discuss the X-ray and financial assistance. I’ll have her come in to speak with you now. “Maria, could you please come to exam room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again. I’ll just wait here then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Maria will be with you shortly. Don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all while you wait. And remember to avoid any strenuous activities.
PATIENT: .
