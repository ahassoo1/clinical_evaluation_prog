DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, well. The nurse explained it, I suppose. Pre-op clearance. For...the face. Honestly, a lot of bother, all this checking up. I just want it done. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It may seem like a lot of steps, but these pre-operative checks are essential to ensure the procedure goes as smoothly and safely as possible. We want to minimize any risks and ensure the best possible outcome for you. To begin, could you tell me a little more about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s…lifting. Face lifting. Getting rid of some of this. My daughter convinced me. Says I look…tired. I think I look perfectly fine for eighty-one, thank you very much. But she’s paying for it, so… here I am. Don’t need a detailed explanation of what they’re doing, just need to get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a thoughtful gesture from your daughter, and it's certainly your decision, ultimately. We respect that. Just to be thorough, and for my records, could you tell me when the procedure is scheduled?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday. At that fancy place in the city. Dr. Stern...something. Highly recommended, apparently. And expensive. Look, is this going to take long? I have a gardening club meeting, you know. Very important roses to discuss.
DOCTOR: Roses are indeed very important. I assure you, Mr. Orwin, I will be as efficient as possible. We just need to cover a few key areas. To start, let's briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – perhaps diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, I used to have a bit of indigestion. Now and then. But nothing serious. Take some pills for it when it flares up. Oh, and my knees. They ache a bit, especially in the damp. But everyone gets aches at my age, don’t they? Nothing the doctor hasn’t seen before, I’m sure. I’m generally…sturdy. Been a terrazzo worker my whole life, you know. Hard work. Builds character.
DOCTOR: Terrazzo work—that is hard work. You’ve certainly lived an active life. The indigestion and knee aches are helpful to know. Do you take any medications regularly for either of those, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Just the antacids, when I need them. And a little something for my cholesterol, the doctor put me on it a few years back. Says it was getting high. Small white pill. I can’t remember the name... honestly, I leave that to my daughter. She handles all that. It's not like I enjoy remembering pills. Pointless, really.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Orwin; that's what we’re here for. Your daughter sounds very attentive. Let's see if we can clarify what you take for cholesterol; it's important to know for the surgery. Do you happen to know the dosage of the cholesterol medication?
PATIENT: Dosage? Goodness, no. Numbers and me don't get along. I just take one… little white pill every morning with my breakfast. That's all I know. She gets it sent to the house. Little bottles. Don’t bother me with the details. Is this really necessary? It’s a face lift, not a heart transplant.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. Even with a face lift, certain medications can affect how you respond to anesthesia and how well you heal. It's a precaution, and we want to be as thorough as possible. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Everything my wife used to make, anyway. She was a good cook. Can’t say about new things… haven’t had much cause to try anything adventurous lately. Maybe a rash once, a long time ago, from some sort of berry. But I can’t even remember what kind. It wasn’t serious. Nothing a little cream didn’t fix. Look, can we speed this up? My roses are waiting.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Orwin. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll proceed with a brief physical exam. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a roof when I was doing some work. Set it in a cast. Apart from that… not really. A few bumps and bruises over the years, from the job, naturally. But nothing that needed a hospital stay. Terrazzo work is hard on the body, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly sounds like you've had an active life. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do any close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmph. My wife’s mother had…something with her heart, I think. She died when I was still quite young. And my brother… he wasn't very strong. Always sickly. But apart from that… everyone else was fairly… sturdy. Like me. We were a hardworking family. Honestly, all this family history... what difference does it make now? They’re all gone.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling, Mr. Orwin. It can be difficult to recall distant history. Knowing about family illnesses can sometimes help us understand potential risks and prepare accordingly, though you are right, it doesn’t change the past. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it. And I used to enjoy a little glass of beer with dinner, back in the old days. But not anymore. Doc said it wasn't good for my cholesterol. And drugs? Don't be ridiculous! I'm eighty-one years old! Honestly, what kind of questions are these? Can we please get this over with? My roses…
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Mr. Orwin. We simply need to gather all the necessary information to ensure your safety and wellbeing during the procedure. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t take long. I have a very important gardening club meeting, you know. And if my ‘Peace’ roses don’t get pruned today… well, it won’t be pretty. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, if you could please take a deep breath for me... Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Blood pressure is 140/85, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ear canals are clear, with some age-related cerumen present. Throat appears clear, with no signs of infection. Pulse is regular and strong. Overall, your vital signs are stable. I'm noting the slightly elevated blood pressure, which we can discuss further. Now, I'm going to briefly check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly. What do my reflexes have to do with getting a face lift? Stop poking me! It's undignified! Look, I'm a perfectly healthy eighty-one-year-old man. I've worked hard my entire life. I don't need a full medical workup just to get rid of a few wrinkles! Just tell me if I'm clear to go, or if I need to find another doctor. My roses are suffering!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. You're right; you appear to be in generally good health for your age. The brief neurological exam – the reflex check – is simply a standard part of the pre-operative assessment to ensure everything is functioning properly and to identify any potential risks associated with anesthesia. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is common at your age, but not concerning. Based on my examination and the information you've provided, you appear to be a suitable candidate for the planned face lift. However, I do recommend addressing your slightly elevated blood pressure. I can prescribe a low-dose medication to help manage it, or you can discuss it with your primary care physician. Would you like me to write a prescription for you today?
PATIENT: A prescription? Oh, for goodness sake. Another pill! No, no, no pills. My daughter will fuss. She’s got everything under control. Just…tell me I'm cleared for the surgery. That's all I want to know. And tell me how long it’s going to take. I need to get back to my roses. Honestly, this whole process has been a terrible waste of time. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. Based on my assessment, you are cleared for the face lift procedure on Tuesday. The anticipated duration of the surgery is approximately three to four hours. Please follow any pre-operative instructions provided by Dr. Stern’s office regarding fasting and medication restrictions. I strongly recommend monitoring your blood pressure regularly and discussing it with your primary care physician. While I won't prescribe medication at this time, it's important to address it for your overall health. Here is a summary of our visit to share with Dr. Stern, and a note for your primary care physician about the elevated blood pressure reading. Do you have any further questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… wrinkles. Get rid of the wrinkles. That's all that matters. Thank you. Or, rather, I suppose I should say thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have roses to prune. Honestly, doctors these days… all this fuss over nothing.
