DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, mind you, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago, outta nowhere. Honestly, I haven’t felt right for weeks, but this… this is new. And frankly, I don’t do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say. Yes, well, that is concerning, though as you mentioned, quantity is important. Weeks of not feeling right… could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What’s to elaborate? Just… tired. Achy. No appetite, which is saying something, believe me. I used to be able to put away a whole roasted chicken myself. Now, even a sandwich feels like too much work. And this heartburn… burns like fire, especially at night. I thought it was just… old age catching up, but now with the… you know… I figured I better come in. Don't get me wrong, I don't like wasting anyone’s time, especially not yours, Doctor. It’s just… it’s worrying.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” as you put it, rarely presents with hematemesis, Mr. Gentz. Though I understand your reluctance to seek medical attention. Let’s review a few things. Have you noticed any dark, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Tarry… like black? Yeah, actually. Come to think of it, I did. Thought it was something I ate, honestly. A bit of overdone steak, maybe. But it's been happening more than once, now that you mention it. Not every time, but… yeah. Black stools. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I ain't got time for serious. I got things to do. Things that require… energy.
DOCTOR: Melena, as we call it, is rarely attributable to “overdone steak,” Mr. Gentz. It suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We'll need to investigate. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… antacids. The pink kind. When the heartburn gets really bad. And… used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor took me off of it. Said it wasn't necessary anymore. That was… oh, five, six years ago, maybe? Nothing else. I don't believe in filling my body with a bunch of chemicals if I can avoid it. What kind of investigation are we talking about, Doctor? I’m not keen on… procedures, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Antacids only mask the symptoms, Mr. Gentz. They don't address the cause. And while I appreciate your aversion to “chemicals,” ignoring a potential internal bleed is not advisable. We’ll start with some blood work to assess your hemoglobin and hematocrit. Then, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Not to anything. Dust maybe, but who isn't allergic to dust? Look, Doctor, this blood work… is it gonna take long? I got… a schedule. And what's a “hemo-whatever” anyway? Is it gonna hurt? I really don’t do well with needles. Honestly. It’s a… sensitive issue. And are you sure this isn't just… indigestion? Maybe I ate something bad. Something I can't remember. This whole thing is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: “Indigestion” does not typically present with hematemesis and melena, Mr. Gentz. Hemoglobin and hematocrit measure the amount of red blood cells in your system. A simple blood draw, yes. It will be a minor discomfort, and relatively quick. We need a baseline to assess the severity of the bleeding. Now, let's proceed with the physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and check your vital signs.
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m warning you, Doctor, if this is just a wild goose chase, I’m holding you personally responsible for the wasted time. And don't expect me to be thrilled about it. I haven’t got all day. And be gentle, alright? This old body doesn’t bounce back like it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Just breathe normally. Tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oof! Yeah, a little. Right… there. And a little bit… higher up. Not like a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Is that… bad? Look, Doctor, you’re pressing pretty hard. My ribs are sensitive, you know. I used to do a lot of heavy lifting, back in the day. Crematory work ain't exactly easy on the body. You’re gonna find some tenderness, naturally. Is this getting us anywhere, or are we just poking around? I got things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Tenderness is noted, Mr. Gentz. Your vital signs are… within normal limits, though your heart rate is slightly elevated. We’ll need to review the blood work results. I’m also concerned about your history of fatigue and the recent onset of melena. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. I’d also recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize the source of the bleeding, but I understand your hesitation. We can discuss it further once we have the lab results.
PATIENT: "Comprehensive what-now?" Look, Doctor, I ain't a scientist. I just wanna know what's wrong with me and how long it’s gonna take to fix it. All these tests… they sound expensive. And frankly, I don’t have a lot of money to throw around. And an “endo-what-sit”? You’re sticking a camera where? Absolutely not. No way. I’m telling you, it’s just something I ate. Bad shrimp, maybe. I’ve had bad shrimp before. Just give me something for the heartburn and I’ll be fine. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, dismissing potentially serious symptoms as "something you ate" is imprudent. While I appreciate your desire to avoid extensive testing, I cannot in good conscience provide treatment without a proper diagnosis. The lab results will provide crucial information. Ignoring the possibility of a bleeding ulcer or other underlying condition could have severe consequences. I strongly urge you to reconsider the endoscopy. However, I will order the lab work as you requested. Once the results are available, we can discuss your options further. I will have the lab requisition ready for you. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the findings. .
