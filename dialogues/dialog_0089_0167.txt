DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aloha, Doctor Roseburrough. Good to meet you too. Well, my foot… it hurts. Been hurting for a little while now, and it’s getting worse. It’s got a sore on it, I think. A bad one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that's been getting worse. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. It started small, like a little cut. I didn't think much of it, just a scrape maybe. But it didn't get better, and now... now it's deep. And red. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It hurts to walk, even with slippers. I’m a preschool teacher, you know. Lots of standing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a small cut, didn’t heal, and is now deep and red, causing pain with walking. And you’re a preschool teacher, so you're on your feet a lot. Got it. How long has it been hurting, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It’s been maybe… two, three months now? It's hard to say exactly. Time goes by, you know. The pain… it was just a little ache at first. But in the last month or so, it’s gotten much, much worse. It wakes me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, two to three months, starting as a mild ache and progressing to waking you up at night. Have you noticed any pus or drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Pus? I... I don't know what that looks like, exactly. There’s sometimes… a little wetness. Not a lot. Just a bit. It smells… not good. Is that pus? I’ve been trying to keep it clean with soap and water, but it doesn’t seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, some wetness with an odor. That certainly could be pus. It's good you've been trying to keep it clean. Have you had a fever, chills, or felt generally unwell at all recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot. And no chills. I feel… tired, maybe. But I’m old, Doctor! I’m always a little tired. It’s hard to say if it’s something wrong or just… old age. But I haven't been feeling sick, like with a cold or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or general sick feeling, just some fatigue. And you’re a preschool teacher, so you're on your feet a lot. Let’s take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you are. Be gentle, please. It's quite sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the ulceration here. It's quite deep, and there is some drainage present, as you mentioned. I’m also noticing some redness and warmth around it. Palpating it, it’s definitely tender. Do you have diabetes, or any other medical conditions that might affect wound healing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The diabetes. I have that. Been having it for many years now. The doctor… my other doctor… he told me to watch my feet very carefully. I try to, but… things happen. I also have… high blood pressure, I think. And my knees aren’t so good. But the diabetes is the important one, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, the diabetes is very important, and explains why this wound isn't healing well. Okay. I'm concerned about a possible infection in the wound, given the redness, tenderness, and drainage, along with your diabetes. We need to take this seriously. I'm going to order some lab tests to confirm whether there’s an infection and what kind of bacteria is causing it. We'll need a wound culture, and I also want to check your blood sugar and kidney function. We may also need an X-ray to see if the infection has spread to the bone. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want it to get better. It hurts too much. Bone? Oh dear… Is that bad? I don’t want to lose my foot. I need it for teaching the children. They need their teacher.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's not jump to conclusions about losing your foot. We’re going to figure this out. The X-ray is just to rule out a bone infection, which would require more aggressive treatment, but it's not a certainty by any means. I'm going to send you to the lab for the bloodwork and wound culture right away. Then, we’ll get the X-ray done here in the clinic. We will also need to offload weight from your foot, so I'm going to prescribe you a walking boot to keep pressure off of it. And we need to keep the wound clean and dressed. The nurse will show you how to do that properly. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Blood tests, wound tests, X-ray, boot… and keep it clean. The nurse will help me. That’s good. A boot… that sounds… uncomfortable. But if it helps, I will try. Thank you, Doctor Roseburrough. I appreciate your help. I just want to be able to teach my little ones again.
DOCTOR: Okay, it will take some getting used to, but it's important. I'm going to write up the orders for the lab tests and the X-ray now. The nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to get you started. And she’ll go over the wound care instructions with you in detail. In the meantime, try to stay off your foot as much as possible. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible and discuss the next steps then. I’ll also put in a referral to a podiatrist for a second opinion and specialized wound care. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? Another doctor? Well… if you think it’s best. More help can’t hurt, I suppose. Yes, okay. Thank you, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want this to be over with. I miss my children.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s a lot, but we’re going to get you on the right track. Maria will be in shortly to get things started. She's wonderful, and will explain everything very clearly. And we will get you back to your children as soon as we can. I'm writing up the orders now, and I'll have the nurse print out a work/school note for you explaining your limitations. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. And please, if you experience any fever, chills, or increased pain or redness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Fever, chills, more pain… emergency room. And Maria will help. You've been very kind, Doctor Roseburrough. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all I can remember right now. I’m a little tired. I will wait for Maria.
DOCTOR: Okay. You take it easy. I’ll have Maria come in right away.
