DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s… frequent, I suppose you’d say. I don't really remember when it started, just that it’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. “A little while now” – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a tricky one. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps… a few weeks? Maybe a month or so? It all feels a bit… blurred, to be frank. It hasn’t been too disruptive, but it’s enough to notice, and it’s starting to worry me a little. I just thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good you're getting it checked out. A few weeks to a month… okay. And is it just frequent urination, or are you experiencing any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… I don’t believe so. No pain, no fever… nothing like that. I think I’m sleeping alright. Sometimes I get up once during the night, but I always have, really. No, I can’t recall anything else out of the ordinary. It's just… the constant need to go. It's a bit inconvenient, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no fever, normal sleep. Just the increased frequency. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… that’s a good question. I haven’t been paying that close attention, I’m afraid. It looks… normal, I think? The usual color. No blood, no… foam, or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at noticing those sorts of things. I try to be observant, but… it escapes me. It seems normal, but I couldn’t swear to it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Keoni. We can take a look. Now, have you had any changes in your fluid intake recently?
PATIENT: Fluid intake… Hmm. I don’t think so, not really. I usually drink a couple of glasses of water during the day, perhaps a cup of tea in the afternoon. I haven’t been drinking significantly more or less than usual, no. Unless… has the weather been hotter lately? Perhaps I’ve been drinking a bit more water because of that, but it’s not a conscious effort, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible increase in fluid intake due to warmer weather. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history… that's another area where my memory fails me. I had… something with my knee years ago, a sports injury, but it was treated and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. And I was divorced a few years back, if that counts as a medical condition. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. I don’t have any major illnesses or anything. No diabetes, no heart problems… I don’t think so, at least. It’s all a bit hazy, I'm afraid. I am not insured, so I try to avoid going unless it's absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, previous knee injury, otherwise generally healthy. And you’re currently uninsured. That’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Just the knee, I believe. A minor arthroscopy, many years ago, to repair some cartilage damage. It was a fairly routine procedure, and I recovered well. Other than that… no, I don’t recall any other surgeries. Nothing major, certainly. It was quite a long time ago, though, so perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me again. I truly wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It’s frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthroscopy on the knee. And no other surgeries to your knowledge. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather had something with his heart, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t very close. Honestly, Doctor, I don't know much about my family’s medical background. We didn’t really discuss those things, and I don’t have many relatives left. It's not much help, I’m afraid. I apologize for my vagueness. It feels as though I'm failing to be a cooperative patient.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Keoni. It's perfectly understandable. You've given me what you can. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I find it quite repulsive, actually. I always try to stay as healthy as possible. Though, as you can see, my memory isn’t exactly helping me with that at the moment! But I do try, Doctor. I really do. I eat a balanced diet, try to get enough sleep… It’s just this… this frequent urination that’s troubling me.
DOCTOR: Good, no smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. Just a small glass, to relax. I'm not much of a drinker, really. I prefer tea, if I’m honest. It doesn’t interfere with my life, Doctor. It’s just a social thing, mostly. I don't have it every day, and I certainly don't drink to excess.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods without issue. I've never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I do get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but it’s mild and easily managed with over-the-counter medication. Other than that… no, I don’t believe I have any allergies. I wish my memory was better; perhaps there’s something I’m forgetting. It's rather frustrating. I apologize again for my vagueness, Doctor. I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Keoni. It's very helpful to have this information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. As I mentioned, I prefer to manage things naturally, if I can. I don’t take any vitamins, supplements, or anything like that. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that's very rare. I'm generally quite healthy, as far as I can tell. Unless… does a cup of herbal tea count? I sometimes have chamomile tea to help me relax, but it’s not a medication, is it? I just thought I should mention it, in case it's relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional chamomile tea. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a basic check of your vitals and a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I admit I'm a bit anxious, but I understand it's necessary. Please just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I'm ready when you are. I just hope it doesn't take too long. My memory… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 120/80, which is normal. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really pain, Doctor, but it’s a bit… sensitive, perhaps? Around my lower abdomen, just below my belly button. It’s hard to explain. It’s not excruciating, just… uncomfortable. I often feel a bit bloated in that area, too, but I thought it was just… digestion. It’s probably nothing, honestly. I tend to worry about things. Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of tenderness in the lower abdomen. I’m going to check your neurological reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to have you follow my finger with your eyes. Everything looks good so far. Based on this quick exam, there isn’t anything immediately concerning, but the tenderness in your lower abdomen is something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things. We will start with a urinalysis and a complete blood count to get a baseline.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. A urinalysis and a blood count… yes, that sounds sensible. Will I need to provide a sample now, then? And will the blood count require a needle? I confess I’m not very good with needles. It’s a silly fear, I know, but…
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll need a urine sample. There’s a restroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a cup, and instructions on how to collect it properly. And yes, the blood count will require a small blood draw. I understand your apprehension about needles. We can take things slowly, and I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. We have a very skilled phlebotomist who is excellent at minimizing discomfort. Would you like me to explain the procedure beforehand?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be very helpful, Doctor. Knowing what to expect would certainly ease my anxiety. I appreciate your patience. It’s… embarrassing to admit I’m afraid of something so small, but… I just get very flustered. And yes, explaining the procedure would be wonderful. Perhaps you could tell me what exactly they’ll be looking for in the blood count and the urine sample? Just so I can understand everything a little better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The urinalysis will check for things like infection, blood, glucose, and protein in your urine. It can help rule out a urinary tract infection, which is a common cause of frequent urination. The complete blood count, or CBC, will give us information about your overall health. It checks your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help identify any signs of infection, anemia, or other underlying conditions. The needle will be very small, and the phlebotomist will only take a small amount of blood. They'll use a tourniquet to make your veins more visible, and then insert the needle briefly. It may sting slightly, but it shouldn’t be painful. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that… that makes sense, actually. Checking for infection and other conditions… yes, that seems logical. And a small needle… alright. A brief sting… I suppose I can manage that. So, the restroom is down the hall, and I’ll collect a sample? And then I’ll come back and… let the phlebotomist draw some blood? Just to confirm, Doctor, there’s no charge for these tests, is there? I apologize for asking, but I’m… financially constrained at the moment, as you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Restroom down the hall, collect a sample in the cup provided, and then come back and we'll have the phlebotomist draw your blood. And regarding the cost… we do have a program for uninsured patients, and we can discuss payment options. We don’t want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first, and then we can work out the billing details. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful, Doctor. Truly. Knowing there’s a program for uninsured patients is a huge weight off my shoulders. Focusing on the tests first… yes, that’s the best approach. Alright. I’ll go and collect the sample now. Thank you, Doctor Bombara, for your kindness and patience. I appreciate it more than words can say.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. Take your time. I'll be here when you get back. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need any assistance.
