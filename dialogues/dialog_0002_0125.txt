DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Ranjan. Look, to be perfectly honest, my wife thought it was a good idea. I’m here for an HIV test. She worries too much, always has. But, better safe than sorry, I suppose. Though I can’t imagine why I’d need one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, and it’s thoughtful of your wife to encourage that. Even if you feel like it's unlikely, routine testing is a responsible thing to do. Just to be thorough, and so I have a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about why your wife is concerned?
PATIENT: Honestly? She watches too much television. All those… stories. And she's got this habit of reading things online. Things that just aren’t… realistic. She’s got a very vivid imagination, my wife. She'll see something on the news about, you know, people and immediately think it's going to happen to us. It's exhausting, really. I assure you, I haven't done anything that would require a test. I've been married fifteen years, haven't given her a reason to doubt me for a single moment.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like she’s just a bit anxious and overcautious, and that can definitely be tiring. It's good you have a long and stable marriage – that’s wonderful. Regardless of the reason, we can absolutely get the test done for your peace of mind. Before we proceed, though, I need to ask a few questions to understand your risk factors a bit better. This is standard procedure, and it helps me make sure we're doing the right thing. Have you ever had any previous HIV tests?
PATIENT: No. Never. Like I said, it hasn't been… necessary. And frankly, I find the whole conversation a bit… insulting. But fine, if you have to ask. No, I have not. And I doubt I ever will again, after this. I just want to get it over with and prove her wrong. Is that alright? Can we just… do the test?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize if the questions feel insensitive. You are right to feel that way, and I want to assure you I’m not questioning anything. It's just my job to cover all bases, and sometimes that means asking questions that seem unnecessary. Before we move to the test itself, could you briefly tell me about any medical conditions you have, or any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Never been seriously ill a day in my life. As for surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, ages ago. That's it. Nothing else. I take a daily multivitamin, that's all. Medicare covers it, thankfully. I don’t want to sit here all day listing childhood ailments. Can we please get on with it? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child and a daily multivitamin. That's good to know. And I understand your frustration – I apologize for taking up your time. Just a couple more quick questions, and then we can proceed with the test. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None whatsoever. Not to food, not to medications, not to bee stings, nothing. I eat everything. My wife always complains I eat too much, actually. I'm a very robust man. Honestly, Dr. Ranjan, are these questions really necessary? It feels like you’re fishing for something that isn’t there.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I appreciate your patience. They are standard questions, and I want to explain why. Even with a low risk, it’s important to rule out anything that could interfere with the test results or affect your overall health. It’s part of providing the best possible care. Alright, last question, and then we’ll get to the test. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? Goodness, no. Where would I even get a blood transfusion? I haven't been hospitalised since I was a child with a bad case of chickenpox! This is getting ridiculous. You’re making me feel like I’m… I don’t know. Some sort of… risk. Which is frankly insulting. I just want a simple test to appease my wife and then I want to leave. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – you're perfectly justified in feeling that way. I am truly sorry for making you feel scrutinized and insulted. I assure you that's not my intention. My goal is to be thorough, and I’ve clearly overdone it in this case. Okay, no blood transfusions. Let's move forward with the test. We can do a simple finger prick test here in the office, it takes about 20 minutes to get the results. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, a finger prick is fine. Just get it over with. I have a garden to tend to, you know. Honestly, the stress of this whole conversation is probably worse than anything else. Just… hurry up, please. And try not to stick me too many times. I don't like needles. Though, frankly, I doubt I'll feel a thing. I'm a very stoic man, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. And I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. This will just be a tiny prick, and I'll have a bandage ready. Okay, all done. Now we just wait about 20 minutes for the results to develop. While we wait, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just let me know when this… thing… is finished. I'm going to sit over there and try to relax. Don't bother me unless you have the results. And please, tell me they're negative. For my own sanity, if nothing else. My wife will never let me live it down otherwise.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are available. Feel free to relax. I'll be right here if you need anything.
