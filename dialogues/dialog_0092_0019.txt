DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me? My wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? We think… maybe need help. I forget things easy, so… maybe she explain better. But… we want baby.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It’s wonderful that you and your wife are considering this. It's perfectly alright that you're finding it difficult to recall everything – that's why I’ll be speaking with both of you. So, just to clarify, you and your wife are hoping to start a family, and you're wondering about options given your ages?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That right. Ages… we… not young chickens anymore! She do most of the thinking these days. I make things with my hands… metal, plastic… not so good with… words, or plans. But… we very happy, and want little one. If… if possible.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely to hear, Mr. Carlotta. It's wonderful that you share such a strong bond. And it’s perfectly fine if you find it difficult to articulate things – I’m here to help, and we'll take our time. Before we discuss options, I'd like to gather some more information. To start, have either you or your wife seen any doctors recently – perhaps for a general check-up, or for any specific health concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm… my wife, she go to the doctor… sometimes. For… the blood pressure, I think. And… maybe the heart? She forget to tell me everything. I… I go when something really break! But… not recently. No. Just… little aches and pains. Old man stuff. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, Mr. Carlotta. Knowing about your wife's blood pressure and heart health is important, as those conditions can influence family planning. And yes, any health concerns you have are important too. Do you happen to know what medications your wife is currently taking for her blood pressure or heart, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… medications. She keep the little bottles… in the kitchen, I think. White ones, mostly. She take them every morning… with her tea. I… I don't know the names. Sorry. She’s good with remembering those things. I'm better with… making things. Maybe she write them down? I not sure.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Carlotta. We can certainly ask your wife when she joins us. It's helpful to have a list of her medications, just to ensure everything is safe. Now, let's talk a little about your own health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not that I remember. I work with metal, you know? Sometimes… little cuts, burns. But nothing… serious. Doctor always say… “be careful!” I’m strong man. Always been strong. Maybe a little tired now, but… old age, you know? No big problems. I don’t think so. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… when I was young, very young, I break my leg. Playing football. They… fix it. But that long time ago. Very long time. And… maybe some teeth pull out? I forget. Nothing important. Just… old man things. No big surgeries. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What you mean? My father… he strong man, like me. Work with his hands. My mother… she good cook. And… many brothers and sisters. Big family. Everyone healthy, I think. No… no one die young, or… have bad sickness. Not that I remember. We don’t talk much about… sickness. We talk about happy things. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Knowing that your family generally has been healthy is good information. Sometimes, certain illnesses can run in families, and it's helpful to be aware of that. To help me understand your overall health, could you tell me about any habits you have?
PATIENT: Habits? I drink tea. Lots of tea. Every day. And… sometimes I smoke a little. Not much anymore. Just… when I'm thinking. And… I eat. I like food. My wife, she cook good food. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Carlotta. It's helpful to know these things. Drinking tea is fine, and we can discuss the smoking a bit later. As for enjoying good food, that’s wonderful! Now, before your wife arrives, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay. That fine. Blood pressure… yes. Heart… lungs… I not scared. I strong man. But… maybe you go easy? I old. Metal and plastic… that easy work. This… maybe hard.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. I'll be very gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here on the table. Just relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. This is not uncommon in someone your age, but we should keep an eye on it. Lungs sound clear, good air entry bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Everything sounds reasonably good, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur are things we'll want to monitor.
PATIENT: Murmur? What you mean murmur? Is that bad? My heart… still working? Metal and plastic… that never murmur! Maybe I drink too much tea? Is that it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be concerned, Mr. Carlotta. A murmur is simply an extra sound that can be heard when listening to the heart. It doesn’t always mean there’s a problem. Many murmurs are harmless, especially in older adults. It's likely just a normal change that happens with age. We can monitor it with regular check-ups. Drinking too much tea isn’t likely to cause a murmur directly, but it could potentially contribute to slightly elevated blood pressure. It’s good to be mindful of your caffeine intake. We can discuss that further later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… No, I don't think so. I never have any trouble with… anything. Maybe a little dust sometimes. But that just make me sneeze. Strong man… don't get allergies! My wife… she sometimes get itchy. But that the flowers, I think. Not me. No allergies. I sure about that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Carlotta. And what about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think… no. I don’t take any medications. Maybe sometimes… when my knee hurt, I take something from the shop. But that just when it really bad. And I forget what it was. Little white pill, I think. Not every day. Just… sometimes. Nothing regular. Just… old man aches and pains. And my wife… she keep the good medicine. Not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, is there anyone else with you today?
PATIENT: No. Just me. My wife… she coming. She take her time. Always take her time. She said she need to… arrange things. Women… always arranging things. But she coming. She said… soon. She good. Very good. But she take her time. Just me now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. We can certainly go over everything again when she arrives, if you'd like. While we’re waiting, let’s recap what we’ve discussed so far. You're here today with your wife, hoping to start a family. You have no known allergies and aren’t currently taking any regular medications. You've had a broken leg in the past, and experience occasional aches and pains. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and a murmur was detected during the exam. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that right. Broken leg… long time ago. Aches and pains… always. Murmur… you say murmur. Scary word. Blood pressure… a little high. And… we want baby. That most important. My wife… she very good. Maybe she explain better. She good with words. I good with metal. She coming soon, I hope.
DOCTOR: That's right. And we'll certainly discuss all of this thoroughly when your wife arrives. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, Mr. Carlotta. We'll do everything we can to help you both achieve your goal, and I'll answer any questions you both have. While we wait, would you like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Water? Yes. That good. Thank you. Metal work… make me thirsty. Yes, water… that good. She coming? Women and arranging things… always.
DOCTOR: Here you go. That's alright, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife will be here when she’s ready. We have all the time in the world. And in the meantime, if anything comes to mind, please don’t hesitate to ask.
PATIENT: .
