DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, have a seat. Forty-seven years old, eh?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That is correct. August second, 2025. A good day for a visit, though I wish it weren’t needed. I appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: Right. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s about the masks at work, Doctor Batara. My job…well, it’s Protective Services. And they’re requiring us to wear them all day. I'm hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or…something. I have some trouble with them, and it's making things difficult.
DOCTOR: Protective Services… strenuous work, I imagine. And you're having trouble with the masks. Specifically what kind of trouble, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, it can be. A lot of being on your feet, and…well, dealing with people. As for the masks, it's…hard to explain. It feels like I can't breathe properly when I have it on for too long. Not a panic feeling, exactly, but…tightness. And I get very dizzy. It's hard to focus when I'm dizzy, and that's not good for my work. I've tried different kinds, but it doesn’t seem to matter much.
DOCTOR: “Tightness” and “dizziness.” Vague symptoms, Mr. Knabenshue. Very vague. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or any other lung condition?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, never. I've never had any trouble breathing before the masks. I’ve always been fairly healthy, as far as I know. My family… we haven't had much history of lung trouble either. I do get winded easily when I run, but that’s just because I’m not a runner, you understand. It’s never been anything I worried about. This is new, all since the masks started.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to… anything?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, ma’am. I eat most anything. I've never had a bad reaction to food, or plants, or…anything. No bee stings, no rashes, nothing like that. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, she also said I was stubborn as a mule, so…take that for what it’s worth.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, when the sun’s not around much. Otherwise, just water and…a lot of walking. I believe in keeping things natural, if you understand. A good night’s sleep and fresh air. That's usually enough for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Let’s have a listen to your lungs. Sit back and take a deep breath for me, if you would.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'll do my best. It might be a little… rough, if it has to do with the masks. But I'll try.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. That’s…unexpected. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, regular. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Have you considered that this might be… anxiety, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Anxiety, ma’am? I… hadn’t thought of that. I mean, the job is stressful, I suppose. Dealing with people in difficult situations. But I’ve been doing it for a long time, and I usually handle it okay. It's not the stress that bothers me, it’s the feeling of…suffocating. The masks feel…wrong. It's a physical discomfort, not…worry. Though, I appreciate you considering all the possibilities. Perhaps it’s a bit of both? It's hard to separate things sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s common for physical sensations to be exacerbated by stress, Mr. Knabenshue. Perhaps a trial of a relaxation technique… or even a low dose anti-anxiety medication, if this continues to interfere with your work. But before we go down that road, let’s rule out any other possibilities. I’m going to check your heart rate while you’re walking, just to make sure there isn't anything… underlying. If you'll follow me. Just a short walk down the hall and back.
PATIENT: Alright, ma’am. I’ll follow you. I understand wanting to rule things out. A walk is fine. Just let me know if you need me to stop or slow down. I'm not one for pills, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Pulse is elevated now – 90, but still regular. No irregularities. Blood pressure is 140/90 – slightly elevated, but likely due to exertion. Breathing seems…normal. No labored breathing, no wheezing. It’s… puzzling. Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, I’m not finding any objective evidence to support a medical reason why you can’t wear a mask. Perhaps you could try a different style – an N95 with a better fit?
PATIENT: I appreciate you checking, ma’am, I truly do. But I’ve tried different styles. Surgical masks, cloth masks, N95s…the fit doesn’t seem to matter. It’s not the fit, it’s the sensation of having something over my face. It feels… constricting. I understand you’re not finding anything objectively wrong, but that doesn’t mean it’s not affecting me. My work requires focus, and it’s hard to focus when I feel like I can’t breathe properly. I'm not trying to be difficult, I just… need to find a solution. Is there anything else we can try? Perhaps a specialist? Someone who deals with…sensory issues?
DOCTOR: A specialist?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. If there’s nothing else obvious, perhaps someone who specializes in… I don’t know, maybe environmental sensitivities? Or a breathing therapist? I’ve read things online, about people having trouble with masks for reasons other than asthma or allergies. It’s…a new thing, and maybe there are experts who are learning about it. I’m not sure what the right term is, but someone who could help me understand why this is happening, and what I can do about it. I just want to be able to do my job safely, and right now, the masks are making that very difficult.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Knabenshue. I will refer you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a pulmonologist. She has a reputation for…thoroughness. However, I must caution you – I highly doubt she will find any medical basis for your concerns. But, I suppose it is your prerogative to seek a second opinion. I will also document your request for accommodation in your chart. I will need you to sign a waiver acknowledging that you are seeking an exemption against workplace safety protocols, and that you understand the potential risks involved. Do you agree?
PATIENT: A waiver… Yes, ma’am, I agree. I understand the risks. I’m not trying to circumvent safety protocols, I just need to find a way to do my job safely within those protocols, or…an alternative. I’ll sign whatever paperwork is necessary. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my situation, even if you don't agree with it. I trust Dr. Vance will be thorough, and hopefully, we can find some answers. Where would I sign the waiver?
DOCTOR: Here you are. Read it carefully. It details your responsibility to adhere to all workplace safety regulations, even with an accommodation. It also acknowledges that you’ve been advised of the potential risks involved in not wearing a mask. Sign here, initial here, and date. Once that’s done, I’ll send the referral to Dr. Vance. And Mr. Knabenshue... try to manage your anxiety. It sounds like that's a large part of this.
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. It’s clear. Here you are, Doctor. I’ve signed and dated it. Thank you again for your time, and for the referral to Dr. Vance. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously, and I’ll be sure to follow up with her office as soon as possible. Hopefully, we can find a solution that works for everyone. I think that’s all I needed.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month, to review your progress. And Mr. Knabenshue?
