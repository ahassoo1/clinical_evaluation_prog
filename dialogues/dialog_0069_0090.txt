DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I’m here for a check-up to make sure I’m healthy enough for it? It’s all a little… fuzzy, honestly. It was something my husband and I discussed for a long time, and now… well, now I’m trying to move forward with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A pre-operative check-up. It’s common to feel a little overwhelmed when starting this process, so don't worry about it being "fuzzy." We’ll go through everything at your pace. Could you tell me what kind of surgery you’re considering?
PATIENT: It’s… a facelift, Doctor. And perhaps a bit with the eyes as well. My husband… he always said it would help restore my confidence. He had such good taste. I’m not entirely sure of the technical details, I’m afraid. It was mostly conversations, planning… before.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is something you and your husband put a lot of thought into. It's perfectly alright not to know all the technical details. We can certainly discuss those, or I can connect you with the surgeon to go over those specifics. Before we talk about the surgery itself, let’s just get a good picture of your overall health. Could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… I… I don’t have a lot of major illnesses, if that’s good. I was generally very healthy. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, but nothing… serious. More recently… after my husband passed, I did see a doctor for a bit of trouble sleeping, but it wasn't anything they couldn’t manage with medication. I haven't been to the hospital in… oh, goodness, it must be close to ten years now. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it sounds like you’ve been proactive about addressing the sleep issues, which is great. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me what medications you’re currently taking for the sleep, and if you take anything else at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… for sleep, I believe it was… Trazodone. Yes, that’s it, Trazodone. A low dose, just enough to… take the edge off. And… Oh! Sometimes I take ibuprofen for… aches and pains. Just occasionally, when I’ve been working in the garden for too long. Nothing regular, truly. I don’t take any vitamins or anything like that, if that matters. I try to eat healthy, but I’m not very strict about it. I’m not the best at remembering these things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. We can always double-check things. It's good to know you're taking Trazodone and occasional ibuprofen. I make a note of that. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't believe so. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I occasionally get a little itchy when I'm around cats, but I don't think that's a true allergy, just… sensitivity. Nothing serious enough to require an EpiPen or anything. And no food allergies that I'm aware of. I eat pretty much everything. I'm quite lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your immediate family – parents, siblings – has any significant medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a little tricky. My mother passed away when I was quite young, from… complications, the doctors said. Not a specific illness, just… her health deteriorated. And my father… he was a very private man. I don’t recall him having any major ailments, but we weren’t very close, so I wouldn’t necessarily know. He did smoke for many years, I believe. As for siblings… I’m an only child, I'm afraid. So, not much to go on there, I’m afraid. It’s… a bit of a blank, really.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Brightful. We can’t always have a complete picture. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle – things like your diet, exercise habits, and whether you smoke or drink alcohol. Just to get a better understanding of your overall health.
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I try to be healthy. I eat a fairly balanced diet – lots of fruits and vegetables, mostly. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning, of course! As for exercise… I do a lot of gardening. It’s very physical work, digging and planting and so on. So, I get plenty of exercise that way. And… I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps a couple of times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. And I’ve never smoked, thankfully. I always thought it was a dreadful habit.
DOCTOR: That all sounds very reasonable. Thank you. Now, before we move on, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That's perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I understand it’s important to check everything thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. I’ll also palpate your thyroid. It’s a fairly standard exam. Okay, Ms. Brightful. Your height is 155 centimeters and your weight is 93 kilograms. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your thyroid feels normal. I didn't find anything concerning during the exam, but your blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. I also note your BMI is elevated. Do you have any history of hypertension or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hypertension… hmm. I don't believe so, Doctor. I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything like that. I've had my blood pressure checked before, during routine visits, but it was never… cause for concern, as far as I recall. And no, no history of high cholesterol either. My husband always encouraged me to eat healthily, so I’ve always tried to be mindful of that. Is it something serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve been mindful of your health. While one elevated reading isn't necessarily cause for panic, it's something we need to investigate further. We should repeat the blood pressure check over a few visits to confirm if it’s consistently high. We’ll also want to order some blood work to check your cholesterol levels and kidney function, just to get a complete picture. It’s often manageable with lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress reduction – and sometimes medication if needed. Now, returning to the planned surgery, given your blood pressure, we may want to get clearance from a cardiologist before proceeding. They can assess your cardiovascular risk and advise on whether it’s safe to move forward. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… Oh dear. Well, if it's necessary for my health, then yes, of course. I understand. It’s just… a lot. I suppose I was hoping to get this surgery done fairly quickly. But I want to be safe, absolutely. If a cardiologist needs to take a look, then please, do arrange it. Will it delay things significantly? And… who would I see? Do you have a recommendation?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Brightful. It is a lot to process, and I apologize if this adds to the stress. It may cause a slight delay, perhaps a few weeks for the appointment and any necessary testing. But your safety is my priority, and it’s better to be thorough. I recommend Dr. Ramirez. She’s an excellent cardiologist affiliated with St. Luke’s Hospital. I can have my nurse schedule an appointment for you, and she’ll send over the necessary referral paperwork. I will also order the bloodwork now. In the meantime, let’s focus on things you can do to improve your blood pressure. We will want to monitor it at home if possible. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, Doctor. I’ve never needed one before. I don’t own a blood pressure cuff. Oh dear. Is it difficult to use? Should I purchase one? And… what numbers should I be looking for? I'm a bit overwhelmed with everything, I must admit.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Many people don't have one unless they have been specifically instructed to. They are quite simple to use, and I can have my nurse demonstrate how to properly measure your blood pressure before you leave today. Or, I can provide you with a handout with instructions. Ideally, you want your blood pressure to be below 120/80 mmHg. We will be looking for consistent readings above 130/80 mmHg, which is why we want to monitor it at home. Also, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, to help manage your blood pressure while we await the cardiologist appointment. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… okay. A low dose sounds reasonable. I trust your judgement, Doctor. And a demonstration of the blood pressure cuff would be wonderful, please. I want to do everything I can to be ready for the cardiologist. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know what I’m dealing with, even if it’s a bit daunting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I understand it can be a lot to take in. My nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to demonstrate the blood pressure cuff and provide you with some written instructions. She’ll also go over the Lisinopril prescription with you and answer any questions you might have about potential side effects. So, to summarize: I’m ordering bloodwork, prescribing a low dose of Lisinopril, and scheduling an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. We’ll postpone any plans for the facelift until we have clearance from the cardiologist. In the meantime, please monitor your blood pressure at home and keep me updated on any changes or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very thoroughly. I suppose… I'm just a bit worried about the cardiologist appointment. I've never seen one before. But I trust your recommendation. And I’ll do everything you ask. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. It means a lot. Perhaps… just one small thing. How long does it typically take to get an appointment with Dr. Ramirez? That might help me mentally prepare.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question. It can vary depending on her availability, but typically it takes about two to three weeks to get an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. My nurse will do her best to expedite the process. She'll also send you information about what to expect during the appointment and what questions you might want to ask. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We're here to support you every step of the way. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Brightful. I'm confident we can get this sorted out. Maria will be in shortly. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's everything, thank you. I truly appreciate your time and patience. I’m feeling a little less overwhelmed now, knowing what to expect. I’ll await Maria, and I’ll be sure to call if I have any questions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. Take care, and we'll see you soon. .
