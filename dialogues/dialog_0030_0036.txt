DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you're 28 years old. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, Barban is the name. I am here… for the check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare sent me. It is… required, yes? I do not understand much about these things, but the lady on the phone said I need this exam.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that is perfectly alright. A welcome to Medicare exam is quite common. It's essentially a baseline assessment to ensure we have a good understanding of your current health. The lady on the phone was correct – it’s a requirement for starting coverage. To help me with that, I'd like to ask you a few questions. We’ll cover your medical history, any current concerns, and perform a physical exam. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds acceptable. I do not have much history, Doctor. I have not been sick much. Just… normal things, I suppose. A cold, maybe, sometimes. I work in the food factory, you see, and there are many people. It is easy to catch something. But nothing serious. I hope this will not take too long. I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Barban. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. “Normal things” is a good start, and working in a food factory with many people does increase your exposure to illnesses. We'll keep that in mind. Let’s start with the present. Are you experiencing any symptoms right now – anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No. Nothing bothering me. I feel… alright. A little tired, perhaps. But that is from the work. Long hours, you see. It is hot in the factory, also. But not sick. No cough, no fever. Just… tired. Is that what you mean? A symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue can be a symptom, Mr. Barban, and it’s good you mentioned it. We'll definitely explore that further. It’s important to understand why you're feeling tired. Now, let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. You said you haven't been sick much, which is excellent. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have never been told I have any of those things. My family… we are healthy people. Well, mostly. My grandfather, he had problems with his… legs, I think. Old age things. But not me. I am strong. I lift heavy boxes all day. I would know if something was wrong.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Mr. Barban. A strong family history of good health is a positive sign. And it’s good that you are aware of your body. Just to be thorough, has your grandfather’s leg problem been diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: I… I do not know, Doctor. He lived in Yemen, you see. They do not have… many doctors there, like here. He used a cane, and he complained of pain, but… no one wrote anything down. Just old age. He passed away many years ago. Is this important? I do not understand why you ask about someone who is gone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. I apologize if my questions are confusing. Knowing a little about your family history can sometimes help us understand your risk for certain conditions, but it’s not always essential. It sounds like his leg problems were likely related to age, as you said. Let’s move on to something else. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I have not had any surgeries. I have never been in the hospital. I broke my arm when I was a small boy, falling from a tree, but my mother… she fixed it. She knew what to do. She put a cast on it herself. It healed fine. But no hospital. I do not like hospitals. They smell… bad.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Barban. Many people feel that way about hospitals. It’s good to hear your arm healed well with your mother’s care. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I do not take anything. I eat healthy food, mostly. My wife, she cooks good food. Sometimes I drink tea, with sugar. But no pills, no vitamins, nothing. I do not trust these things. They are full of chemicals, I think. My body is strong enough without them.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Barban. Alright, one more question about your background before we move onto a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies – to foods, medications, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I have no allergies. None. I eat everything. My wife makes many different foods. Spicy foods, sweet foods… I have never had a problem. I am not afraid of anything. Except… hospitals, perhaps. But not foods. She puts peanuts in some dishes, sometimes. I eat those, too. No problem. I am a strong man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Barban. It sounds like you have a very healthy constitution. Okay, excellent. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and feeling your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That… is acceptable. As long as it is quick. I have things to do this afternoon. But yes, you can listen and… feel. Just be gentle, please. And do not take too long. I do not like being poked and prodded. Is there a chair I can sit in? I do not like lying down.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. We can absolutely do the exam while you're sitting. It will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please, have a seat. Alright, just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I will briefly look in your ears and throat. Your ears look fine, and your throat is clear. Finally, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. It feels soft and there’s no tenderness. Everything feels normal so far. I will also check your pulse and reflexes quickly. Everything seems to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: Good. It was… not so bad. As long as everything is normal, that is all I care about. So, what does this all mean? Am I healthy? Can I go now? I really must be going. My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, everything does appear to be normal, which is excellent. Based on this initial exam, you seem to be in good health. However, I do want to order a few routine blood tests just to get a more complete picture and establish a baseline for future comparisons. These tests will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other important markers. Would you be willing to have those tests done today?
PATIENT: Tests? More things? I do not like tests. I thought this was all I needed. A quick check and then I can go. What is wrong with me that you need tests? My blood is red, I assure you. And I feel… fine. Is this going to cost me money? I do not have much money. My wife handles those things. I do not want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Barban. These aren’t tests because I suspect anything is wrong. They're simply a standard part of a new Medicare welcome exam to establish a baseline of your health. It helps us monitor your health over time and catch any potential issues early, even before you experience symptoms. The cost should be covered by Medicare, as it’s a preventative service. However, to be absolutely certain, I can have the billing department verify your coverage before proceeding. It's a small blood draw, just a few vials, and it will take about 15-20 minutes. Would you be willing to consider it with the assurance that we'll verify the cost beforehand?
PATIENT: Hm. Verify the cost… that sounds… reasonable. My wife will be pleased. She always wants to know these things. 15 minutes… I suppose I can spare 15 minutes. But quickly, please. And do not poke me too much. I do not like needles. If it is covered by Medicare, then… alright. Do it. But tell the nurse to be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Barban. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns and will be as gentle as possible. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. Once that’s done, we’ll just need a few minutes to discuss the results when they become available, which is usually within a few days. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… the tests. And then I can go home to my wife. She makes very good tea. And I am tired. This has been… a long morning. I do not understand why they need so many tests for someone who feels perfectly fine. But if it makes her happy… then alright. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Barban. We will get this done as quickly as possible. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready. Thank you for your patience. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss your results. .
