DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor…Petrimoulx, was it? Yes, right. Well, it’s this…shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. It’s just…annoying, you know? Makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Petrimoulx is correct. Annoying is a good way to put it, and I understand how frustrating that must be. It's good you're addressing it. When you say “a while now”, could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Gosh… maybe six months? A year? It all kinda blends together these days, you know? I used to work at the water treatment plant… lots of gauges and valves, needed a steady hand. Not so easy now. It’s not constant, thankfully. More when I’m…doing something. Trying to, anyway.
DOCTOR: Six months to a year, alright. And it’s worse when you’re actively trying to do something, like with fine motor skills?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it exactly. Fine motor… that’s a good way to put it. Like, if I try to write… or button my coat… or even just hold a cup steady. See? Not terrible all the time, but it’s there. And it worries me, you know? My father… he had a shake too, later in life. Not sure what it was, though.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned your father had a similar shake. Do you happen to know if he ever received a diagnosis for that?
PATIENT: Diagnosis… no, not that I recall. He was a stubborn man, my father. Didn’t much care for doctors. Just… got worse over time, you know? Eventually, he needed help with a lot of things. It wasn’t a pleasant sight. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. Don’t want that happening to me.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable reason to come in, Mr. Jezik. It’s good you're being proactive. Let's talk a little bit more about your symptoms. Besides the shaking, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Well, I’m a bit slower than I used to be, naturally. Old age, you know? And my balance isn’t what it once was. I nearly tripped over the rug the other day. Nothing serious, just… clumsy. I don't sleep as well either, but who does at my age? Is that what you mean? Other changes?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all helpful things to know, Mr. Jezik. The slowing down, the balance issues, and the sleep disturbance. Have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness… sometimes. Mostly in my hands, actually. Not a sharp pain, more of an ache. Especially in the mornings. I just figured it was arthritis, you know? Lots of people my age have it. I don't bother with doctors for little aches and pains.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to know, though. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. I had… something with my heart, years ago. High blood pressure, I think? They gave me pills for it. I took them for a while, then… well, I stopped. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. Other than that… not much, as far as I recall. I'm a pretty healthy guy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure in the past, and a gallbladder removal. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not a clue. Little white pills, I think? Or maybe pink? It was a long time ago, Doctor. I don’t keep track of those things. My wife… she used to handle all that. She’s gone now, you see. Divorced, a long time ago. Didn't work out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you don't remember the specific medication. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. Don’t believe in loading up on pills unless I absolutely have to. And my wife… she always said vitamins were a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen sometimes, but that's it. I eat just about anything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Do you want to know if I drink or smoke? I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I don't much care for it anymore. And I never smoked a day in my life. My wife hated smoking. I live alone now. Always have, really, even when I was married. I don’t have much family left.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll start with checking your vital signs, and then I’ll take a look at your hands and do a few neurological tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with, then. The sooner I’m done, the better. I have… things to do. Not important things, mind you, but still. Just… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 158/92. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm just going to take a look at your hands now. I notice a slight tremor in both hands, more prominent on the right. The tremor is present at rest and decreases with movement. Could you please extend your arms in front of you and touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. See? Not easy, is it? Always been a bit clumsy, I reckon. It’s getting worse, though. Used to be steadier.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is a slight difficulty with coordination. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I’d like to see you walk a few steps. Just a normal walk is fine. Okay, thank you, Mr. Jezik. That was helpful.
PATIENT: There. Not exactly graceful, is it? Used to be a much steadier walker. So, what do you think? What’s wrong with me, Doctor? Just tell me straight. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Based on the physical exam and your history, the findings are suggestive of Essential Tremor. The tremor in your hands, the difficulty with coordination, and the slightly wide-based gait are all consistent with this condition. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes, such as medication side effects or other neurological conditions. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to rule out any other underlying medical problems. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and to confirm the diagnosis. They may want to perform additional tests, such as a DaTscan, to assess the dopamine levels in your brain.
PATIENT: DaTscan? Sounds… complicated. And expensive. Look, Doctor, I’m an old man. I don’t want a lot of tests and scans. Is it serious? Is it going to… you know? Just tell me if it’s something I need to worry about. And if there’s anything I can do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly reasonable to want straightforward answers. Essential Tremor is generally not life-threatening. It's a progressive condition, meaning it can worsen over time, but the rate of progression varies significantly from person to person. Many people live full and active lives with Essential Tremor. As for what you can do about it, there are several treatment options available. These include medications to help control the tremor, lifestyle modifications such as reducing caffeine intake, and in some cases, surgery or deep brain stimulation. We won't rush into any treatment right away. First, we need to confirm the diagnosis with the neurologist. They can also discuss the best treatment options for you based on your individual needs and preferences. To start, I will order the blood tests. They will help rule out other causes of the tremor. I will also write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist I trust. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the referral?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… alright. Blood tests… fine. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And they don’t need a whole lot of blood. I get… faint, you see. So, this Ramirez… will they be able to tell me if it’s something I need to worry about? Honestly? Is it something that will… make me unable to do things? That’s what I’m worried about. I like to tinker in the garage, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns completely. Dr. Ramirez is excellent at explaining things clearly and will be able to answer all of your questions. The blood tests are fairly routine and don’t require a large amount of blood. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable during the process. As for your ability to tinker in the garage, that’s a very valid concern. Many people with Essential Tremor are able to continue pursuing their hobbies with some modifications. The neurologist can discuss strategies to help you manage the tremor and continue doing the things you enjoy. They may suggest assistive devices or techniques to help you stabilize your movements. It's important to remember that everyone experiences Essential Tremor differently. We will work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. I will give you a written order for the blood tests and the referral to Dr. Ramirez. The lab is located just down the street, and the receptionist will schedule an appointment for you with the neurologist. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all for now. Just… get it over with, then. The sooner I know, the better. And thank you, Doctor. For… not making me feel like a complete idiot. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you after your appointment with Dr. Ramirez. .
