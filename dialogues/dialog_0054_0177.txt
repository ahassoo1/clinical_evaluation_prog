DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I guess. Well, it’s… something embarrassing. A little problem. Down there. It's… leaking. Not a lot, but… it's there. It’s been happening for a few days now. I don’t know why it's happening. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright, Jimmi. These things happen, and there’s no need to feel embarrassed at all. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “leaking,” could you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… not like when you gotta pee, okay? It’s… wetter than usual. And… kinda sticky. And it smells… bad. Not always bad, but sometimes. It’s just… not right. I haven't been with anyone, if that matters. Not for a long, long time. It just started happening, I tell ya! I don't know what I did.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for explaining that, Jimmi. That’s helpful. And it’s good you mentioned that you haven't been sexually active recently. That information is important. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That's a long time ago. I… I think I had the measles when I was a little girl. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a mango tree. Does that count? I don’t go to the doctor much. Never have. Everything always… fixed itself, I guess. I don’t really remember anything serious. I live alone, if that matters. And I’m careful with what I eat. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It’s alright if you don’t remember everything. The measles and the broken arm are good to know, but we’re mainly looking for things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other ongoing health issues. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… Oh, now you’re using big words! Let me see… the old doctor, Dr. Reyes, he said my blood pressure was a little high once. A long time ago, when my sister passed. He gave me some pills, but they made me feel dizzy, so I stopped taking them. I don’t like taking pills. And… no, I don’t think I’ve been “diagnosed” with anything else. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Everything hurts a little these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Sometimes high blood pressure can contribute to these types of issues, so it’s helpful you mentioned that. And it's good you told me about the dizziness – we always want to avoid medications that cause unwanted side effects. Now, thinking about your family… Do you have any family members – mother, sisters, aunts – who have experienced similar problems, or have any medical conditions you are aware of?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, they all lived a long time. My mother… she was strong. Never got sick a day in her life, as far as I know. My sister, before she passed… she had children, lots of them. I don’t know what they got. We didn’t talk much about that kind of thing. Everyone just… kept to themselves. And my aunts… they all lived in the village. I haven’t seen them in years. I think one of them had… something with her stomach, maybe? But I really couldn’t say. It was a long, long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know much about my family’s health.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Jimmi. It’s common for people not to have a lot of that information. We can still proceed without it. Now, let's talk about your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I told you, I don’t like taking pills. I don't take anything. Never have. I drink a little chamomile tea sometimes, if I can’t sleep. But that’s it. And allergies… hmm. I get a little itchy sometimes, when the mosquitoes are bad. But that's just normal, right? Everyone gets itchy with the mosquitoes. I'm Chamorro, Doctor! We live with the mosquitoes! I've never been seriously allergic to anything. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications or known allergies. That simplifies things. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? What does that mean? You’re not going to… poke around too much, are you? I don't like being poked and prodded. I came here because something is wrong, not to be… examined. But… if you have to, I guess. Just be gentle, okay? And quick!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jimmi. I promise to be as gentle and quick as possible. It's a routine exam to help me figure out what's going on. We'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll just need to take a quick look at the area you're concerned about. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, let’s just sit back and I’ll take your blood pressure. It's a little elevated, 148 over 92. That's not drastically high, but it's something we'll want to monitor. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My sister always said doctors just like to worry people. Just… be quick, okay? And don't poke too hard. It’s… sensitive. I’m telling you, it’s very sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. We'll be very careful. Elevated blood pressure isn't necessarily bad, but it's something we want to keep an eye on and manage if needed. We can discuss that further after the exam. Now, I’m just going to take a look at the external area. I may gently palpate the area to get a better sense of what's going on. Please let me know if anything is painful or uncomfortable. I notice some mild redness and slight swelling. There doesn't appear to be any sign of injury or infection, but there is a noticeable discharge. The odor is faint at the moment, but I did detect it. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but these findings suggest possible vaginal irritation or infection.
PATIENT: Ouch! See? I told you it was sensitive! What does “vaginal irritation” even mean? Is that serious? And “discharge”… that sounds terrible. Is it something… catching? I don't want to catch anything! I live alone, you know. I don’t need any… troubles.
DOCTOR: I apologize for any discomfort, Jimmi. I’ll be even more gentle. “Vaginal irritation” simply means there’s some inflammation or discomfort in the vaginal area. It can be caused by a number of things – a change in pH balance, an infection, or even just sensitivity to a new soap. It's usually not serious, but it's important to figure out the cause. And “discharge” just refers to the fluid that comes from the vagina. It’s normal to have some discharge, but a change in color, consistency, or odor can indicate an infection. As for whether it's “catching,” it depends on the cause. Some infections are easily treated and not contagious, while others may require more care. To determine what's going on, I’d like to collect a sample for testing. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… sample? You mean… like pee? I don’t like giving samples! It's embarrassing! And what if it's something… bad? What if it's something serious? I don't want to know! I just want it to go away. Can’t you just give me a cream or something? Something to make it stop itching and smelling? I don’t want to be poked and prodded and have you… take things away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jimmi. It's perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable. A urine sample wouldn't be helpful in this case. The sample I'm referring to is a swab from the vaginal area to identify any bacteria or yeast causing the irritation. It’s a quick and simple procedure. Unfortunately, without knowing the cause, it's difficult to recommend the right treatment. Using a cream without knowing the cause could actually worsen the problem or mask the symptoms, making it harder to diagnose later. It is possible it is nothing serious. But we need to know what we are dealing with to make sure we treat it effectively. Would you be willing to consider the swab test?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But… be quick about it, okay? And… gentle. Very gentle. I don’t want any… pain. And don't tell me anything bad, okay? Just… fix it. I just want it to go away. And… can I have a glass of water after this? My mouth is all dry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. And yes, you can definitely have a glass of water afterwards. We’ll get this sorted out. Okay, all done. That was very quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, just… over with. Now what? Do I have to wait a long time for the results? And… is it going to hurt to walk? I have to go to the market later. I need to get mangoes. My favorite.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt to walk at all. And you don’t need to worry about that. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to process the results. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching or using any scented feminine hygiene products, as these can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina. To ensure there's no underlying issue, I also recommend getting a blood sugar test. The vaginal infections can be linked to diabetes in some cases, so it’s a good idea to rule that out. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood sugar? Now you’re talking about diabetes? I don’t have diabetes! My sister had that, it’s terrible. I eat healthy. Mostly. I don't want a blood test! That means needles, doesn’t it? I hate needles! No, Doctor. No blood test. Just… fix the leaking. That’s all I want. Can I at least have that glass of water now? My mouth is so dry, I can barely talk. And… can you write down a cream for the itching? Just in case. Before the results come back. Just something to soothe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand your concerns. I won’t push the blood test if you’re not comfortable with it. But I want you to know that it’s just a precaution to rule out any underlying issues. In the meantime, I can prescribe a topical cream to relieve the itching and discomfort. It’s a mild, over-the-counter anti-itch cream with a soothing agent. It won't cure the infection, but it should provide some relief while we wait for the lab results. Here you go. This is for a cream called Clotrimazole. You can find it at most pharmacies. Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice a day for a week. And yes, here's a glass of water. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: Clotrimazole… Okay. Is it expensive? I don’t have a lot of money, you know. My sister always said doctors just want to charge you a lot of money. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I hope it works. And… call me as soon as you get the results, okay? Don't make me wait too long. Mango season won't last forever, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jimmi. Clotrimazole is relatively inexpensive, usually around $10-$15. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, my priority is your health and well-being. I will definitely call you as soon as the results are available, I promise. And don’t worry about mango season – we'll get this sorted out so you can enjoy it. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Jimmi.
