DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, it’s… getting harder to do things. My legs, mostly. They just… feel weak. It’s been happening for a little while now, getting worse little by little. The other doctors… they say it’s this Multiple Sclerosis thing. I just want to know… what can we do about it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores. Weakness in the legs, progressively worsening… and you’ve been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. I understand you're looking for what our options are. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sudden thing. Not a pain, really. Just… when I try to walk, my legs feel heavy. Like I'm wading through water. Sometimes, they just… don’t want to move. And it’s worse when I’m tired. Or if it’s hot outside. Does that make sense? It’s… frustrating. I used to be very strong, you know? I was an athletic trainer for many years. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astores. “Heavy legs,” feeling like you’re wading through water, worse with fatigue and heat… that’s very helpful. And when did you first start noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about a year ago? At first, it was just a little bit of stumbling sometimes. I thought I was just getting old, you know? But then it started happening more and more often. And it got… harder to ignore. It was probably… six months ago that I really started to worry about it and went to the other doctors. They did some tests… and that’s when they told me about the Multiple Sclerosis.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a year ago with initial stumbling, progressing to the point of seeking medical attention six months ago and receiving the MS diagnosis. Now, aside from the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. There’s been… some trouble with my balance. I get dizzy sometimes, not all the time, but enough to make me nervous. And my vision… it’s a little blurry, mostly in one eye. It comes and goes. And… sometimes I feel very, very tired. More tired than just being old, you know? Like… exhausted, even after a good night’s sleep. Is that… is that part of it too?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Astores, that absolutely can be part of it. Balance issues, dizziness, blurry vision, and fatigue are all common symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. Now, regarding your vision, is the blurriness in one eye constant, or does it come and go as you mentioned?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not all the time. Some days I don’t even notice it. Other days… it’s like looking through a fog. Mostly just in my left eye, I think. And it usually… goes away after a little while. It’s never lasted for more than a day or two. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not painful, just… annoying. It makes it hard to read sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent blurry vision in the left eye, lasting no more than a day or two at a time. And it interferes with reading. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was playing football, but that healed up fine. Nothing else… not really. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, until this. Just the usual… colds and flu, you know? I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in many years. My wife takes care of me, makes sure I eat right. She's a good woman. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Astores. Appendectomy, broken arm… otherwise generally healthy. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… hmm. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had some trouble with her heart towards the end. My father, he was strong, a fisherman, but he died young in an accident. I have two brothers and one sister, they are all healthy as far as I know. Nobody else… that I know of… has had anything like this Multiple Sclerosis thing. But we don’t talk much, you know? Family is… scattered now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Astores. No family history of MS, mother with heart trouble, father who passed away young. Now, do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. The other doctors… they gave me something for the… spasms. My legs sometimes… twitch and jerk. It’s called… baclofen, I think? And I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for my back. Old age, you know? But that’s it. Just those two things. My wife keeps track of everything, makes sure I take the right pills at the right time. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, baclofen for spasms and ibuprofen as needed for back pain. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. My wife says I'm too stubborn to let anything bother me! But seriously, no allergies that I know of. I haven't had any trouble with medications before. I always tell the doctors if something doesn't feel right, though. She makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Astores. Thank you for providing all of this information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and balance. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to know what’s happening. I just… want to feel better. I used to be a strong man. I want to be able to do things again. So, yes. Please. Do whatever you need to do. Just tell me what’s going on, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. I understand. Alright, if you could sit up on the table for me, please. We'll start with your reflexes. Okay, let's start with your knees. Relax your legs for me. …Good, good. Now, ankles. Okay. Reflexes are… slightly diminished bilaterally, but within normal limits. Now, let's check your strength. Can you resist me as I push down on your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. Okay. Push down, you said? Alright. I’ll try my best. It's… a little harder than it used to be, but I’ll try. Just let me know what you want me to do. I’m a little worried… I don’t want to fall. My wife would be so upset.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astores. I'll be right here to support you. Okay, just try to push back against my hands. Don't strain yourself. Just do what you can. …Alright. And now the other leg. …Okay. Strength is… 4/5 in both legs, meaning you have good, but not full, strength. Now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Eyes closed, you said? Okay, here we go. It’s… harder than it looks. My hand… it’s not very steady. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I’m trying my best. It’s just… this Multiple Sclerosis thing is… strange. Everything feels… off. My wife says I’m getting forgetful too, but I don’t remember!
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Astores. It is challenging, and you’re doing perfectly fine. The slight difficulty with coordination is consistent with what we’ve discussed. Now, let's check your balance. Could you stand up for me, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can try. Okay… here I am. But please, hold my arm, just in case. I don’t want to fall down. It’s… embarrassing, you know? I used to be so strong and steady. Now… I feel like an old man. My wife… she worries about me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. I’m right here. Okay, just stand still for a moment. …Okay. Your balance is slightly impaired, with some swaying, but you’re maintaining your position. Alright, Mr. Astores. That’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a little scary, but I’m glad it’s over. What did you find? Is it… bad? What does this Multiple Sclerosis thing mean? Will I… end up in a wheelchair? My wife… she’s so worried about me. I just want to know what’s going to happen. Please, tell me the truth. Even if it’s… not good.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astores, I understand your concerns, and you deserve honest answers. The exam findings – slightly diminished reflexes, 4/5 strength in your legs, and some balance impairment – are consistent with Multiple Sclerosis. It's important to remember that MS presents differently in everyone. As for what it means, MS is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms you’re experiencing – weakness, fatigue, vision changes, balance problems – are caused by the immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers. Will you end up in a wheelchair?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s what I’m most afraid of. Will I end up in a wheelchair? My wife… she wouldn’t be able to handle it. She takes such good care of me already. Is that what’s going to happen? Please, tell me the truth. I can handle it. I just need to know. I need to plan. We need to plan.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astores, it’s a very valid concern, and I appreciate you asking directly. It's unlikely you will end up completely reliant on a wheelchair. However, it’s also important to be realistic. MS can progress at different rates for different people. Some individuals experience mild symptoms with minimal disability, while others may experience more significant challenges with mobility and function. The good news is that there are disease-modifying therapies available that can help slow the progression of MS and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. These medications work by suppressing the immune system to prevent further damage to the nerve fibers. Given your current level of symptoms, I recommend a referral to a neurologist specializing in MS. They will perform further testing, such as an MRI of your brain and spinal cord, to assess the extent of the disease activity and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for you. They can also discuss the potential benefits and risks of these medications and help you make an informed decision about your care. In the meantime, physical therapy can help maintain your strength, balance, and coordination, and occupational therapy can help you adapt to any functional limitations you may experience. We can also discuss strategies for managing your fatigue and other symptoms. Would you like me to schedule that referral to a neurologist for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Schedule the referral. I need to see a specialist. I need to know what my options are. And… what can I do to slow it down? What can we do to slow it down? I want to stay strong for as long as possible. My wife… she deserves that. And… is there anything I should be doing now? Any exercises? Any foods I should eat? Anything at all? I’m willing to do anything. Please, tell me what I can do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. I completely understand your desire to take an active role in your care. Let’s discuss what you can do now. I will get the referral to a neurologist scheduled for you right away. In the meantime: Regarding exercise: Gentle, regular exercise is beneficial, but it's important to avoid overexertion, which can worsen symptoms. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, and yoga are good options. Physical therapy can provide you with a personalized exercise program tailored to your specific needs and limitations. Regarding diet: There's no specific diet proven to cure MS, but a healthy, balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is recommended. Some studies suggest that a Mediterranean diet may be beneficial, but more research is needed. It’s also important to stay hydrated and maintain a healthy weight. Other recommendations: Vitamin D supplementation: Many people with MS are deficient in Vitamin D. Your doctor can check your levels and recommend appropriate supplementation. Stress management: Stress can exacerbate MS symptoms. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help manage stress. Avoid smoking: Smoking has been linked to increased MS disease activity and progression. Rest: Ensure you get adequate rest and avoid overexertion. I am also going to write a prescription for a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in neurological conditions. They can provide a comprehensive evaluation and design a personalized exercise program for you. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on MS, such as websites and support groups?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Resources would be very helpful. Websites, support groups… anything that can help me understand this better. And… thank you. Thank you for listening. Thank you for being honest. I was so scared. But… I feel a little bit better now. Knowing that there are things I can do… that makes a difference. My wife will be relieved too. She’s been so worried about me. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance and guidance. It's completely understandable to be scared, and it's good that you're taking an active role in your health.

I will also have my nurse provide you with some local support group information before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. And… I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll make an appointment with the neurologist, and I’ll start looking into the physical therapy. And… I’ll tell my wife. She’ll want to know. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Remember, you’re not alone in this. I wish you all the best on your journey. Take care, and have a good day.
