DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Carla. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me crazy, really. Just…itchy all over.
DOCTOR: I see. Itchy skin can be very bothersome, Carla. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it is! It’s mostly on my arms and back, I think. And my legs a little bit. It doesn't really seem to be…well, there’s no rash, not really. Just…dryness and itchiness. It's worse at night, definitely. Makes it hard to sleep. I’ve been using lotion, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily on your arms, back, and legs, with no significant rash, but dryness and itchiness that’s worse at night. And the lotion isn’t providing much relief. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…oh, maybe a month or so ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten steadily worse over the last couple of weeks, especially. I thought it was just the summer heat, you know? But it’s still bad even when it’s cooler.
DOCTOR: A month ago, starting mildly and progressively worsening, even with cooler temperatures. Okay. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better – anything at all that provides some relief, even temporarily?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm…well, sometimes if I take a really cool shower, it feels a little better for a bit. Just for a little while, though. And…I don't know if this matters, but I’ve been a little more stressed lately. My grandson is going off to college, and I’m a bit worried about him. He’s a good boy, but…it’s a big change for both of us.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Carla. A cool shower providing temporary relief, and increased stress with your grandson going off to college. Stress can certainly contribute to skin issues. Now, let’s get a bit more of a complete picture. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the itchiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No fever, no weight loss, no tiredness more than usual. And no pain, definitely not. Just…the itchiness. Oh! Sometimes my skin feels a little…rough, like sandpaper, but that’s about it. I haven’t noticed anything else. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. No fever, weight loss, fatigue, or pain, just the itchiness and some rough skin texture. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… Let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it's under control now. I take a little pill for it every day. Other than that… no, not really. No diabetes, no thyroid problems, nothing like that. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every morning, and I eat pretty well. I don't think I've ever had anything seriously wrong with me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Carla. High blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and otherwise generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s an easy one! No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything… never had a reaction. I’m not afraid of much, really. Not even needles!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see…I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, maybe…forty years? Something like that. It didn’t bother me much. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago too. Other than that, no surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal a long time ago and a wrist fracture. And you mentioned you take a pill for your blood pressure. What is the name of that medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The names…they all run together, you know? Let me see if I can remember… It’s a small white pill… starts with an ‘A’, I think? Amlodipine? Is that right? Amlodipine Besylate. Yes, that’s it! Amlodipine Besylate. I take 5 milligrams every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine Besylate 5 milligrams daily for your blood pressure. That’s very helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives—parents, siblings, or children—have similar skin conditions, or any history of allergies or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm… Family history. Well, my mother had a little eczema when she was a girl, but she grew out of it, I think. And my brother has hay fever, terrible hay fever every spring. But no one else, not that I know of, had anything like this itchy skin. No autoimmune diseases, no nothing. My family is pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, some childhood eczema in your mother and hay fever in your brother. That’s good to know. Finally, before I do a quick exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…what do you mean exactly? Do you want to know about what I eat? Or how much I sleep? Or…oh! Do you want to know if I smoke or drink? Because I don’t. Never have, never will. I like to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: No, you've understood perfectly. I just want a general idea of your daily routine and any potential exposures. Do you use any new soaps, lotions, detergents, or cleaning products?
PATIENT: Oh! Good question! Let me think… I switched laundry detergents a couple of months ago. I used to use that Tide stuff, but it got so expensive! So I switched to… Gain, I think? The one with the pretty smell? I haven’t changed anything else, not really. Same soaps, same lotions…well, except for trying different ones for this itchiness, of course! But nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: Alright, change in laundry detergent to Gain a couple of months ago. That's potentially relevant. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. I just want this itchiness to go away! It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carla. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 140 over 90. We can discuss that later. More importantly, I do see some dryness and evidence of scratching on your arms and back. There’s no rash, which is helpful. Your skin doesn’t appear inflamed, but it is definitely irritated. Based on everything you’ve told me and what I’ve found on examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing dry skin exacerbated by a possible mild irritant contact dermatitis – potentially from the new laundry detergent, or even stress. However, given the duration and your discomfort, we should rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying medical causes for the itchiness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests…well, I’m not crazy about needles, but if it will help, I suppose I can manage. Thyroid function, you say? That sounds…serious. Is it something to worry about? And you think it could be the laundry detergent? I knew I should have just stuck with the Tide! It's just…everything is so expensive these days. But yes, go ahead with the tests. If it will help me figure out what's going on, I’m willing to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: It's good you're willing to proceed with the tests, Carla. Thyroid problems are common, and easily treatable if we catch them early. We're just being thorough, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’ll check a few levels, and then we can discuss the results. The laundry detergent is just one possibility. It’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of itchiness. We’ll also consider other factors like stress and the natural dryness that can come with age. I'll write an order for a complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone , and a basic metabolic panel. You can have those drawn at the lab down the hall. They’ll need a small blood sample. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, I recommend stopping use of the Gain laundry detergent and switching back to something you've used before without issue. I’d also suggest using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day – even after bathing. And try to manage your stress as best you can. Easier said than done, I know. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, well, stopping the detergent makes sense. And I do have some of that Aveeno lotion, the one for sensitive skin. That should be okay, right? Aveeno is pretty gentle. And I’ll try to relax, but with my grandson leaving…it’s hard! He’s always been such a good boy, and I worry about him being on his own. But yes, I think I understand. Tests, stop the detergent, use the Aveeno lotion, and try to relax. Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor? Should I be watching for any specific symptoms while I wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, Aveeno for sensitive skin is a good choice, Carla. As for symptoms to watch for, please let me know if you develop any fever, rash, swelling, or significant fatigue. If the itchiness becomes unbearable or spreads rapidly, come back to see me right away. But otherwise, we’ll just wait for the lab results, which should be back in a few days. The lab will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with me. I’m also going to provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the test orders. It includes information about managing dry skin and a list of local resources for stress management. Do you have any questions about the testing process or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. A written summary is good, that way I won’t forget anything. And thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. I know I ramble on sometimes. And thank you for not making me feel silly about the itchy skin. It’s just so annoying! I guess I’ll go get the tests done then. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. It’s my job to listen and help you find answers. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, don’t feel silly about the itchiness. It can be incredibly disruptive to your quality of life, and we're taking it seriously. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
