DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, I… I asked to come in to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was time.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… proactive of you. And perfectly alright. Before we proceed with any testing, I need to understand a little bit about why you’re wanting to be tested now, specifically. It helps me assess your risk factors and ensure we’re doing the right things. Can you tell me a little about your concerns?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a bit difficult to talk about, honestly. My husband and I… we haven’t always been the most careful, if you understand me. And lately, I’ve just been feeling a little anxious. I don't have any symptoms, not that I’m aware of, but I'd just have peace of mind knowing one way or the other. It’s been weighing on my thoughts, you see.
DOCTOR: “Not careful,” is… vague, Ms. Shaub. To properly assess your risk, I need specifics. When you say not careful, are we talking about unprotected intercourse?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… that is what I mean. Unprotected intercourse. It happened… a few times, over the years. It wasn’t a regular thing, but it has happened. And now, with everything going on… I just want to be sure. I haven’t been with anyone else, only my husband, but… one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: Right. And when was the last time this occurred?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… oh, goodness, it must have been about six months ago, perhaps a little more. It wasn’t recent, thankfully. We talked about it afterward and… decided to be more mindful, let's say. But that’s why I’m here now, to be certain everything is alright. Six months… yes, I believe that's correct.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’ve noticed. I feel… well, I feel my age, if you understand. A little tired sometimes, a few aches and pains, but nothing unusual for a woman my age. No fever, no rash, no swollen glands… just the usual wear and tear, really. I've been generally healthy, as far as I know. I eat well, mostly, and try to get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s all. It's a small dose, and I've been on it for years. No allergies to penicillin, no reactions to any other medicines I've ever taken. Just the blood pressure medication, really. It’s… amlodipine, I think it's called.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any past medical history?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, many years ago, but I recovered well. And I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, but that was many decades ago. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Nothing major, really. I've generally been quite lucky with my health, all things considered. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything else, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother passed away from heart disease, sadly. And my father had diabetes. I don’t believe anyone else in my immediate family had any major illnesses. My siblings are still alive and reasonably healthy, as far as I know. They have the usual aches and pains, but nothing serious. So, heart disease and diabetes are the main things, on my mother and father’s side. It’s something I try to be mindful of, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Shaub, I'm going to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It’s standard procedure. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your lymph nodes, and a quick examination of your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, please do. I understand it’s standard procedure, and I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. I’ll just… loosen my dress a little bit. I appreciate you taking the time to do this so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up on the table, please. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Lymph nodes are…slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged. And now, I'll just take a quick look at your skin. No visible rashes or lesions. Skin appears normal. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Everything seems… within reasonable limits, considering your age and history.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. The murmur… is that something I should be worried about? I haven’t been told about a murmur before. And the blood pressure… is that something we should address right away? I try to keep an active lifestyle, but perhaps it’s not enough. I do get a little stressed sometimes, you see.
DOCTOR: The murmur is likely benign, Ms. Shaub. Many people have innocent murmurs that don't require any treatment. But we’ll monitor it. As for your blood pressure, 140/90 is above the target range. We should certainly address it. It’s not an emergency, but it does need to be managed. First, we’ll repeat the blood pressure reading a few times today, just to confirm. Then, we can discuss lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress reduction. If that’s not enough, we may need to adjust your medication. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. First, we'll get the HIV test results back. That's the primary reason you're here today.
PATIENT: Yes, you are absolutely right, Doctor. The test results are the most important thing. I get anxious thinking about it, to be honest. It’s silly, I know, I should just wait for the results, but… It’s good to know you’re keeping an eye on my blood pressure, though. And I’m happy to discuss lifestyle changes. Perhaps cutting back on salt would help? My husband loves to cook, but he does tend to use a lot of it. So, what happens next with the test? How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: We've already taken a blood sample. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to return the results, so you should have them by the end of the week. We'll call you with the results – do you have a preferred number?
PATIENT: Yes, please call me at 555-123-4567. That’s my mobile number. And… what if the results are positive? What would happen then? I suppose I should be prepared for that possibility. It’s just… a little frightening to think about.
DOCTOR: If the results are positive, Ms. Shaub, we’ll discuss treatment options immediately. HIV is a manageable condition these days with antiretroviral therapy. It’s not a death sentence. You’d need to see an infectious disease specialist for ongoing care, and we’d help you with that referral. We’ll also discuss partner notification, which is…important. But let’s not dwell on hypotheticals. We'll deal with that if and when it arises. Right now, let’s focus on getting the results back. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. That’s… everything, I suppose. Thank you for being so thorough, even if you are… direct. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things, even the difficult parts. I'll just wait for the phone call, then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. We’ll be in touch.
