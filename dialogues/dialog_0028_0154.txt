DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my water. It keeps bothering me. Again. I think it's the same trouble I had before, but honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It just…hurts when I go. Is that enough information? I’d like to get this sorted quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Right. “Hurts when you go.” Okay. And when was the last time you had this “trouble,” as you call it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It was… sometime this year, definitely. Not long ago, but…was it spring? Or maybe summer? I really can’t be sure. A few months, I suppose. It comes and goes, you see. It’s very inconvenient. I don't remember exactly when it started this time. It all feels like a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: A few months… right. And can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s…a burning. A sort of stinging, right down there. And it feels like I have to go all the time, even when I don’t. It’s uncomfortable, to say the least. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually, just…a persistent ache and that burning feeling. It’s hard to explain. I just wish it would stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Definitely. If I drink coffee… or tea, actually, any caffeine... it seems to make it much, much worse. And…um… if I have to hold it for too long, that’s bad too. I try to go when I need to, but you know, sometimes it’s not possible. It’s very irritating. I'm not sure if that helps. I try not to drink too much liquid, thinking that might help, but it doesn’t always.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any unusual discharge?
PATIENT: Oh…blood? No, not that I recall. I haven’t looked specifically, to be honest. I just notice the discomfort. And discharge…no, I don't think so. I really wouldn't know what to look for, Doctor. I try not to worry about the details if I can help it. It’s just…the burning is the main thing. Is that…bad? Should I be looking for something? I get flustered easily when it comes to these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any fever, chills, or back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no chills. Definitely not. And my back…well, I’m 66 years old, Doctor. My back always hurts a little! It's just old age, I suspect. Not a sudden pain, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and creaks. I don’t think that’s related to…this problem. It's just…everything hurts a bit at my age, you know? I wouldn't know if it was worse than usual, honestly. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. Well, no, not currently. I was married for a very long time, but… we divorced many years ago. And I haven't… been with anyone since. It's been a very long time. Is that…relevant? I don’t understand why you’re asking. I just want this burning to stop, you know? It’s very embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Oh dear. Well, I suppose so. But please be quick, Doctor. I have a hair appointment this afternoon, and I really mustn’t be late. It's just…I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you understand. Is it going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It will be quick. Just need to rule a few things out. Please lie on your back with your knees bent. I’ll need to examine your abdomen and then do a quick pelvic exam. I’ll explain what I'm doing as I go.
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? Goodness me. Well, I suppose. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And… do explain everything, as you said. I get very anxious about these things. I’m not used to this sort of thing. And… really, as quickly as possible, please. My hair appointment… .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. Lie back, please. I'm going to palpate your abdomen first. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Anything here?
