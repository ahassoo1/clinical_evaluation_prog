DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Honestly? It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but a friend suggested I come in and ask about… that PrEP thing. You know, to help prevent HIV. I’m getting a little older, and… well, it seems sensible to be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. It's not embarrassing at all to be proactive about your health, and frankly, it’s very sensible. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a great option for HIV prevention, and you're right to explore it. It's becoming increasingly common, and we see patients of all ages. To make sure it's a good fit for you, I'll need to ask you a few questions, if that's alright. First, can you tell me a bit about your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm glad you say that, because I was a little worried about… everything. Um… sexual activity. Right. Well, I’m single, haven’t been with anyone long-term in… a long time. But I do date, and… occasionally have casual encounters. Nothing regular, but it happens. I just want to be safe, you know? Is that enough information? I don’t really like talking about this, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina, that’s perfectly enough information to start with. You don’t need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing it's occasional encounters is helpful. To assess if PrEP is appropriate, we need to rule out any current HIV infection and check your kidney function, as that's important for the medication. Also, we'll need to discuss safe sex practices. Before we get into that, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not to anything major, no. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain lotions, but that’s it. Oh! And penicillin. I had a bad reaction to it when I was a kid – hives, the whole thing. But that was decades ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the penicillin allergy – yes, that's important. We'll definitely avoid that. And the lotion sensitivity isn’t a concern for PrEP. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… just my blood pressure medicine, Lisinopril. I've been on that for maybe ten years now. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Oh, and a multivitamin, every other day or so. That's it, really. I try to eat well, so I don't take a lot of supplements.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, occasional ibuprofen, and a multivitamin. Thank you. That's very helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture of your health, have you had any serious medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed when I was in my thirties, and… I broke my wrist a few years back. Nothing else major, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. No diabetes, no heart problems… nothing like that. I try to stay active, walk a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture. That’s good to know. And it’s excellent that you’re staying active. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she had some heart trouble later in life. And my father… he had diabetes. He wasn't very good about taking care of himself. My sister is healthy as a horse, though, thankfully. That's about it, I think. We didn’t really talk about health a lot growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hypertension and diabetes. That’s helpful information. Now, before we talk about the physical part of things, I just want to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never have. Tried it once when I was a teenager, hated it. My father smoked for years, and it nearly killed him. I’m very anti-smoking. And I barely drink, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very good to hear. Okay, Helaina, that gives me a good overview. Before we discuss PrEP further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief check of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Let's get it over with. I’m ready when you are. I just want to know if this is something that’s even possible for me, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's do it. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal so far. I'm going to check your reflexes and a quick neurological assessment, just routine. Reflexes are normal, no neurological deficits. Do you have any current symptoms - anything you've been experiencing lately that's bothering you?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I think. And my knees ache when it rains, but that’s it. Nothing major. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age. Just… cautious.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and achy knees – that’s common. Nothing that seems concerning at the moment. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, PrEP does seem like a reasonable option for you. Before we start, though, we do need to run some blood tests to confirm you’re not currently infected with HIV, check your kidney function, and assess your overall health. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Let's do it. I'm ready to get this sorted out. The sooner the better, honestly. I just want to know I’m being sensible and taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Helaina. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll write up the lab order now. It’ll be a standard blood draw, and we should have the results back in a few days. Okay, I've ordered the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, HIV test, and STI screening. We’ll also want to repeat the HIV test in three months, as it takes time for the virus to become detectable. Once we have the results, we can discuss the medication options, potential side effects, and the importance of regular follow-up visits. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Three months for a repeat test… okay. I can definitely do that. Honestly, it's a relief to finally be getting this done. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not at the moment, I think. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m sure I’ll think of something once I get home and have a chance to process everything. Is there anything I need to do before my next appointment, besides, you know, try not to get any new partners?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question! And yes, practicing safe sex is important. No, nothing specific besides avoiding risky behavior and remembering to schedule your three-month follow-up. We’ll also discuss adherence to the medication when we see you again – it's very important to take it consistently for it to be effective. Here’s a handout with information about PrEP, safe sex practices, and a list of resources. Do you have any work or school requirements for medical notes?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I used to work for the school district, but I'm retired now. Just my own business to run, and it doesn’t require anything like that. I appreciate you asking, though. I think that’s everything. Really, thank you, Doctor Rosanova. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I’ll see you in a few days with your results. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Thank you again.
