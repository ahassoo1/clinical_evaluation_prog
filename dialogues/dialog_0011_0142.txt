DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 22 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Good to meet you too, Doc. Right… what brings me in. It’s… my head. It’s been giving me trouble. Bad trouble, sometimes. And… I get kinda sweaty, and my heart races with it. I don’t really… know how to explain it very well, to be honest. It just happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unsettling when symptoms come on without a clear explanation. We'll work through it together. Let's start with the headaches. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Um, okay. They’re… they’re just really bad. Like, a really strong pressure, all over my head, kinda. Not just one spot. And sometimes it feels like… like something’s tightening around my skull. It's hard to describe, really. It comes on quick, usually. Not always, but a lot of the time. And like I said, with the sweating and the fast heartbeat. It feels… awful. How long do they usually last? Honestly, I kinda lose track. A while, I guess. A few hours, maybe? It's all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so thoroughly. "A few hours" is helpful. And you mentioned it comes on quickly – is there anything that you’ve noticed before a headache starts?
PATIENT: Before? Hmm… not really. That’s the weird thing. It just… is. Sometimes I'm just sitting there, and then BAM. Headache. Sometimes I'm moving around, sometimes I'm not. Doesn't seem to matter much. I wish I knew what brought them on, I really do. It’s just… random, I think. Is that… helpful? I feel like I’m not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly well, Mr. Lawther. It's often difficult to pinpoint the cause, and the fact that it seems random is important information. Let's explore some other symptoms. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… yeah, sometimes. Not every time, but definitely a few times. I haven’t actually thrown up, if that makes sense. Just… really queasy. Like I might, but it never actually happens. And… blurry vision, I think? Or maybe that’s just part of the headache. Everything gets a bit… fuzzy when it’s bad. It’s all kinda mixed up in my head. It’s hard to keep track of what goes with what, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely; it sounds very disruptive. Blurry vision with the headache is something we need to note. Now, thinking beyond the headaches themselves, have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Sleep… not really. I mean, I don’t sleep great ever, but nothing’s changed much lately. I usually get… six, maybe seven hours? I toss and turn a bit, but I always have. I don’t wake up feeling particularly tired, or anything. I used to work a lot of different shifts, so I guess I kinda got used to not having a regular sleep schedule. Is that important? I'm not sure what you're looking for.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. An irregular sleep schedule can sometimes contribute to headaches, so it’s good to know. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, anxiety, or depression?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I haven’t really… been to the doctor much. Not since I was a kid, I guess. I had the usual stuff, chickenpox and all that, but nothing serious. I was divorced a couple of years ago… it was rough, but I don't think that made me ill, if that makes any sense? I haven't been told I have anything, like, officially. No high blood pressure or anything. Just… the headaches. And a bit stressed sometimes. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful. Stress certainly can contribute to headaches. And the divorce being a recent stressor is important information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Like I said, I'm not really a doctor person. I just kinda… deal with things. I broke my arm when I was little, but that was just a cast. Nothing major. The headaches are the first proper… thing, you know? The first time I’ve really felt like I needed to come see someone. I’m probably not very helpful, am I? I don't remember a lot.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Lawther. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have a detailed medical history; we’re building it together. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives, such as your parents or siblings, suffer from headaches, migraines, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… my mum gets headaches sometimes, yeah. Not as bad as mine, I don't think. Just… normal headaches, like everyone gets. She doesn’t really talk about it much. And my dad… he was alright, I think. Nothing I can remember, anyway. He passed away a few years ago. I don't think he suffered from headaches. I don't really know my siblings that well, we're not close. So… maybe my mum. Just normal headaches, though. Nothing like this. Is that… useful?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… I used to drink a bit, yeah. Mostly just on weekends. But I’ve kinda… stopped, really. Not much point, is there? And no, no smoking or anything like that. Never really been into any of that. Not even much caffeine, really. Just… a cup of tea in the morning, sometimes. Nothing major. I'm not much of a… lifestyle person, I guess. Just work and… try to keep my head above water.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not at all. I haven’t taken anything for the headaches, actually. I just… tried to sleep it off, mostly. Or just… waited for it to go away. I don’t really like taking pills, if you know what I mean. Not insured, so... expensive, too. Yeah, no meds. Never been much of a meds person.
DOCTOR: I understand. Being without insurance can make things difficult. Alright, Mr. Lawther, I've asked a lot of questions, and I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… good. That sounds good. I’d like to know what’s going on, if you know what I mean. Check everything, yeah. I just want to… feel normal again. Do what you need to do, Doc. Just let me know if anything’s… wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Lawther, everything appears normal on the initial exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we’ll need to monitor. But neurologically, I don’t see anything concerning at this time. Given your history of recurrent headaches with associated nausea and occasional blurry vision, and the lack of any focal neurological deficits, the most likely possibility at this stage is tension-type headaches, possibly with some migraine features. However, given your blood pressure reading, and to rule out any underlying secondary causes, I'd like to order some basic blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work… yeah, okay. That sounds… sensible. If it helps find out what's going on, then yeah, definitely. I don't really understand all the… terms, but if you think it's a good idea, then I trust you. So… blood work, then? Will it be expensive? And… what if it is something serious? I don’t want to get too worried. Just… tell me what I need to know, yeah?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. The blood work is to help rule out other potential causes of your headaches, such as infection, anemia, or thyroid problems. It’s a precautionary measure. The cost will depend on the lab, but I can provide you with a requisition form and you can inquire about pricing beforehand. We’ll also discuss payment options if needed. As for the possibility of something serious, while it's important to be prepared, the most likely cause is still a primary headache disorder, which is often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. We will go over the results carefully when they come back, and I will explain everything to you in detail. In the meantime, I recommend trying to manage your stress levels, staying well-hydrated, and getting adequate sleep. I can also suggest some over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if you’re comfortable with those. Would you like me to write you a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Okay… stress, water, sleep. Right. I can try. It’s just… hard sometimes. And pain relievers… yeah, okay. If you think it’ll help. I don’t really want to be relying on pills, but… I need to get back to work, and I can’t do that with a headache. So… ibuprofen, is it? Anything I need to be careful about? I haven’t taken anything in ages. And thank you, Doc. For… not laughing at me. I feel like I’m making a mess of this.
DOCTOR: You’re not making a mess of anything at all, Mr. Lawther. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when dealing with new symptoms. Ibuprofen is a good option. As long as you don’t have any allergies to NSAIDs, or a history of stomach ulcers, kidney problems, or heart disease, it should be safe to take. Start with 400mg every 4-6 hours as needed, and don't exceed 1200mg in a day. Always take it with food to minimize stomach upset. I’ll write you a prescription and a requisition form for the blood work. I also want to monitor your blood pressure in a week or two to see if it has come down. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for that. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Ibuprofen, blood work, check blood pressure in a week. Got it. And a follow-up appointment. Yeah, that’s good. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you… explaining everything. And for not making me feel… stupid. I think… I think that’s everything? Do I need to do anything else? Just… pick up the prescription and go get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. It’s my job to help you understand what’s going on and to make you feel comfortable. Yes, that’s correct. Pick up the prescription from the pharmacy, and then go to the lab to get the blood work done. The results will typically be available within a few days, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ve also printed out a patient information sheet with details about tension-type headaches and some helpful resources. Here you are. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doc. Really. You’ve… put my mind at ease a bit. I’ll go get the blood work done and pick up the prescription. And I’ll schedule a follow-up. Have a good day. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I'm glad I could help. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. You have a good day as well.
