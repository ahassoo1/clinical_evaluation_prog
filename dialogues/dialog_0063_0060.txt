DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It's…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. Lots of…problems. Heart stuff, mostly, but also some other things. I just want to be sure I'm not heading down the same path, you know? Preventative, that's what I'm going for. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, preventative care is… sensible. Though, frankly, obsessing over family history often leads to unnecessary anxiety. Still. Heart issues, you say?
PATIENT: Unnecessary anxiety? With all due respect, Doctor, it’s not obsessing if you’re trying to avoid a… a premature end. My uncle died at 58. Fifty-eight! And my grandmother, she was barely functioning for the last ten years of her life. So, yes, heart issues. And diabetes. It runs in the family, too. It’s not exactly a calm situation. Are you going to, you know, do something about it, or just…talk about my anxiety levels?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's not dwell on hypotheticals. I need specifics. Do you have any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. That’s the point, isn’t it? I feel fine. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I eat reasonably well, I suppose. I wouldn’t say I exercise religiously, but I'm not a complete couch potato either. Honestly, I just want a checkup, a baseline. Maybe some blood work. Just to be sure. I don't need a lecture on lifestyle changes if everything’s…normal.
DOCTOR: "Reasonably well" is hardly a clinical assessment, Mr. Theriot. And "a little tired" can be indicative of…many things. Very well. I will order a standard metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a lipid panel. However, given your stated concerns about family history, I think a precautionary EKG is warranted as well. It’s…prudent.
PATIENT: An EKG? Is that really necessary? It just seems…excessive. I mean, if my blood work comes back fine, what's the point? It's just going to add to the bill, isn't it? I have Medicare, Doctor, it’s not like I can just keep racking up charges for every little worry. Honestly, it feels like you're already assuming something’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Medicare covers necessary procedures, Mr. Theriot. And an EKG is a basic diagnostic tool. It is not "assuming something is wrong", it is being…thorough. Given your family history, I find it irresponsible not to perform one. Are you refusing the procedure?
PATIENT: Refusing? No, I’m not refusing. It just…seems a bit dramatic, that's all. Fine, do the EKG. But if it comes back normal, I expect a full explanation of why it was even necessary in the first place. And I don't want to be talked down to about anxiety levels or lifestyle choices. Clear? I just want information, not a lecture.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will document your…preferences. The technician will be in shortly to perform the EKG. In the meantime, let’s review your medical history. Have you been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never been hospitalized. Not even for anything minor. I’ve always been… relatively healthy. A few colds, the usual childhood things, but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that's about it. Really. I’m not a frequent visitor to doctors’ offices, if that matters. Is this going to take long? I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No major surgeries, then?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Never needed anything like that. I'm… fairly careful. Look, is there a reason you're asking all these questions? I feel like you're looking for something to be wrong. Just trying to be sure I understand. I mean, I came here for a preventative checkup, not an investigation. Do you think I just want to be sick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, you are being… unnecessarily apprehensive. I am simply gathering information. It is standard procedure. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I know of. I’ve taken antibiotics, painkillers… the usual stuff when I’ve been sick. Never had a reaction. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm under interrogation here. I’ve answered all your questions, told you my medical history, and now you're practically accusing me of something. It's a bit much, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us move on to your family history. You mentioned heart issues and diabetes. Can you be more specific about which relatives were affected and at what age?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. We’ve already covered this. My mother’s father had heart disease, he was diagnosed in his early sixties. He died at seventy-two. Her sister had type 2 diabetes, diagnosed around fifty, she’s…still alive, but not doing well. My uncle, on my mother’s side too, died of a heart attack at fifty-eight. It's all in the initial paperwork, Doctor! Are you even reading it? I feel like I’m repeating myself. Is there any point in continuing this if you haven’t even bothered to review my file?
DOCTOR: The paperwork provides a skeletal overview. I require specifics. Were these relatives smokers?
PATIENT: Smokers? Honestly, I don't know! My grandfather smoked a pipe, I think. My aunt…maybe? It was a long time ago, Doctor. I wasn't keeping track of their habits as a child! I just know they had these health problems. It's not like I have a detailed medical history chart for my entire extended family! Are you expecting me to be a doctor myself? This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a checkup, not a family reunion investigation.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us conclude with your social history. Do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Now we're on to my drinking habits? Is there no end to this? Fine. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Maybe two, if it’s a special occasion. I don't drink every day, Doctor, and I certainly don't have a problem. Is that what you’re insinuating? I came here for preventative care, not a character assessment. I'm starting to regret even making this appointment. Is this standard practice with you?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure to gather a comprehensive history, Mr. Theriot. Now, do you use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: .
