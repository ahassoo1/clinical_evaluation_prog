DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning. Dr. Stilaire, right? Look, honestly, it’s a bit… fuzzy. Something about not sleeping so well, and feeling a bit…off. My wife, bless her, she always said I needed to… well, never mind. Something about getting fitter, I suppose. It was on a leaflet, I think? Honestly, I don’t remember the specifics. It’s all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing some difficulty with sleep and a general feeling of being unwell – a bit "off," as you put it. And it seems this visit may have been prompted by a suggestion to improve your overall fitness?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. Fitness… she was always on about fitness. I don’t really do fitness. More of a… listener, you know? I fix instruments. People bring me their guitars, their ouds… I don’t run around. It’s probably all connected, isn’t it? Not enough… activity. Though, to be fair, the instruments keep my hands busy enough. A very precise job, it is.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you have a very skilled and detailed profession. And you're right, a lack of physical activity can contribute to feeling unwell and having trouble sleeping. However, we need to explore all possibilities. To help me get a clearer picture of what's going on, let's start with your sleep. When did you first begin noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice…? That's a tricky one. It’s been… gradual, I think. Since… well, since she passed, probably. Everything sort of blurred around that time. Maybe six months? A year? I really couldn’t say for sure. It's not like I keep a diary. I just know I don't feel… rested when I wake up. And I toss and turn a lot, apparently. My neighbour mentioned it. Old Mrs. Henderson. A bit of a busybody, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Redfern. It's completely understandable that a significant life event such as the loss of your wife would impact your sleep. Grief can manifest in many ways. And Mrs. Henderson's observation is helpful. So, this difficulty with sleep has been present for approximately six months to a year, and you don't feel rested upon waking. Aside from not feeling rested, are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Hmm. Well, I’ve been a bit… sluggish, I suppose. Low energy. Not much motivation to… do anything, really. Used to enjoy restoring old instruments, really get lost in the work. Now… it feels like a chore. And my appetite's been off. Don’t really feel hungry much of the time. Though, to be honest, I haven't been cooking much either. Mostly just… toast. It’s easy. Does that count as a symptom? I also get a bit… forgetful, but then again, that’s always been me, hasn’t it? My wife used to say I could forget my own name.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That's all very helpful. So, you've noticed a decrease in energy, a loss of motivation, decreased appetite, and some forgetfulness. It sounds like these symptoms have developed gradually alongside the sleep difficulties. To get a more comprehensive picture, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. Not much, really. Had the usual childhood stuff - measles, mumps… nothing serious. When I was younger, I broke my wrist, fixing a particularly stubborn tuning peg. Silly thing, really. And… well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. It’s controlled with medication, I think. A little white pill. I take it every morning, I think. Honestly, I'm not always the best at remembering things. Mrs. Henderson reminds me sometimes, actually. She’s very… observant. It all feels a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. It’s good to know about the high blood pressure and that you're taking medication for it. And don’t worry about the occasional forgetfulness; it’s understandable. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking something. The name… It's a little white pill, like I said. Small, round… I think it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘B’? Honestly, I have no idea. I just take it. The pharmacist sorts it out for me every month. I don’t really pay attention to the names of things. Instruments, yes. Pills… not so much. Sorry, I’m really not much help with that, am I?
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Redfern. We can certainly look up the medication list in your electronic health record. No need to worry. Now, aside from the high blood pressure, have you ever been hospitalized for any other reason or undergone any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… No, not really. Nothing major. I had a bit of a scare when I was a teenager, tripped and fell while climbing a fig tree. Broke a few ribs, but they healed on their own. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a bit unpleasant, I recall. But other than that… no. Nothing serious. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises. I’m not really one for… medical interventions, you see? I prefer to fix things myself, if possible. Like my instruments.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That gives me a clearer picture of your surgical history. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a bit tricky. My father… he passed away when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. And my mother… she lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I believe. Badly affected her hands. She was a seamstress, very talented. Couldn't work towards the end. As for siblings… I had a sister, but we lost touch years ago. She moved to Australia, I think. Haven’t heard from her in… goodness, decades. It’s all a bit… fragmented, you see? I'm not very good at keeping track of things. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That’s very helpful, despite the fragmented nature of the information. It's understandable that it's difficult to recall details. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, what exactly do you mean? I live alone, as you probably gathered. Since my wife… I don’t really go out much. Used to enjoy going to concerts, listening to music… but it’s not the same without her. I spend most of my time in my workshop, fixing instruments. It keeps me busy, I suppose. I don’t have many friends… a few acquaintances, mostly people who bring me their instruments for repair. I don’t drink… or smoke. Never really had the inclination. Not much of a social life, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you’ve experienced a significant loss and are coping with it by focusing on your work. That’s perfectly understandable. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never really had any reactions to anything. I’ve always been quite careful about what I eat, mostly simple foods. I don’t go in for fancy things. And as for medications… well, I only take that little white pill for my blood pressure. Never had any problems with it. Although… Now that you mention it, sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy after I’ve been working on old instruments. Especially if they’re covered in varnish. But I don’t think it’s an allergy, exactly. More of an irritation, I suppose. Sorry, I’m probably not much help with this either. It's all rather… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That’s all very helpful. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: A physical examination… Alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not really one for poking and prodding, but… if it will help. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m a bit of a sensitive soul, you see. And… try not to take too long, if possible? I have a few instruments waiting for repair. Let's get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Redfern. I’ll be as gentle as possible and we won’t take long. First, let’s just take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. …148 over 92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, if you'll just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, though a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you open your mouth for me and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Ah… Is everything alright, doctor? You seem to be… listening for a long time. And what was that about a murmur? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I don't like the sound of murmurs… My wife always said I worried too much. She was right, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. Your throat looks clear. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your ears. …Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. As for the murmur, it’s a very faint one. It’s not necessarily cause for concern, but it's something we should investigate further. It's common for murmurs to develop with age, and many are harmless. However, to be on the safe side, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. This is a simple, non-invasive test.
PATIENT: An electrocardiogram… That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine? I'm not really one for… procedures, you see. My wife always handled the medical stuff. She knew what questions to ask, what tests were necessary. I just… fixed things. Instruments. That's what I do. Is it absolutely necessary, doctor? I mean, I've been feeling a bit sluggish, yes, and I don't sleep very well, but… I manage. I always have. Perhaps a bit of rest is all I need? Or a new mattress?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Redfern. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned about unnecessary tests. And you’re right, sometimes rest and lifestyle changes are all that’s needed. However, given your history of high blood pressure and the presence of a murmur, an EKG is a relatively simple way to rule out any underlying heart issues. It will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and allow us to make a more informed decision about your care. The cost is typically covered by Medicare, and we can certainly verify your coverage before proceeding. The test itself is quick and painless. It involves placing a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. Think of it as a preventative measure, Mr. Redfern. Just to make sure everything is as it should be. We can also discuss your sleep difficulties and explore potential lifestyle changes in the meantime. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Medicare, you say? That's… reassuring. And preventative… I suppose that makes sense. My wife always said it was better to be safe than sorry. Alright, doctor. If it's covered by Medicare and it's just a preventative measure… I suppose I can agree to the electrocardiogram. But please, be gentle. And don’t keep me too long. I have a violin waiting for new strings. And a cello that needs a bit of tuning. So, what happens next?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Redfern. I’m glad we could agree. Now, the nurse will come in shortly to take your vital signs again and then take you to the EKG room. It will only take about 10-15 minutes. After the test, you can come back here, and we'll discuss the results and create a plan to address your sleep difficulties and general feeling of being unwell. In the meantime, I'm going to order some blood work as well. It's a routine checkup to assess your overall health. We'll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It will also help us understand if there's a potential vitamin deficiency contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Blood work and an electrocardiogram… It’s a bit much, isn’t it? I’m not really one for poking and prodding, as you know. But… alright. If it’s necessary. Vitamin deficiency… That’s interesting. My wife always made sure I ate a balanced diet. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Perhaps I haven’t been eating as well since… well, you know. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just… please, be gentle. And try not to keep me too long. I have instruments waiting, you see. A lot of instruments. So… I just wait for the nurse now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Redfern. Just wait here, and the nurse will be with you shortly. She will explain the process for both tests in detail. And I assure you, we will do everything we can to make you comfortable. I’ll be right here when you get back, and we’ll discuss everything. In the meantime, try to relax. And thank you for your patience and cooperation.
