DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I am Dr. Hembrey. I see you're here today for a consultation. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, I coughed up some blood. It… it scared me a little, so I thought I should come get it checked. It was a few days ago, and it happened again this morning. Not a lot, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers. Coughing up blood – even a small amount – is certainly something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, let’s start with some details. When you say "a few days ago," can you be more specific about the date?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… Tuesday, I believe. August 1st. Yes, that’s right. Tuesday. And then again, like I said, this morning, August 2nd. Is that helpful? I’m not very good with dates usually.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And can you describe the blood itself?
PATIENT: Um… it wasn't… bright red. More… darker? Like… old pennies, maybe? And it wasn’t a lot, Doctor. Mostly it was mixed with my spit, you know? Not like… a full cough of just blood. It just… appeared with the mucus. Is that… a good description? I’m sorry, I don’t know how to explain it well.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Weichers. You're describing it just fine. "Old pennies" is a very useful descriptor, thank you. And the fact that it was mixed with mucus is important. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the coughing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have been a little tired lately. But I thought that was just… being older. And maybe a little short of breath sometimes when I walk up the stairs, but nothing bad. No fever, no chills, no chest pain. I haven't lost any weight that I know of. Does that… help? I feel a little silly listing everything.
DOCTOR: It’s important to be thorough, Ms. Weichers. Please don't feel silly. Fatigue and mild shortness of breath are relevant. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, my husband… he passed away last year. And I've had high blood pressure for a few years, but it's controlled with medicine. Just a small pill every day. Other than that… not really. I haven't had any major illnesses. Oh! I had the flu shot last winter. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood pressure is important, and good for you for keeping up with it. And the flu shot is helpful information as well. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. Never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. I don't like hospitals much, so I try to avoid them. I suppose that’s why I waited a few days to come in this time.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Weichers. We will strive to be as efficient as possible. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mother, she had… something with her lungs. I think it was… emphysema? She smoked a lot, and she was very sick for a long time before she passed. My father, he was healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. Does that help? I’m not sure I remember everything very well. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Emphysema is important information, thank you. And that's perfectly alright if you don’t recall every detail. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't smoke. My husband used to, but he stopped many years ago. I always told him it was terrible for him. And I’ve never been around it much, either. I prefer fresh air.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just sometimes, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a small beer on the weekend. Nothing… regular. I don't drink much, I promise. It doesn’t agree with me very well.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I don’t have any allergies. I eat almost anything. My husband used to tease me about my cast iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. Is that all the questions?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Weichers, that seems to be all the questions for now. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. It will involve listening to your lungs and heart, and I may need to take your temperature and blood pressure again. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Weichers. I will be as gentle as possible. Please take a seat back, and take a deep breath for me. Alright, let's listen to your lungs. Take slow, deep breaths in and out… Good. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in the lower lobes, bilaterally. Not particularly alarming, but something we need to investigate further. Your heart sounds regular, rate and rhythm are within normal limits. No murmurs detected. Blood pressure is 138/82, a little elevated, but not drastically so. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, within normal range. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Alright, Ms. Weichers. Based on your history and this brief examination, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An X-ray… that sounds… serious. Is it something really bad, Doctor? I understand you need to find out what’s happening, but I always worry about those things. And a blood count… will that tell you a lot? I’m just a little scared, I suppose. It's been a long time since I’ve been to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, I understand your apprehension. It's natural to be concerned when something unusual is happening with your health. However, an X-ray and a blood count are standard diagnostic procedures. They are not necessarily indicative of something serious. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any potential issues, such as pneumonia or other structural abnormalities. The blood count will assess your overall health and help us determine if there is an infection or other underlying cause for your symptoms. We are simply gathering information at this point. It’s far more prudent to investigate this now, rather than allow it to potentially worsen. Do you have any further questions about the procedures themselves?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. You just want to be sure. That makes sense. Will the X-ray… will it hurt? And will I have to wait a long time for the results? I have a book club meeting on Thursday, and I promised to bring the cookies. It's very important.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is completely painless, Ms. Weichers. You'll simply stand or sit in front of a machine for a few moments while an image is taken. As for the results, we typically receive them within 24-48 hours. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. We should have them well before your book club meeting. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased coughing, fever, or shortness of breath – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and… patient with me. It's been a while since I’ve had to worry about things like this. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’m still a little scared, but I feel better knowing what’s happening.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Weichers. It’s my duty to ensure you receive the best possible care. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the X-ray. She will also provide you with detailed instructions. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them further. Do not hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, Ms. Weichers. And enjoy your book club meeting.
