DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, definitely. It's been going on for a little while now, but it's becoming quite disruptive, to be honest. I'm not entirely sure why, and I… I don’t recall exactly when it started, just that it’s been a few weeks, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's definitely worth looking into if it's disrupting your life. “A lot” can mean different things to different people, so could you give me a rough idea of how many times a day you’re going, compared to what’s normal for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. Normally… perhaps three or four times a day? Something like that. But lately… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more. It's hard to say precisely. I haven’t been keeping a strict count, I apologize. It just feels… excessive. And often it’s just a small amount, if that makes sense. Not a large volume each time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significantly more frequent than usual, even if it’s small amounts each time. That’s helpful to know. And is it just more frequent, or have you noticed any changes in how you feel when you need to go?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question too. Hmm. I don’t think so, not really. It doesn’t hurt when I go, and there’s no burning sensation or anything like that. It just… feels like I need to go more often, and the urge comes on rather suddenly, sometimes. It's not a gradual feeling, if you understand. It’s more like a quick need. I don’t feel like I completely empty my bladder each time, either, but… I could be wrong. It’s all a bit muddled, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning, sudden urges, and feeling like you don't fully empty your bladder. Got it. To get a better picture, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine itself? Oh. Now that you mention it… I suppose it has been a little cloudy sometimes. Not always, but occasionally. And… perhaps a slightly stronger odor than usual? But I don’t know if that’s just me being… overly sensitive. I really haven't paid much attention, I'm afraid. It's all rather subtle, if it’s anything at all. I don’t think I’ve seen any blood, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, cloudy urine and a slightly stronger odor. That’s good information. Now, just to rule some things out, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, definitely not. And no lower back pain either. I’ve been feeling generally well, aside from this… bathroom issue. Just tired, perhaps, but that’s not unusual for me. I do have a rather demanding job, you see. Concierge work keeps one on one's feet! But no aches or pains beyond the usual fatigue, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. Well, I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts. As for actual illnesses… I had a bout of bronchitis when I was younger, and… I think I had the flu once. Nothing major, honestly. I haven’t been to a doctor in quite a while, I'm afraid. I tend to avoid them if possible. No chronic conditions, no. I don’t take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions or regular medications. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don't believe so. Nothing that I recall, at least. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was young, but that was a very long time ago, and it wasn't a particularly serious procedure. Nothing else, no. I'm fairly certain of that. I’d remember something significant, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you absolutely would. Okay, and what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… That’s… a difficult question. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to my father. I don’t really have much information about their medical history, I’m afraid. They weren’t the sort to discuss such things. As far as I know, they didn’t have any major health problems, but… I couldn't say for certain. I don’t recall any instances of, say, kidney problems or anything like that, but… it’s all very vague. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it's not always easy to recall family history. Okay, lastly, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all, thankfully. I've never had any reactions to anything. Food, medications, nothing. I can eat whatever I like, and I haven’t had any problems with skin sensitivities or anything like that. I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. Okay, Keoni, based on what you've told me – the increased frequency, the small amounts, no pain, cloudy urine, and no known medical history – it sounds like we should investigate a possible urinary tract infection, or UTI, or potentially just some bladder irritation. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and checking a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then please do. A UTI… that doesn’t sound very pleasant. I suppose it’s best to find out one way or another. Listening to my abdomen and a urine sample… yes, that’s perfectly alright. Just… please be gentle. I'm not fond of medical examinations, if I'm honest. But I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to see if there’s any tenderness. Then we’ll collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so… just… how long will it take to get the results of the urine sample? And… is it usually something serious? I apologize, I’m rather anxious about all of this. I’ve never really been one for doctors’ visits.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. The urine sample will take a few minutes to analyze in the lab. We should have the results within about 15-20 minutes. As for how serious it is, most UTIs are easily treated with antibiotics. However, if left untreated, they can become more serious and spread to the kidneys, so it's important to get it checked out. But, again, that’s not typical, and we're being proactive by checking now. Okay?
PATIENT: Fifteen to twenty minutes… that’s not too bad. And antibiotics… that sounds manageable. Thank you for explaining that, Doctor. It does make me feel a bit better, knowing it’s usually treatable. Yes, okay. Let’s proceed then. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Great. I’m just going to press lightly here and listen to see if there’s any discomfort or tenderness. Take deep breaths, and let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, nothing alarming there, just a little bit of normal sensitivity. Now, I’m going to need you to collect a urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom, and I’ve given instructions to the nurse on how to get a clean catch sample. I'll explain it again, but it's important to try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample about halfway through. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A mid-stream sample… yes, I think I understand. Start, then collect halfway through. It’s just… will I need to… clean myself first? And how much urine do I need to collect? I apologize for all the questions, I’m just trying to get it right. I don't want to have to repeat the process if I don't do it properly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, it's good to ask! Yes, please clean the area with the wipes provided before you begin. That helps to prevent contamination. As for how much, just a couple of ounces – about a half-cup is fine. Don’t try to force it, just a comfortable amount. And yes, it's important to get a clean sample, so don't hesitate to ask the nurse if you need another set of wipes. Take your time, and let me know when you’re finished. The bathroom is just down the hall to your left.
PATIENT: Alright. Clean the area, halfway through, about half a cup… I think I’ve got it. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I’ll go now.
DOCTOR: Take your time. I'll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Here you are. I… I hope I did it correctly. It was a bit awkward, to be honest, but I followed the instructions as best I could. Is this enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, this looks perfect, thank you! It's a good amount and it appears clean. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. While we’re waiting for the results, do you have any other symptoms you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so. No fever, chills, or pain, as we discussed. No nausea or vomiting, either. I suppose… I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, but as I said, that’s not uncommon for me. And… maybe a slight headache, but it's very mild. Nothing I’d normally bother a doctor about. Just… general fatigue, perhaps. It’s probably just stress from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild fatigue and headache. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but it’s good to know. Alright, the lab results should be back in about ten minutes. While we’re waiting, let’s just quickly review your medications again, just to be sure. You haven't taken any over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, or anything like that recently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I rarely take any medication at all, Doctor. I prefer to avoid it if possible. No over-the-counter painkillers, no herbal teas, nothing. I haven't changed my routine at all recently, aside from… well, needing to go to the bathroom more frequently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That simplifies things. Alright, the results are back. It appears you do have a UTI – a urinary tract infection. The lab detected bacteria in your urine. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like it’s spread beyond your bladder, which is good news. We can treat it with antibiotics. Would you be comfortable taking a course of antibiotics?
PATIENT: A UTI… well, that explains things, I suppose. Antibiotics… yes, I suppose so. If it's the best course of action, then please do. I’ve always been a little wary of antibiotics, but if it will get rid of the infection, then I trust your judgement, Doctor. What sort of side effects should I expect? And how long will the treatment last? I’d like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The most common side effects are mild – nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. Some people experience a yeast infection, especially women, but we can address that if it happens. It's important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. We'll prescribe a 7-day course of Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day with food. Alongside the antibiotics, it's crucial to drink plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day – to help flush out the infection. Also, try to urinate frequently, even if you don’t feel a strong urge. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, as we discussed, no allergies at all. Nitrofurantoin… I haven’t taken that before, but I haven't had any adverse reactions to medication in the past. Seven days… twice a day with food. Plenty of fluids and frequent urination. I think I can manage that. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Or any warning signs I should look out for? I’d like to be as informed as possible. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. The most important warning signs to look out for are fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine. If you experience any of those, stop taking the antibiotics and contact me immediately. It’s also important to know that antibiotics can sometimes interact with other medications, but since you’re not taking any, that's not a concern here. And, just a reminder, even after you finish the antibiotics, it’s good to continue drinking plenty of fluids to help prevent future infections. I’ll send the prescription to your local pharmacy. Do you have any preferences for which pharmacy you’d like me to use?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have a specific preference, Doctor. Just… whichever pharmacy is closest to my home would be fine. I live on… well, it doesn't matter. Any pharmacy nearby would be convenient. I appreciate you offering. I think that covers everything, doesn’t it? Thank you again for your help, Doctor. I feel much better knowing what's going on and how to treat it. I’ll be sure to follow your instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe that does cover everything. I’ll send the prescription over now. The nurse will give you a discharge instruction sheet with all the information we discussed, just as a reminder. I also want to remind you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to ensure the infection has cleared. You can schedule that with the receptionist on your way out. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. A follow-up appointment in one week… yes, I’ll remember to schedule that with the receptionist. You’ve been very thorough and helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I think I'm all set. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Feel better, Keoni. And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. Have a good day! .
