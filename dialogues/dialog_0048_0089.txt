DOCTOR: Right. Alese Glymph, 62. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Sink. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part, mostly. It’s been hurting again, quite severely at times. I do apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be, so I can't recall precisely when it started this time. I believe it’s been a few weeks, though. They tell me I have… something with the immune system? Lupus, is it? It complicates things, I’m told.
DOCTOR: Lupus… yes, I see here a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It can certainly complicate matters. A few weeks of lower abdominal pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Not a steady ache, thankfully. It’s more… waves, I think. Bad days, then a few hours or even a day where it's manageable. But when it is bad, it’s quite debilitating. Hard to describe, really. A cramping, twisting sort of feeling. And… is debilitating a proper word, Doctor? I sometimes struggle with phrasing.
DOCTOR: Debilitating is… acceptable. It means it significantly interferes with your daily activities, yes. Waves of cramping and twisting pain… and where exactly in the lower abdomen are you feeling this?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I’m glad it’s an acceptable word. It’s… difficult to pinpoint. Mostly in the center, I think, but sometimes it feels like it radiates to both sides. And… down a little lower, towards… well, you understand. It’s not a localized pain, if that makes any sense. It feels… widespread, even when it’s concentrated in one area.
DOCTOR: Widespread… Right. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a very good question. Trigger… hmm. That’s difficult. I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. I eat fairly simply, I try to stay active, though the heat does make that harder, of course. I suppose… stress, perhaps? I do worry about my grandchildren quite a bit. And sometimes, after a long journey, though I can’t recall if that’s connected. It just… happens. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Stress is… a common factor. But given your lupus, we need to rule out other possibilities. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my… Well, Doctor, I do apologize, that's rather personal. Let me see… Not drastically, no. Perhaps a little… slower, at times? And sometimes… not as complete, if you understand. It’s never been a major issue, though. Certainly nothing that would alarm me, before this pain started. It could just be… old age, perhaps? I do try to drink plenty of water, though.
DOCTOR: Right. And any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood? No, no, not that I’ve noticed. Certainly nothing obvious. I… I would remember something like that, I think. I do check, just in case, but… no. Definitely not. It's just… the pain is what worries me. The other things… well, those seem like minor inconveniences, compared to that. I hope I'm not being difficult, Doctor. I just wish I could give you a clearer answer.
DOCTOR: No, no. I’ll need to examine you. Lie back on the examination table, please. We'll start with palpation of your abdomen. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Palpation… yes. I shall try to relax. It’s just… I never much enjoy being poked and prodded, if you don't mind my saying so. But I trust your judgement completely. Please, do whatever you need to do. Just… gently, if you would be so kind?
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little, Doctor. Not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. Here, on the left side, mostly. And… perhaps a little lower, in the center. It's not a sharp pain, more like… a pressure, building up. Are you feeling anything, Doctor? I worry I'm making this difficult.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling some… tenderness in the left lower quadrant, as you’ve indicated. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Bowel sounds are present, albeit a little sluggish. Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. Sluggish… that doesn't sound promising, does it? I do apologize for being such a complicated patient. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, that much is certain. My granddaughter keeps telling me I need to rest, but I always worry about leaving things undone. Is everything alright so far, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Heart and lungs sound clear. Everything seems… stable. Given your history of lupus, and these symptoms… it could be a flare-up. But given the lower abdominal pain, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We'll also need to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. A flare-up… that sounds unpleasant. And tests… yes, of course. Anything to help determine what’s wrong. Infection… I hadn’t considered that. It all sounds… quite serious, doesn't it? Are you worried, Doctor? I trust your judgement completely, you understand. I just… I do prefer to know what I'm facing, if at all possible. Will these tests require a long visit? I do have a luncheon planned with my sister… a very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Glymph. Not necessarily serious, just thorough. The lab work shouldn’t take long – perhaps an hour. We'll get the results back this afternoon. I wouldn’t alarm yourself prematurely. As for your luncheon… I’m sure you can reschedule, if necessary. We need to prioritize your health. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan. .
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. Reschedule the luncheon, then. It was a particularly nice restaurant… but my health is, of course, more important. A particularly nice restaurant. I do hope it wasn't too much trouble to change things. Please, call me if anything… concerning arises. And thank you, Doctor, for your time and patience.
