DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart... it feels a little funny with it. Been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a bit longer. I just thought it would clear up on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: I see. A cough that’s persisted for a couple of weeks, and you’ve noticed some heart palpitations associated with it. That certainly warrants a closer look. To start, could you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It’s… not a dry cough, exactly. There's a little something with it, you know? Like a little phlegm. Not a lot, but enough to make me feel like I need to clear my throat. And sometimes, especially when I lie down, it feels… heavier. Like it’s coming from deep down in my chest. I don't cough up blood, though, if that's what you're thinking. I remember my mama always said a little phlegm was normal with a cold, but this isn't just a cold, is it? It feels… different.
DOCTOR: No, it sounds like more than just a common cold, Ms. Sadhu. Thank you for that detailed description. “A little phlegm,” coming from deep in the chest and feeling heavier when lying down… that gives me some helpful information. And you mentioned your heart feels “funny” with the cough. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not pain, Doctor. It's more like… fluttering. Like a little bird trapped in my chest, trying to get out. And sometimes, when I cough a lot, it feels like it skips a beat. It doesn't last long, just a second or two, but it's enough to make me stop and catch my breath. My husband – God rest his soul – he had something like that with his heart. That’s why I worry, you know? He had to take pills for it, and I… well, I don't want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Sadhu, especially given your husband’s history. “Fluttering” and feeling like your heart “skips a beat” are important symptoms. We'll certainly investigate that thoroughly. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had a fever or chills associated with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not a bit. And no chills either. I've been taking my temperature every morning, just to be sure. It's been normal, right around 98.6. I get a little warm sometimes when I'm cooking, of course – that kitchen gets hot! – but that's just from the stove. Not a sickness fever. I also haven't been feeling tired tired, you know? Just… a little worn out from coughing, that’s all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no fever or chills, and just feeling worn out from the coughing itself. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s… not all the time. But when I walk up the stairs, or even just walk to the mailbox, I get a little winded. I have to stop and catch my breath more than I used to. I used to be able to walk everywhere, you know? But now… it feels like my lungs aren't filling up all the way. Especially when I’m lying flat. I have to prop myself up with pillows to breathe easier. It’s worse at night, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion – stairs, walking – and worsening when lying flat, requiring pillows. That’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Well, my doctor – Dr. Ramirez, before he retired – he told me a few years back that I had some… congestion in my heart. He said it wasn't bad bad, but that I had to watch my salt and fluids. He called it… heart failure, I think? But he put me on some water pills and told me to take it easy. I've been taking those pills ever since, religiously. I also had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when my children were little, but I recovered from that. And my knees, they bother me something awful, but that’s just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. "Congestion in the heart," diagnosed as heart failure, and treated with water pills. That’s very important to know. And a history of pneumonia. Do you recall the name of the water pill you are taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… Dr. Ramirez, he wrote it on a little white slip of paper. I still have the bottle, though! Here it is. Furosemide. Yes, that’s it. Furosemide. I take one every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if I feel a little swollen in my ankles, he tells me to take an extra half. I usually fill it at the pharmacy down the street, Mr. Henderson’s place. He’s a good man, very helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Furosemide. I see you're taking it as prescribed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life, and never had a reaction. Dr. Ramirez asked me that when he first started treating me, and I told him the same thing. No allergies to penicillin, or anything like that. I'm not allergic to any flowers, either. My garden is full of them! I do get a little itchy sometimes when I touch certain plants, but that's just a little rash, nothing serious. Doesn’t bother me much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama always said they were bad for you, and she was right about everything. My husband, he tried them once when he was a young man, before we met, but he quit right away. He said they made him feel sick. We both always lived a clean life, as much as we could. I do enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's just for enjoyment, nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No smoking history, and only occasional wine. Now, Ms. Sadhu, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and look at your ankles for any swelling. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My heart has been a little funny lately, so listening to it sounds like a good idea. And my ankles have been a little swollen, especially in the evenings. Don't be shy, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu. If you could please take a deep breath for me. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I hear a murmur. It’s faint, but present. I also hear some crackling sounds in your lungs, mostly at the bottom of both sides. This can indicate fluid buildup. And as you mentioned, there’s noticeable swelling in your ankles, and it’s pitting edema—meaning it leaves an indentation when I press on it. Your blood pressure is 150/90. That’s a little elevated. Based on the exam findings—irregular heart rhythm, murmur, crackling in your lungs, ankle swelling, and elevated blood pressure—it sounds like your heart failure may be worsening, and there could also be some fluid buildup in your lungs. We need to investigate this further. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Worsening heart failure… I was afraid of something like that. My ankles have been puffier than usual, and I have been feeling more winded lately. Yes, Doctor, please do the X-ray and the EKG. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on and what we can do about it. I trust your judgment, you know? You seem like a very knowledgeable doctor. And, if you don’t mind, could you explain what the X-ray and EKG will show, just so I know what to expect?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sadhu. It’s understandable to be concerned. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart. It can show us if there is fluid buildup in your lungs—which would explain the crackling sounds I heard and your shortness of breath—and the size and shape of your heart. The EKG—or electrocardiogram—records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us identify any irregularities in your heart rhythm, and can give us information about whether you've had a heart attack in the past, or if there’s any damage to your heart muscle. I’m going to have my nurse draw some blood for a few routine labs as well, including a complete blood count and a BNP, which is a blood test that can help us assess the severity of your heart failure. I'll have the results sent to me as quickly as possible, and we’ll discuss them in detail as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to slightly increase your dose of Furosemide, and I'd like you to follow a low-sodium diet. I can provide you with a handout outlining the best foods to eat and avoid. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. More Furosemide and a low-sodium diet… I can do that. I remember Dr. Ramirez talking about salt being bad for my heart. A handout would be wonderful, thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little less worried, knowing what we’re looking for. And thank you for listening to me. It’s… it’s nice to have a doctor who takes the time to really hear what’s going on. When can I expect to hear back about the results? And where should I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. It’s my pleasure, and I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic—we have a radiology department just down the hall. My nurse, Maria, will arrange for that to be done after this consultation. The lab results and the X-ray report usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have my office call you as soon as I have them, to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what we’re going to do about it. Thank you again for taking such good care of me. And please, tell Maria to just call me Nadene. I suppose I’ll go see Maria now, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nadene. It was a pleasure meeting you as well, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Maria will be right with you. Have a good day. .
