DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about my speech, I suppose. It’s been… a bit off lately. Slurred, they said. Honestly, I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just that people have mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. “A bit off,” and some slurring. That's a good place to start. And you said people have mentioned it – do you recall roughly when they first brought it to your attention?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s difficult. It feels like… a few weeks, maybe? Possibly longer. I’ve been quite busy with work, managing the construction sites, you see, and things sort of… blur together. My wife mentioned it, I think, before I really noticed it myself. But pinpointing a date… I’m afraid I couldn’t say.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – life gets hectic, and it's easy to lose track of time. A few weeks is helpful, though. And it was your wife who first noticed it. Has the slurring been constant over those few weeks, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, it’s more pronounced. Like this morning, for example. I don't know if it's worse when I'm tired, or stressed… I haven't really been able to connect it to anything specific, to be honest. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent slurring, potentially related to fatigue or stress, but not consistently. That’s useful information. Besides the slurring, have you noticed any other changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Sometimes… it feels like I’m having trouble finding the right words. Not often, but… it’s happened. Like, the word is there, I know it, but it takes a moment to come out. It's frustrating, mostly. And… I don’t know if this is related, but I’ve been feeling a little more clumsy than usual. Dropped a hammer the other day, which isn't like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty finding words occasionally, and some increased clumsiness. That's good you're noticing these things. Let's talk a little more broadly. Have you experienced any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’ve noticed. I’m on my feet all day at the construction sites, walking around, climbing ladders… I haven’t had any trouble with that, or felt any weakness. Everything feels… normal in that regard. Although, now that you mention it, my hands have been a bit shaky sometimes. But I thought that was just from drinking too much coffee!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the strength. And the shakiness could certainly be from the coffee. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you had any headaches, vision changes, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing severe, just a mild ache, usually at the end of the day. Vision… no, I don’t think so. I wear glasses, you see, but my prescription hasn’t changed recently. And difficulty swallowing… no, not that I’m aware of. Everything goes down normally. I enjoy a good meal, and haven’t had any trouble with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild headaches, no vision changes, and no difficulty swallowing. That’s helpful. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, of course, for routine check-ups. But I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much over the years. My wife handles most of that sort of thing, to be honest. She might know more details if you need to ask. I don't really keep track of medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can always reach out to your wife if needed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I might have had my tonsils out when I was a child, but it was a long time ago, and I don’t have a clear memory of it. Hospitalized… perhaps for a bout of flu when I was young? Again, it’s quite vague. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid serious illness, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as stroke, heart disease, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult one, Doctor. My family… we don’t really talk about medical things much. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don’t recall any specific illnesses she had. My father is still alive, but he lives in Jamaica, and we don’t see each other often. He’s generally healthy, as far as I know. I believe he had high blood pressure at some point, but I'm not sure. It's not something that was discussed in detail, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited information on family history. That’s alright, we can work with that. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I keep busy with work, you see, and don’t really have time for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past. I’ve occasionally taken over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, and haven’t had any issues with those. I don’t have any food allergies either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam to assess your neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Everything looks clear in your ears. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements and reflexes. Follow my finger with your eyes, and try not to blink. Good. Your eye movements seem normal. Now, I’m going to check your facial strength. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Now, can you frown?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that sufficient? It feels a little strange, concentrating on it like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, can you puff out your cheeks?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I hope I’m doing it correctly. It’s a bit… awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your facial muscles seem symmetrical. Now, I’m going to check your tongue. Can you stick your tongue out for me?
PATIENT: Is that alright, Doctor? It feels a little silly, but I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, your tongue appears normal. Now, I'm going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that tight enough, Doctor? I don't want to hurt you.
DOCTOR: Good. And now, can you push against my hands with your feet?
PATIENT: Is that sufficient, Doctor? I’m trying to push as hard as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, your strength seems normal in all extremities. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Based on the physical exam, everything appears relatively normal. However, the intermittent slurring and difficulty finding words are concerning, and we need to investigate further. I’d like to order a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Also, I’ll order blood tests to check for any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests. Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. If that’s what you think is best, then please proceed. I trust your judgement. I just… hope everything is okay. It’s unsettling to think there might be something wrong, even if I can’t quite put my finger on it. When would I be able to schedule those tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Adyn. It’s always unsettling when something doesn’t feel right. We’re just being thorough to rule out any serious causes. I’ll have my nurse schedule the MRI and blood tests for you today. The MRI facility is located at St. Jude's Hospital, about 20 minutes from here. They'll contact you directly to confirm the appointment time. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic, first thing tomorrow morning. Once the results are back – typically within a week – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you notice any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased slurring, weakness, dizziness, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. St. Jude’s Hospital… and blood tests tomorrow morning. I’ll make a note of that. And I’ll be sure to watch for any worsening of symptoms. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to have a plan, even if it’s a little concerning. Is there anything else I should be doing or preparing for in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. For now, there’s no specific preparation needed. Just try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. It’s also a good idea to bring a list of any medications you’ve taken recently to your follow-up appointment, even over-the-counter ones. And please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule the tests and provide you with a printed summary of our discussion. Do you have any final questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I truly appreciate your time and attention. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll see you at the follow-up. Please take care of yourself. .
