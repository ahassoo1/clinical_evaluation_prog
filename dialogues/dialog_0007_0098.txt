DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, welcome in. I'm Valerie. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Valerie. Thanks for having me. Uh, well, to be honest, I just… wanted to check things out. Never really had a doctor before, not a regular one anyway. Just curious, I guess. See what everything looks like, you know? Make sure nothin’ is too messed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, Demondre. A wellness check is always a good idea. It's smart to establish a baseline, especially if you haven't had regular care before. I see you're 25, and the chart has your height and weight listed as 6'0" and 180lbs, is that correct?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s about right. Six foot, around 180. Maybe a little less these days, I been workin' hard on the boats. It kinda takes it outta ya, you know? Lots of lifting and movin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Physical labor can definitely impact things. To get a good overview, let's start with a little bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I mean, work is work, so I’m always a little sore, a little tired. But nothin' I can't push through. No real sicknesses or nothin' like that. Just... normal aches and pains, I guess. Been sleepin' okay, eatin' okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's reassuring. When you say "eating okay", could you tell me a little bit about what a typical day of meals looks like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it kinda depends. On the boat, it’s usually whatever the cook makes. That can be good sometimes, sometimes… not so much. When I'm home, I try to make somethin' simple. Eggs, toast. Maybe some chicken and rice. I like fruit when I can get it. Not a huge eater, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Uh, not that I know of. Never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, bugs sometimes when I'm on the boat, but that's just… bugs. Not like a food allergy or somethin'. I don't take any medicines, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies or medications. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of any significant health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. Didn’t really talk about that stuff much with my folks. My grandma on my mom's side… she had somethin’ with her heart, I think. But I don’t know what kinda somethin’. And my uncle… he had high blood pressure, I think. But that's about all I know, really. They weren't big on goin' to the doctor either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Knowing a little is better than nothing. So, to recap, generally feeling well, no known allergies or medications, limited family medical history. Now, just to get a more complete picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, things like that. Would that work?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I ain’t got nothin’ to hide. Just tell me what's gonna happen, okay? I get a little nervous with… stuff like this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little nervous. We'll start with your vitals – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and quickly feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take long, and I'll explain everything as I go. If you're comfortable, you can change into a gown, and we’ll get started. Do you need a moment?
PATIENT: Yeah, a moment would be good. Where's the… uh, changin' room? And how much do I gotta… take off? Sorry if that sounds dumb.
DOCTOR: Not at all, that's a perfectly reasonable question. It’s right over there. You can undress down to your underwear, and I'll give you a paper gown to wear. We're just doing a basic exam today, so we don't need a full strip. Take your time, and let me know when you're ready. I’ll be just outside.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks. I think I got it. I'll be out in a bit.
