DOCTOR: Hi Amy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I've been noticing a lump in my lower abdomen, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It's been there for a few weeks now, and it doesn't seem to be going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen for a few weeks... that's good you're getting it checked out. Hmm. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…well, it’s not really painful, just a bit…firm. Maybe the size of a plum, I’d say? It doesn't seem to change much in size, not that I've noticed anyway. It's located just below my belly button, a little to the left. I haven’t experienced any other symptoms, like fever or changes in my bowel habits or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right, plum-sized, firm, below the belly button and to the left… no pain, no other symptoms. Okay. And have you noticed any changes recently – any unintentional weight loss, changes in your appetite, or any feeling of being more tired than usual?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Now that you mention it… I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, but honestly, I chalked it up to being busy with work. I'm a choreographer, and we've been rehearsing quite a lot for an upcoming performance. As for weight loss or appetite changes… no, I don’t think so. My weight has been pretty stable, and my appetite is normal. Perhaps the tiredness is just the rehearsals.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness potentially related to work... that’s good to consider. Let's just rule things out, though. Do you have any history of similar lumps or bumps in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. This is the first time I’ve ever noticed anything like this. I’ve always been generally healthy, thankfully. My family doesn't have a strong history of… well, any major illnesses, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me about any allergies you have, or any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And I'm not currently taking any medications. Just vitamins occasionally, but nothing regularly. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful information.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications, just occasional vitamins…and you’re covered by Medicare. That is helpful. Alright, let’s do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll gently feel around to check the lump. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I will definitely let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. Please take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright… just breathing normally. Okay…I do feel a distinct lump about two inches to the left of your belly button. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, which is good. It feels… fairly firm, as you mentioned, and it doesn't seem to be movable. It’s about… maybe two centimeters in diameter. No rebound tenderness or guarding. It's not immediately concerning, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let me check your lymph nodes in the groin area just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. The lymph nodes…should I tell you if I feel anything unusual there too? Just like with the abdomen?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Absolutely. Any discomfort, any lumps you feel, anything at all that feels different, please let me know. Okay… your lymph nodes do feel slightly enlarged on the left side, but not dramatically so. It’s subtle. It could be a sign of inflammation or infection, or it could be nothing. We really need some imaging to get a better idea of what's going on. Now, do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I'm happy to answer whatever you need to know. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this properly. The enlarged lymph nodes... should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Amy. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. Enlarged lymph nodes can be caused by a lot of things, most of which are not serious. It's simply another piece of information we need to consider. Okay, so, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never had any need for surgery, thankfully. No broken bones or anything like that either. I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Is the imaging going to be a scan? Like a CT scan or something? I’ve heard those can involve…radiation.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about that. Yes, we’re most likely going to do a CT scan. It gives us the best view of what's going on in your abdomen. And you're right to be mindful of the radiation. We always weigh the benefits against the risks, and in this case, the potential information we’ll gain is really important. We’ll use the lowest possible dose to get a clear image. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think I would be. If it's the best way to get a clear understanding of what's going on, and you’re using the lowest dose possible, then I’m comfortable with that. It’s just… it's a little unsettling, you know? Having something like that done. What exactly are you hoping to see on the scan? Are you thinking it could be something serious? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I prefer to be informed.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay to ask questions, Amy. In fact, I encourage it. You're right to want to be informed. What we’re hoping to see on the scan is the size and shape of the lump, and whether it's affecting any other organs. It will also help us see if the enlarged lymph nodes are connected to the lump or if they’re a separate issue. Honestly, it could be a number of things – a cyst, a lipoma, or… less commonly, something more serious. But we don’t want to speculate until we have more information. We’ll be looking for any signs of malignancy, but again, that's just a precaution. I'm going to order the CT scan now. The clinic will call you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any known kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no kidney problems at all. I've never had any issues with them. I drink plenty of water, and I don't take any medications that would affect them, as we discussed. So the clinic will call to schedule the scan? About how long does it usually take to get the results? And will you be the one to explain them to me?
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. I've just sent the order to radiology. You should receive a call within a couple of business days to schedule the appointment. It usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to get the results back from the radiologist. And yes, I will be the one to explain them to you. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – any increase in pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. A follow-up appointment as soon as you have the results… that's good. And I will definitely call if I notice any changes. I appreciate your reassurance. I think that's all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease, at least a little bit. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and we'll be in touch soon.
