DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Um, well, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts sometimes. It's like a pain, in my… you know, where a woman’s… chest is. I am a man, but it still hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain can be concerning, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. You said it feels like pain in the area where a woman's chest would be – can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy feeling? Sometimes it's just sore. Like I did too much work. I do roofing, you know? Heavy lifting. But it's been happening even when I rest. It's hard to explain. It's not like… a muscle pain, exactly. It's… inside, more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling, sometimes sore, and it feels deeper than just a muscle pain… that’s helpful. And you’ve noticed it even when you’re resting, despite doing physically demanding work. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Not really. I don't think so. Sometimes maybe… when I wear a tight shirt? But I wear tight shirts all the time for work, so I don't know. And it’s not always after work. It just… happens. My wife, she says I should come see a doctor, and I guess she is right. I don't usually bother doctors.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your wife encouraging you to come in. It’s always good to listen to loved ones, and you're right, it's better to get things checked out. And don't worry, we'll figure out what's going on. Just to get a better picture, have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Um… no, not really. I don’t think so. No fever, no cough. Everything else feels normal. I eat okay, sleep okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s from the roofing. No… lumps or anything. My wife checked, she said everything looked normal, but she is not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or any lumps – that's good. You mentioned feeling a little tired, which we can attribute to the roofing work. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I haven’t really been to doctors. Like I said. I try to stay healthy. Eat good food, work hard. Never had any big sicknesses, I don’t think. Just… normal stuff. Colds sometimes. Nothing serious. My wife says I am stubborn. She is probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it sounds like you generally are healthy, which is great. No history of any diagnosed medical problems. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree, but that was it. Just a cast. That’s all. I'm pretty careful now, mostly. Roofing is dangerous, but I try to be safe. My wife worries a lot, so I have to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides the broken arm when you were a child – good. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has had heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… something with his heart. I don't really remember what. He died when I was young. And my mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it. My wife knows more about that stuff. She talks to my family more than I do. She said something about my grandfather having… problems with his sugar, but I don’t know. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A history of heart problems in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and potential sugar issues in your grandfather. We'll keep that in mind. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never liked it. I drink beer sometimes, on the weekend. Just a couple. Nothing much. And no, I don't do… those things. I work too hard to do that stuff. My wife would kill me if I did. She’s very healthy. I try to be like her.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, you don’t smoke, only drink a couple of beers on the weekend, and don’t use any recreational drugs. Excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't really like taking pills. Just when I have a bad headache, maybe. But that's it. I try to rest when I am sick. And drink water. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them. She gets mad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional headache pills and sometimes vitamins you forget to take. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had any bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I work outside all the time, so I get pollen, but I’m okay. Sometimes I get itchy, but that’s just from the sun. My wife puts lotion on me. She takes good care of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s great. Alright, Aron. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a general assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. My wife said I should get checked out, so I trust you. I just want to know what’s wrong, if anything. I have work to do, you know? But I will take the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… Alright, that’s 140/90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning on its own. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's faint, but it's there. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your chest… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Um… yes, a little. Right here. Not a sharp pain, just… sore. Like a bruise, maybe. But I haven't hit myself. It's been like this for a few weeks. And… yes, here too. A little bit. It hurts more when you push.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the center of your chest and on your side, especially with palpation. I'm also noting some slight muscle guarding in those areas. Your range of motion seems good, no limitations. I don’t see any visible rashes or deformities. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be musculoskeletal – meaning related to your muscles or bones – but the murmur and the tenderness warrant further investigation. Given your family history and the murmur, I want to order an EKG and a chest X-ray. These will help rule out any heart-related issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: An EKG and… a chest X-ray? I don’t know. Those sound expensive. I don't have insurance, Doctor. I just… I just want to know if it's something serious. Can't you just tell me that? I have bills to pay. My wife… she is worried about money. I don't want to worry her more.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Aron, and you're right to ask about the cost. I completely appreciate that not having insurance makes this much more stressful. The EKG and X-ray are important because the murmur I heard, combined with the tenderness in your chest, requires us to rule out anything serious, like a heart problem. Let me explain the costs upfront. An EKG typically costs around $150-250, and a chest X-ray around $100-300. I can also look into options for a lower-cost facility or payment plan, and we have a social worker who can help you explore financial assistance programs. However, ignoring these symptoms could be risky. We need to determine the cause of the murmur and the tenderness. Would you be open to discussing those options, or potentially starting with just the EKG to see what that reveals?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. An EKG sounds better. Just the EKG, for now. Let's see what that says. I don’t want to spend too much money. And… can you tell me what it is looking for? What does it mean if something is wrong? My wife… she likes to read things on the internet. I don’t want her to get scared. Maybe you can explain it to us both.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Aron. That’s a very sensible approach, and I’m happy to explain everything clearly. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us detect things like irregular heartbeats, signs of a heart attack, or evidence of previous heart damage. If the EKG is normal, that’s excellent news, and we can focus on the musculoskeletal aspect of your pain. If it does show something abnormal, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re having a heart attack or have a serious problem. It just means we need to investigate further, potentially with more advanced tests. I’ll explain the results to you and your wife in detail, and we’ll discuss all your options. I promise to be upfront and honest, and to answer all your questions. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let me get the order for the EKG entered, and we’ll get you scheduled. It should only take about 10-15 minutes. We have a technician available this afternoon. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. This afternoon is good. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have work tomorrow. And… thank you. For explaining things. And for not… you know, scaring me. My wife will be relieved. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. It’s my job to make sure you understand what’s going on and feel comfortable. I’ll get you scheduled for the EKG now, and the technician will come in to get you set up. While we wait for the technician, are there any other questions or concerns you have that I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… I hope it's nothing serious. I need to work. My wife… she needs me to work. Thank you again. For everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll get this figured out, Aron. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. I’ll be right here to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. Here’s the technician now. She’ll explain the procedure to you. It’s quick and painless. I’ll be nearby if you need anything. .
