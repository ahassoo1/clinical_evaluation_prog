DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, no offense, but “nice to meet you” feels a little… much, considering. I’m here ‘cause I’ve been, well, throwing up blood. Not a lot, but enough to make me think I shouldn’t ignore it. It started a couple days ago. And it’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Gentz. You're right to be concerned about throwing up blood, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked. That is something we need to investigate. “Not a lot” is still concerning, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. To start, can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It’s… red. Like blood usually is. Is this a trick question? Is there different kinds of red blood? Look, I’m not a doctor. It wasn’t bright red, more…darker. Like coffee grounds, maybe? And it smelled… metallic, if that makes any sense. Honestly, the whole thing just smells bad. Does that help?
DOCTOR: No, no trick question at all, Mr. Gentz. You're describing it perfectly, and yes, there are differences in the appearance of blood that can give us clues. “Darker, like coffee grounds” and “metallic smell” are very helpful details. Thank you. Was there anything that seemed to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Hmm. Not really. I ate a kebab the night before the first time, but I eat kebabs all the time! Never had this happen before. I was feeling a bit stressed with… some paperwork, but that's nothing new either. It just… started. Woke up and there it was. Honestly, I just thought it was a bad dream at first. A really, really gross dream.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it wasn’t related to anything specific you ate, and stress doesn’t seem to be a direct trigger. I understand it came on suddenly. And you mentioned paperwork… is this work-related stress, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s… complicated paperwork. Estate stuff. My wife… passed a few months back. Still sorting through everything. It’s just… endless forms, bills, lawyers. It’s a whole mess. It’s not like I'm crying over it or anything, but it's a constant weight, you know?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Gentz. That is a significant weight, and it’s completely understandable that it would be stressful. It’s good you’re acknowledging it. Let’s focus on the vomiting for now, but knowing that background helps me understand the whole picture. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I've been a bit tired, I guess. But who isn’t tired? My stomach's been a little… off. Not exactly pain, more like… queasy. And I've been going to the bathroom more, if you get my meaning. It’s not diarrhea or anything, just… frequent trips. And I've noticed I’m a little weaker than usual. I used to walk to the store, now I find myself taking the bus. Small things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, queasiness, increased urination, and some weakness… all helpful information. Has there been any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I mean, I'm not starving, but I haven’t been eating much. More out of not feeling up to it, I think, than anything else. Kebabs taste…less good than they used to. Which is saying something. I usually love kebabs. Honestly, everything just feels a bit… blah.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes, and it will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? I've got things to do. Important paperwork. I don’t particularly enjoy people poking around.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Now, I'm going to press gently on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your blood pressure is a little on the low side, 105/65. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but you do have some mild tenderness in your upper left quadrant. Do you usually feel pain there?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not usually. Just… a little uncomfortable when you pressed. Like a dull ache, maybe? It's not a sharp pain, nothing like that. Just… something's off. Like when you've eaten something bad and your stomach's a bit grumbly. Honestly, Doc, I’m not a doctor, you know? This is all just… vaguely unpleasant. Can we get to why I'm throwing up blood now? I don't understand what all this poking around is for.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Gentz. I apologize for the poking around. It’s just part of the process to try and rule things out. The tenderness is something I need to investigate. Based on what you've told me – the vomiting blood, the fatigue, the queasiness, the tenderness, and the recent loss – I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor like a stomach ulcer, gastritis, or even a severe acid reflux episode. However, given the blood in your vomit, we need to rule out more serious causes, such as internal bleeding or problems in your esophagus or stomach. To do that, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count to check for anemia and signs of infection, and a metabolic panel to look at your kidney and liver function. I also want to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood and rule out infection. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Of course. That’s always the answer, isn’t it? Fine. Do the tests. Whatever it takes to get this sorted. I haven’t got all day. Just… tell me where to go to get them done and how long it’ll take. I need to get back to my paperwork. And how much is all this going to cost? I don’t even have insurance, you know. This is going to be expensive, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I know it’s not ideal. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. They'll take a blood sample and collect a stool sample. It should take about 30-45 minutes, including wait time. Regarding the cost, I realize you mentioned not having insurance. Let me see what options are available… The blood work and stool test will cost approximately $250. We do have a payment plan available if that helps, or we can explore some local resources that may offer financial assistance. I can provide you with a list of those organizations. We can also discuss a possible discount. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help reduce the stomach acid, which might alleviate some of the nausea and discomfort. It’s called Omeprazole, and it’s a fairly common medication. It won't solve the problem, but it can provide some temporary relief. Would you like me to write you a prescription?
PATIENT: $250? Just for blood and… stool? That’s outrageous. Fine. Write the prescription. I suppose something to stop the nausea is better than nothing. And give me the list of those resources, alright? I don’t expect miracles, but it can’t hurt to look. Honestly, this whole thing is just… a mess. Just… how long will it be before we have the results? And what happens then? Will I need to come back for more poking around?
DOCTOR: Okay, here’s the prescription for Omeprazole. It’s a 20mg capsule, take one capsule daily, preferably 30 minutes before a meal. And here’s the list of resources. I’ve highlighted a couple that are specifically geared towards helping uninsured individuals with medical expenses. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll call you as soon as they're available. And regarding further testing, it depends on the results. If the blood work and stool test are normal, we may need to consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy – a procedure where they use a thin, flexible tube with a camera to look inside your esophagus and stomach. That's something we'll discuss after we get the initial results. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you vomit more blood, experience severe abdominal pain, or feel dizzy or weak – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… right. Just what I needed. Fine. I understand. 24-48 hours. I'll try not to think about it. Look, Doc, I appreciate you trying to help, alright? But honestly, this whole thing just feels… overwhelming. I've got enough on my plate as it is. Just… call me when you have something. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I understand completely. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
