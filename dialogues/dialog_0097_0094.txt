DOCTOR: Hi Airam, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Just… the paper said to come. For… learning? My husband, he filled the form. I don’t really remember why. It’s… about my health, I think? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Sometimes the paperwork can be a bit confusing. No worries at all. It sounds like your husband scheduled this appointment for a general health check-up. That’s a great idea. To get us started, and just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about why he thought it would be a good idea to come in?
PATIENT: Hmm. He… he worries too much. Always. I feel fine. I work, I cook, I clean. I don’t… sit around. He says I get tired easy. But everyone gets tired! It's hot, you know? And the work is… hard. Metal is heavy. He just… likes doctors. He goes all the time for nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good he’s thinking about your health, even if it feels a little…overzealous. And you're right, everyone gets tired, especially with a demanding job. You mentioned you work with metal – is that a physical job?
PATIENT: Yes! Very. Sheet metal. Cutting, bending, lifting… all day. My hands… they hurt sometimes. And my back. But it’s work. People need roofs, you know? I don't sit and complain.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that sounds incredibly demanding, and you're very dedicated. It's important to acknowledge when physical work takes a toll on the body. Okay, so we have the sheet metal work, lifting, bending, cutting... Do you notice any specific times of day when the pain is worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. End of the day, always. After work. And… when it rains. Cold makes it worse. My fingers get… stiff. Like old lady fingers.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the pain is worse at the end of the day, and the cold seems to aggravate it. And you mentioned stiffness, especially in your fingers. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a relatively new thing?
PATIENT: A long time. Years. I don’t… pay attention to these things. It’s just… work. You get used to it. My mother, she did the same work. Her hands were always like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this has been a long-term issue, and it’s something you’ve experienced throughout your working life, like your mother. That gives me a better understanding. Aside from the hand and back pain, are there any other symptoms you’ve been noticing?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? I don’t… know what that means. Like… being sick? No. I don't get sick. Maybe a little tired, like I said. And sometimes… my feet hurt. From standing all day. But everyone's feet hurt.
DOCTOR: “Symptoms” just means anything you’re feeling that’s different or bothersome. So, tiredness, pain in your feet, that's good to know. It sounds like a lot of aches and pains from the physical work. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? I… I don’t go to the doctor. Never have. Except for… when I had my baby. Years ago. That’s it. I don’t remember anything about it. Just… a baby. A healthy baby. My husband, he’ll know more. He keeps all the papers.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can work with that. It's good to know you had a healthy baby. Since you don’t have much medical history to share, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis… my mother had that. Bad. In her hands, mostly. She couldn’t… hold things anymore. That’s why she stopped working. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He always complained about his head. But he smoked too much. Everyone smoked back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That's helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam…? You mean… touch me?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. It’s a standard part of a check-up. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and gently examine your joints – just to see how they’re moving. It’s nothing to worry about, and I'll explain everything as I go. You can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain what I'll be doing step-by-step before we start?
PATIENT: Step-by-step… okay. Maybe. First… what do you do?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’ll use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs. It doesn't hurt at all, I just need to place it on your chest. It helps me check for any unusual sounds. Then, I'll take your blood pressure – that involves wrapping a cuff around your arm. You might feel a little squeeze. After that, I'll check your pulse and temperature. Finally, I'll gently examine your hands and feet, looking for any swelling or tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Swelling… my feet sometimes get a little swollen at the end of the day. But that’s… normal, right? From standing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very common with a job that requires a lot of standing. Swelling in the feet at the end of the day is often due to fluid buildup. I'll just want to take a look to make sure everything looks okay. Shall we start with listening to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick as possible. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Take nice, deep breaths for me, if you would. Alright. Everything sounds clear so far. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, let's check your blood pressure.
