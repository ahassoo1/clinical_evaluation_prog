DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It’s been… bothering me for a little while now. It’s mostly in my… well, I’ll try to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take your time. “A little while” is vague, though. Can you be more specific about how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little ache. But it’s gotten worse lately, that's for sure. Now it’s pretty constant, if I'm doing anything.
DOCTOR: Constant with activity, you say. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s in my lower back, mostly. But it kind of shoots down into my… well, down my leg, sometimes. Not always, but when it flares up, yeah, down the leg. The left one, I think. Or maybe both? It's a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Both legs, or just the left?
PATIENT: Mostly the left, I think. Yeah, definitely more on the left side. It doesn’t go all the way down to my foot, thankfully, just… the back of my thigh and my calf, sometimes. It’s just… uncomfortable. Makes it hard to walk for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, lower back pain radiating down the left leg, primarily to the thigh and calf. And this is exacerbated by walking. Now, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Exacerbated… that means it gets worse with walking, right? Yes, walking makes it worse. And the pain… it’s not really sharp, more like… a dull ache. But when it flares up, like you said, it can get pretty bad. Like a throbbing, maybe? And sometimes I get a little tingling, too. Down my leg. Not numbness, just… tingling.
DOCTOR: A dull ache with throbbing when it’s worse, and tingling in the leg. Is the tingling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It's not there all the time. Usually, it happens when I've been on my feet a lot. Or if I bend over to pick something up. Then I'll feel it for a little while after. It's not every time, but often enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sitting helps. Or lying down. Definitely lying down. And… sometimes a warm bath, that feels pretty good. But it doesn't last long, the relief, you know? Just for a little while. It's not a cure, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Right. Sitting, lying down, and warm baths provide temporary relief. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills, and it went down. I haven’t had any major problems, though. No surgeries or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: You were treated for high blood pressure – are you still taking medication for that?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. The doctor took me off of it a couple of years ago. Said my numbers were good. Just been getting regular check-ups since then. Everything was fine last time, I think. It was at the VA, you know, so it’s all in their system.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Past medical history is relatively unremarkable. Any family history of back problems, arthritis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had arthritis in her hands, I think. Pretty bad towards the end, she couldn’t really use them much. And my uncle… I think he had something with his back, but I don’t remember the details. He lived in the Philippines, so it was hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, hospitalizations, or serious injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I twisted my ankle playing basketball when I was young, but that healed up just fine. Never broken any bones or anything. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: And what about your current medications?
PATIENT: Just vitamins, Doctor. A multivitamin, and sometimes I take fish oil. That’s it. I try to eat healthy, but you know, it’s good to have a little extra, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken all sorts of medicines over the years for colds and flu, but never any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. Definitely nothing excessive. And no, no recreational drugs, never.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let me ask you about your activity level. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, so it's pretty relaxed. I used to be an Operations Research Analyst, mostly working with computers and numbers. Now I mostly spend time with my wife, gardening, and trying to keep busy. We walk a little bit, but not as much as we used to. The pain makes it hard, you know? I do a lot of sitting, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a relatively sedentary lifestyle. Now, before we proceed, Mr. Way, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'd like to examine your back – I'll have you lie down on the examination table. I’ll palpate your spine to check for tenderness and assess your range of motion. Afterwards, I’ll need you to perform a few simple movements to assess nerve function in your legs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if you want me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Let’s start with palpating your spine. There's some tenderness here, on the lower back. Now, I’d like you to bend forward and touch your toes, if you can. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Ouch… that’s a little uncomfortable. I can’t quite reach my toes, and it hurts a little bit when I bend over. It’s mostly in my lower back, like a pulling sensation. That’s about as far as I can go comfortably.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited forward flexion. Now, let’s try straightening your leg while lying on your back. I’m going to lift your left leg, keeping it straight. Let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. And do you feel any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! That’s the pain, Doctor. It shoots down my leg when you lift it up that high. Not a sharp pain, but… a tingling, and a sort of ache. It's the same pain I was telling you about. That definitely makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. We've got some reproduction of your pain with that maneuver. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in both legs. No obvious signs of swelling or anything like that.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. So, what does all that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I’m a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you likely have lumbar radiculopathy. This means there’s irritation or compression of a nerve root in your lower back. The tenderness over L4-L5, the limited range of motion, and the reproduction of pain with the straight leg raise test are all consistent with this diagnosis. Now, the cause of this can vary. It could be a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or degenerative changes in your spine. The fact that your strength and reflexes are intact is a good sign. However, the pain is clearly impacting your quality of life. To confirm this diagnosis and determine the exact cause, I recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will give us a detailed look at the structures in your back and identify any potential sources of nerve compression. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. That sounds… serious. Degenerative changes… is that just… getting old? And what does that even mean? And the herniated disc… is that something I did? I’ve never had any major injuries, like I said. Is it something I should have been doing differently? I’m a bit confused, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Way, “degenerative changes” simply means that, with age, the structures in your spine naturally wear down. It's a normal process, but it can lead to nerve irritation and pain. As for the herniated disc, it’s not necessarily something you did. Discs can herniate spontaneously, or as a result of minor, repetitive movements over time. It doesn't always require a specific injury. However, maintaining good posture, proper lifting techniques, and a healthy weight can help to prevent further injury. As for the MRI, it's a non-invasive imaging test. We'll send you to a radiology center, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on in your back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a course of conservative treatment. This includes over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to reduce inflammation. I'll also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with any muscle spasms. And I strongly advise you to limit activities that aggravate your pain, and to focus on gentle stretching and strengthening exercises. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, stretching… So, not surgery right away, that’s good. And the MRI will tell us for sure what’s going on. I think I understand. But… What if the MRI shows something bad? Like, something that does need surgery? What are my options then? And… what about the cost of all this? The MRI, the medication… I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, it’s highly unlikely that we’ll immediately jump to surgery based on an MRI result. Most cases of lumbar radiculopathy can be effectively managed with conservative treatment. However, if the MRI reveals significant nerve compression or instability, we may need to consider other options, such as physical therapy, injections, or, as a last resort, surgery. As for the cost, I understand your concern. An MRI can be quite expensive, and the cost of medication can add up. I will provide you with a written estimate for the MRI. We may be able to explore financial assistance programs or negotiate a lower rate with the radiology center. I can also prescribe generic medications to help reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. I will write you a prescription for Ibuprofen 800mg three times daily as needed, and Cyclobenzaprine 10mg at bedtime for muscle relaxation. I will also provide you with a referral to a physical therapist. I would like you to schedule an appointment with them as soon as possible. They can teach you proper exercises and techniques to help alleviate your pain and improve your function. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, physical therapy… and I’ll talk to the radiology center about costs. That sounds like a plan. I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Hopefully, it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Way. Follow these instructions carefully. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder problems, seek immediate medical attention. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in four weeks to assess your progress. And please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns.
