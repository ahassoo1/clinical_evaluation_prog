DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin'. Yeah, hi. It's... the nails, I think. They just look... funny. Not good funny, bad funny. I don't remember how they got like this, just that they are. It's been a bit, I guess. A while.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. “Funny” not good, I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a bit… can you try to recall roughly how long a bit is?
PATIENT: Ugh, time... it all runs together. Maybe... six months? Could be more, could be less. I don't really do dates, you know? Just noticed them lookin' weird one day. And they haven't gotten better. Definitely not better.
DOCTOR: Right, dates can be tricky. Six months is a good starting point. And they haven't been improving, alright. Are they causing you any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Nah, no pain. Just... look at 'em! They're all bumpy and... discolored. Like somethin' grew under there. It's gross, really. I try to paint 'em, hide it, but it don't help much.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me take a closer look. Yes, I see what you mean. They do have a somewhat unusual texture and discoloration. It could be a fungal infection, or something else entirely. Have you noticed any changes in the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm... lemme think. Not really. Maybe a little red sometimes, but I put lotion on. Always lotion. I dunno. My skin's always a bit sensitive. Everything bothers my skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitive skin is good to know. And you use lotion regularly, that’s helpful. Now, thinking broader... have you noticed anything similar on other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Other parts? Like... rashes? I get those sometimes. Little itchy bumps. Usually on my arms. But nothin' like this on my nails. Never on my nails. And they come and go, those rashes. This… this is stickin' around.
DOCTOR: Alright, rashes elsewhere, but nothing matching this on the nails. Good to know. Now, just to cover all the bases... do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? And my knees ache when it rains. But the doctor always just says it's old age. I'm forty, but I feel older, you know? I got Medicare, so they check me up now and then.
DOCTOR: Yes, forty can feel older sometimes! And Medicare check-ups are good. So, no specific diagnoses… just the tiredness and knee aches. Are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently?
PATIENT: Medications... let me think. No, nothin' regular. Sometimes I take somethin' for a headache, but that's it. And I had some antibiotics a few years back for a bad cough, but that's been ages. Definitely ages. I don't really like takin' pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just headache relief as needed and antibiotics a few years ago. Okay. Now, this is a bit of a personal question, but have you ever had any issues with nail fungus or skin infections in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, fungus. Sounds awful. No, I don't think so. My mother always warned me about walkin' barefoot in public places, said you pick up all sorts of things. I try to be careful. I haven't ever had nothin' like that, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful to know. Now, let's take a look at your hands a little closer. Hmm… yes, the texture is quite irregular. There’s some thickening under the nails, and a slight discoloration. It doesn’t look like a classic fungal infection, but it could be. To be sure, we really should get a sample to send off to the lab. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A sample? Like... cut a bit off? Ugh. That sounds... unpleasant. But if you think it's important... alright. Just don't make it hurt. I don't do well with pain. Is it gonna be a long process?
DOCTOR: It won't be much, just a small scraping from under the nail. And I promise to be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't be painful, just a little pressure. And as for how long... it depends on what the lab results show. If it is a fungus, treatment can take several months, but it’s usually very effective. If it’s something else, we’ll figure out a different plan. Let me get everything prepared. It'll only take a few minutes. First, I'll clean the area with an antiseptic. Then I'll gently scrape a small sample from under the nail. Finally, I'll put a bandage on it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Antiseptic... scraping... bandages. Sounds… clinical. But alright. Just be quick, okay? And don't poke too much. My nails are the only nice thing about me, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little pressure here… and there. It’s just a tiny scraping, barely noticeable. Almost done… just a few more… and there we go. All finished. All done. See?
PATIENT: Ugh. That was unpleasant. Not painful, exactly, but… weird. And now they're all bandaged up. They look a mess. How long 'til we get the results? And what if it's somethin' awful?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little uncomfortable after that. They do look a bit messy, but it’s only temporary. The lab usually gets the results back within a week or so. I'll call you as soon as I have them. And as for "something awful," let's not jump to conclusions. Most of the time, it's something treatable. If it is a fungus, we can start medication right away. If it's something else, we'll figure out a plan together. I promise we'll take good care of you. In the meantime, keep the bandages clean and dry, and try not to put too much pressure on your fingers. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Will I have to take pills? I really don't like pills. And can I still paint my nails? After, I mean. If I have to take pills, can I at least still paint my nails?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions! As for pills, it depends on what the lab results show. For a fungal infection, sometimes a topical medication – a cream or polish – is enough. If it’s more severe, we might need oral medication, but we'll explore all options first. And yes, absolutely you can still paint your nails! That's important for your spirits. If you do need medication, we might need to wait a little while until it starts working, but once it is, there's no reason you can't go back to painting them. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That's... good to hear about the nails. I guess I just worry. I don't like things bein' wrong with me. Well, I guess there's nothin' else for me to do but wait, huh? A week, you said? Alright. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, a week. And you're very welcome, Lacreasha. Waiting is never easy, but please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I'll give you a call as soon as the results are back. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
