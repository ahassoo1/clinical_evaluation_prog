DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get right to it. I’ve been…tired. Really tired. And it’s getting worse. Plus, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been…well, eating dirt. Not on purpose, you understand, but I just…crave it sometimes. It’s ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, getting worse…and a craving for dirt. Right. Okay. Let's try to unpack this a little. When you say tired, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly? Like… bone tired. Not just needing a nap tired. I could sleep for a week and still feel exhausted. It's hard to even get out of bed some days. And I don't have the energy to do anything I want to do. It's just… draining. Is that good enough detail for you? I really don’t see what this has to do with… the other thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. "Bone tired" is a good way to describe it. And you're right to ask about the connection. It could be related. Now, how long has this tiredness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, it started gradually, maybe six months ago? At first I just thought I was getting old, you know? But it's definitely gotten much worse in the last month or so. And that... habit... started around the same time, I suppose. Though I mostly tried to ignore it at first. It's not like I'm going around digging in the garden, if that's what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening, with the craving starting around the same time. Okay. And can you tell me a little more about this craving?
PATIENT: It’s just… a feeling. Like something’s missing. And then… I just want to taste the dirt. It sounds awful when I say it out loud, I know. It's not like it tastes good, exactly. It's just… satisfying, in a strange way. I usually find some in the garden when I’m weeding, and… well, I eat a little bit. A small handful. Don’t make a face, doctor. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thank you very much. I just don't understand why I'm doing this.
DOCTOR: I’m not making a face, Candis. It’s my job to understand what’s going on with you, and that includes things that seem… unusual. It’s good you’re being honest with me. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and this craving?
PATIENT: Ugh, other symptoms? Honestly, I'm 79 years old, doctor. What isn't aching? But… let me think. I’ve been a bit…forgetful lately, I suppose. Not terrible, but I misplace things more often. And my stomach hasn’t been right. A little…queasy, sometimes. Nothing I haven’t dealt with before. Honestly, I probably just need a good vitamin supplement. Is that what this is about? I hope it’s not anything serious. I haven’t got time for serious.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and stomach queasiness… okay. And it's been going on for about six months alongside the tiredness and craving?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. It all sort of… blended together, really. The tiredness started first, then the forgetfulness and the…unpleasantness with my stomach. And then, well, that started. I really don’t want to dwell on that part if we don’t have to. It’s embarrassing enough as it is admitting it to a doctor. Honestly, I’ve always been a very… private person.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. I won’t press you on anything you’re not comfortable with. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, treated with pills for years, but I stopped taking them a while back. Didn’t like the side effects. And arthritis, naturally. Everyone gets arthritis when they get old. Nothing else major, really. I've always been a pretty healthy person, all things considered. I eat a good diet, I try to stay active… well, used to stay active. Before I got so…tired. And I certainly wasn’t eating dirt before! It all feels very…wrong.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis…stopped medication due to side effects. Okay. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be thirty years ago now. And a hysterectomy, even longer ago than that. That’s about it, I think. Nothing recently. I’m a remarkably resilient woman, doctor. I don’t bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. Which is why I'm here now, I suppose. This tiredness is really interfering with my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and hysterectomy, both many years ago. Now, thinking about your family, are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family. Let me see… My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he was always sickly. A weak heart, I believe. And my sister… she had some kind of…nervous condition. Kept getting spells, you know? Always complaining. Honestly, I didn’t pay much attention. We weren’t a very close family. Is this really important, doctor? I'm starting to feel a bit… overwhelmed. I just want to know what's making me so tired.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Candis. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you taken any medications currently, besides the high blood pressure pills you stopped?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if I can. Pills just make me feel worse. I rely on a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet. Well, used to rely on a good night's sleep. Now I just feel… drained, no matter how much I rest. Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed in my body. It's starting to fail me. Is this… serious, doctor? You're making me nervous. I don't have time for a long illness.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. It's good you're being honest with me. Now, I’m going to ask about allergies, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to those things. I think I’m slightly allergic to cats, but I avoid them anyway. And maybe pollen, sometimes, in the spring. Makes me sneeze a little. Nothing major. Is that really relevant, doctor? I’m starting to feel like you’re asking about everything but the tiredness. I just want to know what's going on with my energy levels. It's really interfering with my life, you know? I have things to do. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Candis, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But make it quick, please. I haven't got all day. And please don't poke too much. I’m a delicate flower, you know. Do you have a clean stethoscope? Honestly, I’m very particular about hygiene. Just get it over with, doctor. I just want to know what's making me so tired.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candis. Everything is sterilized. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds…regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is…soft, but there's a bit of tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses that I can feel. Blood pressure is 110/70. Pulse is 68 and regular. A little low blood pressure, but nothing terribly concerning.
PATIENT: "Nothing terribly concerning"? That's what they all say, isn’t it? So, what does that mean, doctor? Am I going to be okay? I have a garden to tend, you know. I can’t be laid up in bed. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… anxious. This is all very unsettling. You haven't said anything about the… other thing. Is that relevant at all? Or am I just a crazy old woman eating dirt?
DOCTOR: Candis, you’re not a crazy old woman. And yes, the dirt eating is relevant. It could indicate a nutritional deficiency, specifically iron deficiency. It's called pica - a craving for non-food items. The tiredness, the faint heart sounds, and the lower abdominal tenderness could all be related to that. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood tests. A complete blood count to check your iron levels, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. We’ll also check for any vitamin deficiencies. In the meantime, I want you to try to avoid eating the dirt. I know that might be difficult, but it's important for us to get accurate test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, I hate needles. And avoid eating dirt? You make it sound so simple! It’s not like I'm deliberately seeking it out, you know. It’s just…a craving. But fine, I’ll try. But if I start feeling faint, I'm blaming you. And how long will these tests take? I haven’t got all day, doctor. Honestly, this is a whole lot of fuss over a bit of tiredness and a… peculiar habit. Is this going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. Just tell me what’s wrong with me already!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. The blood tests shouldn’t take long – just a few minutes. The results will take a couple of days to come back. As for the cost, I’ll have the billing department give you a breakdown of the charges, and we can discuss payment options. We can also look into assistance programs. I want to be clear – I don't have a definitive diagnosis yet. The blood tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. We need to rule out other conditions, such as anemia, hypothyroidism, or even certain types of cancer. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and eat a healthy diet, even if your appetite is low. And please, if you start feeling dizzy or weak, or if your tiredness gets worse, please call the office immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Fine. A plan, I suppose. But honestly, it all sounds very… serious. And I don’t like serious. Rest, fluids, healthy diet… I’ve been doing those things for 79 years, doctor! It hasn’t exactly been working, has it? But I'll get the blood tests. Just get it over with. And if it turns out to be something terrible, I’m blaming you for not figuring it out sooner. Honestly, this is a whole lot of fuss over a bit of tiredness and a… peculiar habit. Now, where do I go to get this blood drawn? And don't tell me it's across town. I don't drive anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, escort you there. She’ll take good care of you. And don’t worry, we’ll figure this out together. It's good you're being proactive. We'll get the results as quickly as possible and then discuss a plan. Sarah will be with you in just a moment. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
