DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure why it's happening, and frankly, I don’t have time to sit around figuring it out. Just want something for it, if you got anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re concerned about the shaking in your hand and would like to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible. We’ll certainly do our best. “A bit now” is a little vague – could you tell me roughly when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Months, maybe? Could be longer. It comes and goes. It's not like it’s constant, thankfully. Makes it hard to hold a glass, sometimes. And…well, it’s embarrassing, that’s what it is. A man shouldn’t be shaking. It looks weak, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want answers, especially when it’s affecting your daily life. And it's alright to feel embarrassed, but many things can cause a tremor, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. So, it comes and goes, and makes holding a glass difficult. Is it just your hand, or do you notice it in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Just the hand, mostly. Though sometimes, when I'm really tired, I feel a little…wobbly. But that could be anything, right? I'm eighty years old! Things are gonna wobble. It's not like it's a big deal, I just don’t want it getting worse. I used to have steady hands, you know? Good for directing.
DOCTOR: I understand. You used to have steady hands with directing, and you're concerned about it worsening. That's a valid concern. The wobbliness when tired is good to know. Now, does anything specifically seem to trigger the shaking in your hand?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like what? Stress, maybe? I used to be able to handle anything, but…well, things are different now. Lost my wife, you know? Don't know if that has something to do with it. Doctors always blaming everything on something.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Baide. Loss is incredibly difficult, and it absolutely can manifest in physical ways. It’s important to consider all possibilities. So, stress might be a factor. Besides stress, do you notice the shaking after any specific activities, or at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Activities? No, not really. It's just…random. Sometimes it’s worse in the morning, sometimes not. Honestly, I try not to think about it too much. It's annoying, that's all. Look, are you gonna poke and prod me? I don't like being poked and prodded. Just tell me what I need to take, and let's be done with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting to get this resolved quickly. I do need to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on before I can recommend anything. It won't be extensive, I promise. I'll just check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands and arms. It's important to rule out a few different possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Don't go poking around for too long. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Baide, I’m noting a slight resting tremor in your right hand, and your coordination seems a little off on that side as well. Your reflexes are a bit diminished overall, which is not uncommon at your age, but we'll want to keep that in mind. No significant rigidity that I can detect. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I'm not a doctor, you know. I get tired, I get aches, I'm eighty years old! Is this going to take all day? Look, I just want a pill or something. Something to stop the shaking. Don't need a whole life story, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. I'm not trying to make this a long process. I just want to be thorough. When I ask about other symptoms, I'm trying to rule out other possibilities. Okay, let’s try this. Have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles, any changes in your speech or swallowing, any difficulty walking or maintaining your balance, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision’s a bit blurry, always has been. And sometimes…sometimes my voice feels a little shaky, like it’s not as strong. But that's just getting old, right? Everyone’s voice gets shaky when they get old. I don't want to make a fuss over nothing. This is ridiculous. Just give me something for the hand.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and a slightly shaky voice. That's helpful to know. Given your age, a slight tremor, and the other symptoms you've mentioned, we need to consider a few possibilities. One of them is essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition, especially as people age. Another possibility could be Parkinson’s disease, although we'd need further testing to rule that in or out. I’m not saying you definitely have either of those, but it’s important to investigate. I'd like to order a blood test to rule out any other underlying causes for the tremor, and I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More tests? This is exactly what I was afraid of! Look, I don’t want to be poked and prodded and sent to a bunch of specialists. I just want the shaking to stop. Can’t you just give me something for it? Anything? A strong pill? I’ve got things to do, and I haven't got time for all this…this fuss. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution, Mr. Baide. It’s concerning that you’re feeling so agitated. I want to assure you I'm not trying to make this more complicated than it needs to be. However, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis could be harmful. There are medications that can help manage tremors, but it's essential to know the underlying cause first. I would not feel comfortable prescribing anything without a clearer understanding of what's going on. Given your reluctance to see a neurologist, and your concern about further testing, I can offer a trial of a low-dose beta-blocker, which is sometimes used to manage essential tremor. However, it’s important to understand that this is not a long-term solution without a diagnosis, and it may not be effective. We would need to monitor you closely for any side effects, and I would still strongly recommend a neurological evaluation. If you’re absolutely against seeing a neurologist, we can proceed with the beta-blocker trial, but I need you to understand the risks and limitations involved. Would you be willing to try that, with close monitoring?
