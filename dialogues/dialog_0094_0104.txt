DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a bit now. I just need something for it, please. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll do our best to get you sorted out quickly. A sore throat can be quite disruptive. To help me figure out the best course of action, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't do details. It just… hurts. Like when you have a cold, but maybe a little worse? I don't know. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. My husband always took care of these things. Is that enough information? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Ottaviani. And I respect that you're not one for a lot of details. “Like a cold, but maybe a little worse” is a good starting point. Just a few quick questions, if you don’t mind, to help me rule out anything serious. Have you noticed a fever, or chills?
PATIENT: A fever? Doctor, I haven't taken my temperature in… goodness, decades. No, I don’t think so. I get a little warm sometimes, but that's just… being me, I suppose. And chills... not really. Just this throat. It's very bothersome. Are you going to ask me a lot of questions? Because, frankly, I don't have the patience for a long examination.
DOCTOR: I'll keep it brief, Ms. Ottaviani. Just trying to get a clear picture. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or has your voice changed at all – become hoarse, perhaps?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… now that you mention it, yes, a little. It's not bad, but it's harder than usual to get food down. And my voice… maybe a little raspy? I haven't really paid attention. I talk a lot for my job, you see, and it's always a little rough by the end of the day. It’s probably just that. Look, is there something you can just give me for it? I don't need a whole song and dance.
DOCTOR: Okay. I hear you. Before I recommend anything, I do need to quickly examine your throat just to be sure. It'll only take a moment. I'll check your ears and listen to your lungs as well, just as a standard precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, must you? Honestly, Doctor. I work with machinery all day; I’m used to… things poking around. But truly, I don't feel like I’m sick sick. Just a sore throat. Very well. Get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just open your mouth wide and say “ah,” that would be great. Okay, everything sounds clear in your lungs, and your ears look good. Your throat is a little red, and I do see some white spots on your tonsils. It could be strep throat, but it's hard to say for certain just by looking. To be sure, we'd need to do a quick strep test. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Strep test? Is that… painful? I don’t like needles. And what if it is strep? Will I have to stay home from work? Because I can't afford to lose a day's pay. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very inconvenient. Just… can't you just give me something for the pain and send me on my way?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Ottaviani, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The strep test isn’t a shot; it involves a quick swab of the back of your throat. It might be a little uncomfortable for a moment, like a tickle, but it’s very fast. Knowing if it's strep is important because strep throat is treated with antibiotics. If it is strep and you don’t treat it, it can lead to more serious complications. If it's not strep, then it's likely a viral sore throat, and antibiotics wouldn't help. In that case, supportive care – rest, fluids, and pain relievers – would be the best course of action. Given your concerns about lost wages, we can discuss options for getting a quick diagnosis and potentially a short course of antibiotics if the test is positive. Would you like to proceed with the strep test?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I have things to do. And I expect a note for work if I do need to stay home. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, that’s done. Now we’ll need to wait a few minutes for the test results. While we’re waiting, can you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, particularly penicillin or other antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. My husband always handled the medication. He always asked those questions. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. If it makes me feel better, I'll take it. But I do not want anything that will make me sleepy. I have to operate heavy machinery. Very important machinery.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. We definitely want to avoid anything that would cause drowsiness. Okay, the test came back positive for strep throat. This means you have a bacterial infection that requires antibiotics. I'm going to prescribe you a course of Amoxicillin. It's a common antibiotic and generally well-tolerated. It shouldn’t cause significant drowsiness. It’s important to take the full course of medication, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to ensure the infection is completely cleared and prevent complications. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Complications? Doctor, what kind of complications? You're starting to worry me now. Is this serious? I have to get back to work, you know. Just... tell me what I need to do, and how long I’ll be out of commission. If at all. I really need to know. And I expect a written excuse for work, with specifics.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Ms. Ottaviani, and I apologize if I caused any alarm. While strep throat is usually not serious with treatment, if left untreated, it can lead to complications such as rheumatic fever, which can affect the heart, or kidney problems. That's why it's important to take the antibiotics as prescribed. With the Amoxicillin, you should start feeling better within 24-48 hours. Most people can return to work after 24 hours of taking the medication, provided they are feeling significantly improved. However, it’s important to listen to your body. If you still have a fever or feel very unwell, you should stay home. I’ll write you a note for work excusing you for 24 hours initially, with a note stating you may need additional time off if symptoms persist. I'll also include the diagnosis of strep throat. The prescription will be for a 10-day course of Amoxicillin. Take it as directed, even if you feel better before the course is finished. Drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions about the medication or the treatment plan?
PATIENT: Ten days? Honestly, that’s a long time. Are you sure it’s necessary? And what if it makes me sick from the medicine? Very well. I suppose I have no choice. Just… make sure everything is clear in the note. And I expect a detailed explanation of any possible side effects. I don’t want to be caught off guard. Now, can I go? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about side effects, Ms. Ottaviani. The most common side effects of Amoxicillin are mild, such as nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. If you experience any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing, rash, or swelling, stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention. I've documented the potential side effects in your note, and I’ll also provide you with a separate handout with more detailed information. Here’s your note for work, excusing you for 24 hours initially, with the diagnosis of strep throat and a statement that you may require additional time off if symptoms persist. The handout details the medication instructions and potential side effects. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. I’ve also made a note to check in with you in a few days to see how you're doing. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here already. Thank you… I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Ottaviani. Please take care of yourself and get some rest. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
