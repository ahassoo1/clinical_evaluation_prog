DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Sobkowicz, is it?
PATIENT: Yes. Sobkowicz. Henry Sobkowicz. Look, I don't have all day, you know. Busy man. What do you want?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have commitments. But a proper medical assessment requires some information. So, to begin… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Chest pain. And my heart… it feels like it’s going too fast sometimes. Like a bird flapping around in there. And the nurse, she said something about… pressure. High pressure. Not good. I take my pills, you know. But still. It happens.
DOCTOR: Chest pain and palpitations. And the nurse mentioned elevated blood pressure. You do take medication for this, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Little white pills. Every morning. Doctor… uh… Lee, I think. A good doctor. Used to come to the house. Now I have to come here. Much trouble. What do you need to know? Hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you describe the chest pain?
PATIENT: Describe? What do you mean, describe? It hurts! In my chest! Like… a squeezing. Sometimes it goes to my arm. Left arm. It's not a pleasant feeling, okay? Is that good enough describing for you? I don't have time for poetry.
DOCTOR: Right. Squeezing, radiating to the left arm. And how long does this pain typically last when it happens?
PATIENT: A few minutes. Maybe five. Sometimes less. Sometimes… a little longer. It comes and goes. Like a bad neighbor. You never know when he’ll make noise. Then it's gone. But it’s worrying, you understand? Especially with the heart thing.
DOCTOR: A few minutes, intermittent. And does anything bring on this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. Sometimes when I'm… you know… walking up the hill to the store. Or after I eat a big meal. My wife makes good food. Very good. Too much maybe. But good. It’s just… it happens. I don't cause it to happen. It just does.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned your heart feeling fast. Does this happen at the same time as the chest pain?
PATIENT: No! Not always. Sometimes the heart… flutters… when I'm just sitting. Watching TV. Nothing going on. Then the chest is fine. Sometimes it’s one thing, sometimes it’s the other. Very confusing! You should know these things, shouldn’t you? A doctor, I mean.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the exam table. Take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Ugh. This table is cold. Deep breath… like this? I don't like doctors poking and prodding. What are you listening for exactly? Is something wrong? You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: I’m assessing your heart rhythm and breath sounds. Heart rate is irregularly fast, approximately 98 beats per minute and somewhat faint. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but breathing appears slightly shallow. Blood pressure is 160/95. Your blood pressure is quite elevated, and the irregular heartbeat is concerning.
PATIENT: Elevated? I told you! The nurse said something. You doctors never listen. What does “irregular” mean? Is it bad? Just tell me straight, okay? I haven’t got all day to decipher doctor-speak. And what are you going to do about it? More pills? Because I already take pills!
DOCTOR: Irregular means your heart isn't beating in a consistent rhythm. It can be a sign of a serious underlying problem. We need to investigate further. I’m going to order an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. And a blood test to check for cardiac enzymes. These will help us determine the cause of your palpitations and chest pain. We also need to review your medication list to see if any adjustments are necessary. Do you have a list with you?
PATIENT: List? Oh, for goodness sake. My wife handles all that. She keeps it with her… in the kitchen, probably. I don’t memorize pills! She brings them to me when I need them. You’ll have to ask her. This is ridiculous. More trouble, more waiting. Just fix my heart, okay? That’s all I want. What about now? Can you do something now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot simply “fix” your heart without proper evaluation. Until we have the results of the ECG and blood tests, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of Metoprolol to help slow your heart rate and manage your blood pressure. It's a temporary measure. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist for further assessment. This is essential. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. My wife always asks. She's very careful. But… I had a rash once. A long time ago. When I ate… shrimp? Maybe. It was red and itchy. But that was years ago. And it could have been anything. Honestly, I don't pay attention to these things. Just… don't give me anything that will make me sleepy. I need to watch the news! It's important. And no shrimp. Definitely no shrimp. Now, can I go? This has been a very long morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Metoprolol 25mg once daily. Avoid shrimp. I’ll note the possible allergy. The nurse will review the medication instructions with you before you leave. You’ll receive a call to schedule the cardiologist appointment. Please ensure your wife provides a complete medication list at that time. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No! That’s enough. Just get me out of here. I have things to do. And tell the nurse to hurry. I don’t want to spend the whole afternoon waiting. I’m a busy man, you know. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: The nurse will assist you. Have a… day.
