DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Benites. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. It is nice to meet you. Well, I am here for… the talk on the telephone, yes? My daughter, she made the appointment for me. I don’t feel so good lately, but I don’t know exactly what is wrong. It is… everything feels a little slow, you understand?
DOCTOR: Slow… Yes, I see. A general feeling of being slowed down. That’s… not terribly specific, unfortunately. Can you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to say this… It is like… when I try to fix a car, I think slower. Usually, I know right away what the problem is. Now, I need to think… and think… and still, sometimes I don’t know. And also, I get tired faster. Even just walking to the shop… it takes more effort than before. It is… worrying me. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Mrs. Benites, it does. Cognitive slowness and fatigue… alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Maybe… six months, I think? It started small. I just thought I was getting old, you know? But it is not getting better. My daughter, she says I should come see the doctor. She worries a lot. She is a good girl. But six months, yes. Maybe a little more. It is hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Six months… alright. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe a little restless sometimes, but not too bad. My appetite is… normal. I eat like I always do. No trouble with that. And… oh! Sometimes, I forget things. Small things, you know? Like where I put my glasses. Or why I walked into a room. But nothing… big. Not yet, anyway. It frightens me a little to say this.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness… And would you describe these instances as more frequent recently?
PATIENT: Yes. Definitely more. Before, it was just… a normal old-lady thing, you understand? Now, it is… almost every day. This morning, I made coffee, and I could not remember why! I just stood there with the coffee pot, looking around like a… a lost sheep. My daughter, she is always telling me I need to write things down. But I never do. I should. Perhaps I should.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Benites, it's good that you’re here now. Now, let's go through some other things. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My blood pressure, it is a little high. The doctor, he gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. And… oh! My knees. They bother me a lot, especially when it is cold. The doctor said it is arthritis. He gave me some cream for that, too. But other than that… no. I think that is everything. I try to stay healthy. I really do.
DOCTOR: And what medications specifically are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It is a white pill… small. And… I think it has an “A” on it? My daughter, she fills the pills for me. I don't pay attention to the names. I just take them. I can ask her when I get home, if that is okay? I am not good with remembering those things. It makes my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Benites. That is... less than ideal, but we can work with that. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have taken many pills in my life, for different things. And never had a problem. I’m usually very lucky, I think. No allergies. At least, not that I remember. My daughter, she always asks me that question, too. And I always say no. She worries so much!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a sad question. My mother… she forgot things at the end. The doctors, they said it was her age, but… my daughter, she thinks it was something more. She was very confused. She didn’t remember us sometimes. It was… hard. And my uncle, on my father's side, he was the same. He needed someone to take care of him. He didn’t know who we were. It was very sad, Doctor. Very sad.
DOCTOR: I see. A history of cognitive decline in your family… alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, he passed away five years ago. It was a long time ago, but… I still miss him very much. We used to go dancing every Saturday. And gardening. I used to love gardening. Now… I don't have so much energy for that anymore. I live alone, in the house. My daughter, she comes to visit every week. She is very good to me. But… it is quiet. Very quiet. I don’t see many people. That is the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Benites. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief cognitive assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. I want to know what is wrong, you understand? I want to feel better. I’m a little nervous, but… I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My knees bother me when I move too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Benites. I will be as gentle as possible. Please just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… heart sounds are regular, but a little… faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation, though breath sounds are somewhat diminished. Reflexes are… slightly diminished. That’s not uncommon with age, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by sevens for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Counting backwards… that is… difficult. Let me think. One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… hmm… I am getting confused. It is… harder than it looks. Seventy-nine… sixty-two… oh, I lost it. I’m sorry, Doctor. I cannot do it. My head is swimming. It is… very difficult. I always had trouble with numbers. Even when I was young.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Benites. That’s alright. It’s just a quick assessment. Now, let's try something else. I'm going to name three objects, and I want you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me now?
PATIENT: Yes… apple… table… penny. I think I can remember those. They are simple things, you know? An apple, a table, and… a penny. I hope I can remember them later. I will try very hard. My daughter, she always tests my memory. She says it keeps my brain active. I do it for her, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your orientation to time and place. What is today’s date, Mrs. Benites?
PATIENT: Hmm… today is… August… the second? Yes, August the second. And the year… let me think. 2025, is it? Yes, 2025. I think so. My daughter, she told me. We have a calendar in the kitchen. I look at it sometimes. It helps me remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Benites. Based on what you've told me, and the brief examination, there are some concerning signs of cognitive decline. The fatigue, the difficulty with concentration and memory, and the diminished cognitive function… these things warrant further investigation. Now, I need to be frank with you. It could be many things, from medication side effects to early stages of dementia. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I strongly recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including brain imaging. Is that something you’d be willing to consider?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dementia… that sounds… frightening. Brain imaging… is that… painful? I… I don’t like the sound of that. But… if you think it is important, Doctor, then… yes. I will do whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is wrong. I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. She has her own life, you know? But… if this is what I need to do, then I will do it. Please… just tell me everything. I want to understand. And… what about the blood tests? Will those be painful?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be frightened, Mrs. Benites, and it’s good you’re being honest about your concerns. The blood tests are very routine – just a small sample taken from your arm. There might be a brief sting, but it’s very quick. As for the brain imaging, it's completely non-invasive. It’s like a very detailed X-ray, and you simply lie still while the machine takes pictures. No pain involved at all. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel to start. We also need to check your vitamin B12 levels – a deficiency can sometimes cause cognitive issues. I'll also write a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. Her office will schedule the imaging and a more comprehensive neurological assessment. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Vitamin… B12? I don’t know anything about that. And Dr. Reed… is she… good? I want a doctor who… understands. Who will listen to me. My daughter, she will help me with the scheduling. She is very organized. I… I suppose I should ask… how long will it take to get the results of the blood tests? And… what if… what if it is dementia? What happens then? I don't want to… lose my mind.
DOCTOR: Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient for nerve function, and a deficiency can sometimes cause cognitive symptoms. It's a simple blood test to check your levels, and if you are deficient, it can be easily treated with supplements or injections. Dr. Reed is an excellent neurologist, very compassionate and thorough. I’ve worked with her for many years and have complete confidence in her abilities. As for the blood tests, the results usually come back within a few days, typically three to five business days. And… if it is dementia, it's important to remember that there are many different types, and the progression varies significantly. There are also medications and therapies that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. It's not a quick fix, but it's a process we can navigate together. We'll also discuss support groups and resources to help you and your daughter. I want to be upfront with you – a diagnosis of dementia can be difficult to accept, but it’s not the end of the world. It's about managing expectations, finding ways to cope, and continuing to live your life as fully as possible. We’ll address this every step of the way. I'm going to write up the orders for the blood tests now, and the referral to Dr. Reed. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is everything. You have answered all my questions. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… being honest with me. And… for not laughing at me when I couldn't count backwards. My daughter, she always makes fun of me. Please… just tell Dr. Reed that I am very nervous. And… that I hope she is a kind doctor. I will let my daughter handle the scheduling. She is very good at that. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very… helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Benites. It's my job, and I'm glad I could provide some clarity. And I will certainly mention to Dr. Reed that you're feeling anxious – she’s very sensitive to her patients' concerns. Here are the lab orders and the referral slip. Please take these to the front desk, and they will schedule your blood work. Once you have an appointment with Dr. Reed, be sure to bring any medications you're currently taking with you. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointments, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. I wish you all the best, Mrs. Benites. And remember, you’re not alone in this.
PATIENT: .
