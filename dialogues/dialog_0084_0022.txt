DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat so much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn’t feel right. I forget what I ate yesterday, even! It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy feels big” and a decreased appetite…and some trouble remembering what you ate. That doesn’t sound silly at all. It's good you’re telling me about it. When did you first start noticing your tummy feeling bigger, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… roughly… hmm. It’s hard to say. A few weeks, maybe? Or was it longer? Everything feels… slow these days. I think… after the hot weather started, it got worse. But before that… I don't really remember. Sorry, dear. My mind… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. McConnon. It's very common for memory to change as we get older. A few weeks… okay. And has the feeling of being “big” been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly there… all the time. But sometimes… feels tighter, you know? Like… a balloon. And other times, it's just… full. Not painful, just… there. And makes me not want to eat. Even my tea… sometimes I forget to finish it. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly constant, sometimes tighter like a balloon, no pain. And that's contributing to your decreased appetite. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh dear. What does that mean? Like… going to the bathroom? Everything is harder to talk about these days. I… I don't really pay attention to those things anymore, if I’m being honest. Sorry. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be important, Ms. McConnon, and no need to apologize. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay, let's try a different approach. Have you been feeling any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No… no vomiting. And… nausea… is that when you feel like you want to… throw up? No, I haven’t felt that. Just… tired. Very, very tired. And a little weak, maybe. Like an old… rag doll. Is that a good way to say it?
DOCTOR: That's a good way to say it, Ms. McConnon. Tired and weak. Okay. And have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… weight loss… hmm. I haven’t been standing on the scale. I don’t think I’ve lost weight. My clothes still fit… I think. It’s hard to tell. I mostly wear the same things anyway. Is it bad if I have lost weight? I don't want to be too skinny.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll check your weight today. It’s a good idea to keep track. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… medical conditions… I don’t… I had something with my heart a long time ago, I think. But it was so long ago! The doctor… fixed it. I think. And my knees… they bother me, you know, when the weather is bad. But… that’s all I can remember. I've had a long life, Doctor. Lots of things have happened.
DOCTOR: Okay. Something with your heart a long time ago, and knee pain with the weather. Do you recall what was done for your heart, or who your cardiologist was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't remember the name of the doctor. It was… at the big hospital in the city, I think. A very long time ago. They… they gave me some medicine, and… something with wires? I think they put wires inside me. But it was a long time ago, dear. I was much younger then. It all feels like a dream now. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a procedure with wires at the hospital for your heart. That’s helpful. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Just… these. Vitamin D… the doctor told me to take it for my bones. And this… for my knees when they ache. That’s all. I don’t take anything else. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D and over-the-counter pain reliever for your knees. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies? No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I used to love flowers, but I don't go near them anymore. My hands get so shaky. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Unless… bees? I got stung once when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies except a bee sting a long time ago. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Listen to my heart… that’s good. And feel my tummy… yes. Do whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, dear. My skin is very thin these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. McConnon. I'm listening to your heart now. Sounds a little quiet, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear. And now I’m going to feel your abdomen. It is… soft. There's some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rigidity. It does feel… somewhat distended, Ms. McConnon. And I can feel a fullness in the lower abdomen. It’s tympanic, which suggests some gas. Overall, it doesn’t feel like anything acutely concerning, but we'll need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh… distended? Tympanic? Those are big words, dear. Does that mean… something is wrong? I just feel so full and tired. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need to go to the hospital? I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a breath, Ms. McConnon. "Distended" just means your abdomen feels a little bigger than usual. "Tympanic" means it sounds hollow when I tap on it, which can be from gas. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We just need to figure out why you're feeling this way. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any infection. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to get a better look at what’s going on inside. It will give us a clearer picture of your organs and help us understand the cause of your fullness and discomfort. Would you be able to come back to the clinic tomorrow morning for the blood work?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work and a… CT scan? That sounds… frightening. Will it hurt, Doctor? And will it take long? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And what if it finds something bad? I just want to feel better, dear. That’s all. I'm getting too old for all this fuss. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just some tea?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon. It is a lot, and I want to assure you we’ll take it one step at a time. The blood work is just a quick prick of the finger or arm – it’s usually over very quickly. And the CT scan is painless. You’ll lie on a table while a machine takes pictures. It doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. The reason I want to do these tests is to find out what’s causing your discomfort so we can get you feeling better. We won’t know what’s going on until we have more information. Before we proceed with the tests, let's discuss your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet… well, it's not much these days. I used to love to cook, but… I don’t have much appetite. I usually have a cup of tea and a little toast for breakfast. Maybe some yogurt. For lunch… sometimes a small sandwich, if I'm feeling up to it. And dinner… usually something simple. Soup, or a little bit of fish. I try to eat my vegetables, but… they don't taste the same anymore. I mostly just pick at my food. I don’t eat a lot of sweets, though. Never really liked them much. Just… simple food, Doctor. That’s all. And lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. Simple foods, lots of tea. And a decreased appetite overall. It sounds like you're not getting enough nutrients. Now, Ms. McConnon, given your age and decreased appetite, it's possible this fullness is related to constipation. Sometimes that can cause abdominal distention and discomfort. We could start with a gentle stool softener and see if that helps. Would you be open to trying that, while we schedule the blood work and consider the CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh… constipation? That’s… a private matter, dear. But… yes, I suppose I have been feeling a little… blocked up. A stool softener… that sounds… easier than all those other tests. If it helps, then yes, I’ll try it. But please, no more poking and prodding if we can avoid it. Is it a big pill? I have trouble swallowing sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s perfectly normal, Ms. McConnon. No need to be embarrassed. It happens. And yes, we’ll try the stool softener first. It's a small pill, and we can even get it in liquid form if that's easier. I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild stool softener. Take one with a full glass of water each night before bed. And let’s schedule that blood work for tomorrow morning, if possible. If the stool softener doesn't help within a few days, we can revisit the idea of the CT scan. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. A small pill and a little water. And if it doesn’t work, then we’ll think about the other test later. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I suppose I should be going now. It’s been a long morning. Will I need to bring anything to the clinic tomorrow for the blood work? Or just myself?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. Just bring yourself. You don't need to fast or anything special for the blood work. And if you have a list of any medications you take, even over-the-counter ones, it’s always helpful. Here’s the prescription for the stool softener. And here’s a card with the clinic’s phone number if you have any questions or concerns. Take it easy today, and let me know how you’re feeling tomorrow. I’ll see you then.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. I will. And thank you again for being so patient with an old lady. I appreciate it very much. Goodbye, Doctor Voytek. I hope you have a good day.
