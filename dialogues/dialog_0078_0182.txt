DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you too. Look, I haven't got all day, you know. I'm here for a clearance. For…the surgery. My daughter booked it. Says I need to get a check-up before they let me…improve things a bit. Honestly, a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. A pre-operative clearance is certainly important to ensure you're in the best possible health for your surgery. We want to make sure everything goes smoothly. To start, could you tell me a little more about the surgery you're scheduled for?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's…cosmetic. I'm having a bit of work done on my face. It's sagging, you see. A man needs to keep up appearances. Though, I fail to see what business of yours it is, really. It's not like I'm climbing mountains anymore. Just want to look…presentable. My granddaughter's wedding is coming up.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. That's perfectly understandable. It's completely valid to want to feel your best for such an important event. Presenting well is important, and we’re here to help facilitate that. And it is my business, in a way – to make sure you are medically cleared for any procedure, even cosmetic ones, to minimize risks. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you currently have?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Conditions? At my age, there are always something's. Let me think… my knees ache, obviously. Bad back now and then. And the doctor a few years back said my cholesterol was a little high, but I stopped eating so much rich food. Does that count? I'm otherwise perfectly fine. Never been a sickly man. I worked with stone my whole life – good, hard work. Keeps a man strong. Don’t need a list read out to me like I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Orwin. It’s good to hear you've been generally healthy and active. Knowing about the knees, back, and cholesterol is very helpful. We just want to be thorough. Regarding the cholesterol – do you recall if you were ever prescribed any medication for that, or if you were advised to make any specific dietary changes beyond reducing rich foods?
PATIENT: Medication? No, no medication. Doctors these days are too quick to prescribe pills for everything. I just cut back on the cream, the butter, the good cheeses. My wife used to make a fantastic brie… but, well. Anyway, no pills. Just sensible living. Honestly, I think they just wanted more of my money with those follow-up appointments. They always do. Are we almost done here? This chair isn't terribly comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Orwin, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. It’s good you made those lifestyle changes. We definitely don't want to over-medicate anyone unnecessarily. Just a couple more questions, then we can get through this quickly. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Hm. Let me think… a hernia, years ago. Must have been…forty years ago now? Something like that. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy. Aside from that? No. Nothing major. Stone work isn't exactly gentle on the body, but it doesn’t require knives. Are you writing all this down? It's all rather pointless, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am making notes, Mr. Orwin, so we have a complete picture of your medical history. Knowing about the hernia and appendectomy is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. Glucosamine, I think it's called. My daughter buys it for me. Says it helps. I'm not sure I notice much of a difference, but she insists. And… occasionally, an aspirin if my back is really bothering me. That’s it. Don’t take a whole lot of pills, I’ll tell you that much. Now, can we please wrap this up? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. Glucosamine and occasional aspirin – noted. One last section, if you don't mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. A strong Norwegian constitution, you see. We eat everything. Fish, meat, vegetables… everything. And I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine. Honestly, I think people make too much fuss over allergies these days. Now, are you finished? Because I really must go. I don’t want to be late for lunch. It’s with my granddaughter, and she gets terribly upset if I’m not on time.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Orwin. No known allergies. Alright, that completes the history portion. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I haven't got time for a whole physical. I told you, I have a lunch appointment. And honestly, I just came here for the clearance. I don’t need to be poked and prodded. My doctor back home never bothered with all this nonsense before surgery. Can't you just sign off on the form? I'm a busy man. Frankly, this is a waste of my time. Just tell me if I’m cleared or not. I need to know if I can go ahead with the surgery, that’s all. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, and I respect your time. However, to responsibly provide medical clearance, I need to perform a basic assessment. It’s not about bothering you; it’s about ensuring your safety during and after the procedure. I cannot sign off on the form without that. It will be a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. That’s it. Approximately five minutes. If you absolutely refuse, I will need to document that in your chart and I unfortunately won't be able to provide the clearance. This is for your own protection. Would you like me to explain the potential risks of proceeding without a proper assessment?
