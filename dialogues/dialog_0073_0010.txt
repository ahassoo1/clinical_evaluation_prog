DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s… somewhere on my body, but I’m having trouble pinpointing exactly where it started or when. It feels… recent, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Recent, you say. And you're experiencing some swelling... somewhere on your body. It's good you’re noticing these things, though a little vague makes it… challenging. Let’s try to narrow it down. Can you tell me where you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That’s… fair. It’s frustrating, I assure you. I… think it might be my face? Or perhaps my neck? It’s hard to say. It feels… puffy, I suppose. Not painful, just… different. I noticed it when I was shaving this morning, maybe? Though I could be mistaken. I often am.
DOCTOR: Right. Face or neck… puffy, not painful. And you noticed it this morning while shaving. Okay. Is the swelling on both sides of your face and neck, or just one side?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I believe it’s… mostly on my right side. Though it’s hard to be certain. It’s not drastically different, you see. Just… a little more rounded, perhaps. I don’t usually pay close attention to such details. Is that helpful, Doctor? I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: It's… something. Mostly on the right side, you say. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes. Let me see… No, not really. I haven’t felt unwell, no fever or chills. No difficulty breathing, thankfully. My appetite is normal, I believe. I did feel a little… tired yesterday, but I often do. It’s hard to say if that’s related, though. Is it common to feel tired when one is experiencing swelling? I truly am sorry for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No fever, no difficulty breathing, normal appetite. Tiredness is… nonspecific. We'll get there. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, or any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Vision… no, I don't think so. Everything looks the same as always, which is to say, a little blurry, but that's my glasses. I haven’t changed them in a while. And swallowing… no trouble at all. I had my usual breakfast this morning, no issues. I do sometimes choke on my coffee, but that’s a separate matter entirely, I believe. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision from needing new glasses, no trouble swallowing… alright. Let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I did have a bout of… something, a long time ago, when I was a child, but I don’t recall the details. My mother handled all the medical appointments then. I don’t believe I’m currently under the care of any specialists. No allergies, either, as far as I know. I apologize for the lack of useful information. It feels as though my memory is… fading.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I believe… yes. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. And… perhaps my appendix? It was a very long time ago, and my mother handled everything. I don't recall the specifics, unfortunately. It was… routine, I believe. No complications, as far as I know. Is that sufficient, Doctor? I really do wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and possible appendectomy… We’re getting somewhere. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… is quite large, and scattered. I haven’t been in close contact with many of them for quite some time. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, but I don’t recall the details. It was… a long time ago. I honestly couldn’t say with any certainty if there are any other conditions that run in the family. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I apologize. Is there a particular condition you’re looking for? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Right. High blood pressure in your mother, heart condition in grandfather… vague, as always. Let's move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. I find it rather unpleasant, actually. Alcohol… I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but very rarely. Perhaps once a month? And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I have never used any recreational drugs, and have no intention of ever doing so. I assure you, Doctor. I lead a very… quiet life. Is that helpful? I hope I'm not being too difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to confirm, you're currently not taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, none at all. Not currently. I don’t believe I’ve needed anything in quite some time. I occasionally take an antacid if I have heartburn, but that’s it. And very rarely, a pain reliever for a headache. But nothing regularly, nothing prescribed. Just… over-the-counter remedies when needed. Is that clear, Doctor? I’m trying my best to be thorough, despite my… shortcomings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look at this swelling then. If you could just sit up here for me. I'll need to examine your neck and face.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, do. I apologize in advance if I flinch. I’m not particularly fond of… examinations. But I understand it’s necessary. I’ll try to remain as still as possible. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I'm just feeling for any abnormalities. Hmm. There's some mild tenderness on the right side of your neck. And a slight… fullness. No visible asymmetry on the face, but the right side does seem a little… puffier than the left. Your lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. Okay. Now, open your mouth for me. Let me take a look at your throat.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, do. I hope it’s not too difficult to see. I haven’t noticed any pain in my throat, but I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. It's a little awkward, I must admit. But I understand it's for the best.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your throat appears… slightly inflamed. No visible signs of infection, but there is some redness. Tonsils look normal, though. Okay. That's enough for now. I’m going to order some blood work. It will give us a better idea of what's going on. We'll check your white blood cell count, thyroid function, and some inflammatory markers. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? No, I don’t believe I have any immediate questions, Doctor. Though… what exactly are “inflammatory markers”? And… is this something serious? I apologize for asking, but I’m naturally a little… anxious. It’s just… the uncertainty, you see. I understand it’s probably too early to say anything definitive, but any reassurance would be… greatly appreciated. And where will I get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: "Inflammatory markers" are just substances in the blood that indicate how much inflammation there is in your body. It's a broad term. As for whether it’s serious… it's too early to say definitively. The swelling could be due to a number of things – a minor infection, a reaction to something, or something else entirely. That’s why we're doing the blood work – to narrow down the possibilities. You can get the blood work done at the lab across the street. I’ll send the order electronically to them. They’ll need your insurance information. Once the results are back – which should be within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A minor infection… that’s… somewhat reassuring, I suppose. I’ll go to the lab across the street and provide my insurance information. A few days, you say? I will try to remain calm in the meantime. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and your… thoroughness. Is there anything I should avoid doing while we wait for the results? Anything that might exacerbate the condition? Or anything I should be looking out for? Perhaps a fever, or increased pain? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No fever, no increased pain. If you develop either of those, contact the clinic immediately. Avoid strenuous activity, and just… monitor the swelling. If it increases dramatically, or you develop difficulty breathing or swallowing, go to the emergency room. Other than that, just try not to worry. It’s likely nothing serious. I’ll also send a note to the lab to flag the results as “urgent.” Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does address my concerns, thank you. No strenuous activity, monitor the swelling, and seek immediate medical attention if I develop a fever, increased pain, or difficulty breathing. And the results are flagged as urgent. I will remember all of that. I truly appreciate your time and your… kindness. I’m starting to feel a little less anxious now, to be honest. I’ll head over to the lab immediately. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Any paperwork, perhaps? Or a specific request I need to make at the lab? I apologize for being so… meticulous. I just want to ensure everything goes smoothly.
DOCTOR: No, nothing else. I’ve already sent the order electronically to the lab. Just give them your insurance information and they'll take care of it. You don’t need to request anything specific. I’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Tomassoni.
