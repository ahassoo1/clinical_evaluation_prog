DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good while now. Not constantly, mind you, but they pop up at the oddest times. It’s a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: A nuisance, yes. Well, we’ll certainly try to get to the bottom of it. “A good while now” is rather vague, though. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, dear. I do ramble sometimes. Let me think… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? Around the time my grandson came to visit. He's a lively one, that boy! Lots of running around. I first noticed it after he left, actually. Just a little hiccup here and there, but it's been pretty consistent since then. Not every day, but most days, a few times at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks. And it began shortly after your grandson’s visit. Any particular triggers you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers. That's a good question. Not that I’ve really paid attention, to be honest. I thought maybe it was something I ate, but I’ve tried different things – eating slower, avoiding fizzy drinks… doesn’t seem to make a difference. Sometimes it happens when I’m relaxing in my chair, sometimes when I'm doing the dishes… really no rhyme or reason, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Right. No obvious dietary or positional link. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. No… not really. I haven’t felt sick or anything. No heartburn, no trouble breathing… just the hiccups. They don’t hurt, exactly, just… startling. And a bit embarrassing when I’m out with friends! You know how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. Embarrassing is certainly a good way to put it. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe… forty years now? And I've got a bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing too bad, just gets stiff sometimes. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think! I used to work as a psychiatric aide, you know, kept pretty busy on my feet back then. Nothing major, though. No heart trouble, no diabetes…
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal forty years ago and arthritis in the knees. No major medical problems otherwise. Any family history of anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tricky one. My mother lived to be 95, very strong woman, but I don't really remember her having any serious illnesses. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother, he had… something with his stomach, years ago. Needed a bit of surgery. But beyond that, not much that I recall. It wasn’t something we talked about much in those days, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. High blood pressure in your father, stomach issues in your brother. And you said you've had the gallbladder removed. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual for the arthritis, dear. A little bit of ibuprofen when my knees are acting up. And sometimes a paracetamol for a headache, but not regularly. Nothing else, I promise. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and paracetamol for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've had a few mosquito bites over the years, of course, living here in Fiji, but nothing serious. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. It will just be a brief check-up to rule out anything obvious. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding!
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No tenderness to palpation. I'm not detecting any masses or organomegaly. It doesn’t seem to be anything immediately concerning. However, hiccups lasting three weeks are unusual. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no smoking, never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing heavy, just a little bit to relax. I’m not much of a drinker, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, occasional small glass of wine. Given the duration and lack of any obvious cause on examination, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I want to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. It's just a precaution, Ms. Sucich. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, dear. If it will put my mind at ease, absolutely. Blood tests are no trouble at all. Just let me know when and where to go, and I'll be there. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this properly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a referral to the lab here at the clinic. They're open until 5 pm today. It will be a standard blood draw. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the hiccups become more frequent, severe, or are accompanied by any other symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds very thorough, dear. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just the emergency room if things get worse, right? And they'll call when the results are back. That’s good. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Duplichan. I feel a lot better just having talked it through with you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the lab referral. Have a good day, and I hope the hiccups subside soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, dear. You too! And I will. .
