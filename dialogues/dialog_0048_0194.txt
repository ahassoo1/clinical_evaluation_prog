DOCTOR: Right. Terasa Mayhugh, 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. It’s hard to explain. Like, sometimes I just… can’t hear. And I get really dizzy. It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. It just… comes and goes. And my husband… well, he used to get it too, you see.
DOCTOR: Dizzy and hearing issues… right. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It feels like… a long time now. Years, I think? It's hard to put a date on it, honestly. It wasn't constant at first, just little spells here and there. But it's been worse lately, that’s why I finally came in. My daughter kept telling me I should.
DOCTOR: Years… okay. And has anything specific triggered these spells, that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Not really, not that I can recall. Sometimes it feels like it happens when I’m tired, maybe? Or stressed. But honestly, I could be doing nothing at all and wham – everything spins. It’s just… random, I suppose. My husband used to say it was the pressure, but… well, he's gone now.
DOCTOR: Pressure… right. And are you experiencing any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. It’s not painful, exactly. It’s more like… a fullness? Like something’s blocked. And sometimes a ringing… a high-pitched ringing. It’s not constant, thankfully. But yes, fullness and ringing, and then the spinning, and then I can’t hear. It’s all a bit much sometimes.
DOCTOR: Fullness, ringing… okay. Have you noticed any drainage from your ears?
PATIENT: Drainage… no, no drainage. Nothing like that. Just the… fuzziness, and the spinning. And the not being able to hear. I keep having to ask people to repeat themselves, which is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, um… just what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I think it's… Lisinopril? Something like that. And that’s it, really. Just the blood pressure pill, and sometimes a little something for my arthritis, but not regularly.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… and something for arthritis, occasionally. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, just a runny nose and itchy eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look. Hmm… Both tympanic membranes appear normal. No signs of infection. Balance seems… acceptable. Though a little unsteady, but that could be age. Okay. It’s difficult to say definitively without some further testing.
PATIENT: Further testing? Oh dear. What kind of testing? I don't like tests. Is it something… serious? I just want my ears to stop doing this, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be serious, but we need to rule things out. I’m thinking an audiogram – a hearing test – and possibly a balance test. It will help determine the cause of your dizziness and hearing loss. It's standard procedure. We can get a referral to the audiology department; they're very good. It's just to be thorough.
PATIENT: An audiogram… and a balance test. Oh. Well, if you think it's necessary. My daughter will be pleased I’m finally getting it checked out properly. She’s always telling me to go to the doctor. Referral, you say? Is it far? I don't drive anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s located within the same building, on the third floor. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. They have transport options available if needed. Here. And if the dizziness becomes severe or you experience any other symptoms – headache, vision changes – go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, good. In the same building, that’s good. And transport… yes, that would be helpful. Severe dizziness… and headache, and vision changes. Alright, I’ll remember that. Thank you, doctor. I think that’s all I can remember for now.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you have any questions, call the clinic. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Alright, thank you again. I will. Goodbye. .
