DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Roseburrogh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. Oh, the cough. Yes. It's been… a while now. A dry cough. Just… keeps coming back. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been going on for a while. A dry cough, you said. And you're having trouble pinpointing when it began… that's alright, we can work through it. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It doesn’t hurt, not really. Just… irritating. Like something’s tickling my throat. And it happens… more when I… well, I don’t really do much these days. Maybe when I’m sitting for too long? I’m not sure. I used to work on cars, a long time ago. Maybe something from that? I don’t know if that matters. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of an irritating tickle than a painful cough, and it seems to be worse when you're sitting for a while. And you used to work on cars… that's good information, we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Do you notice anything else that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… let me think. Dust, maybe? If there’s a lot of dust around. My daughter, she sometimes cleans and… well, dust gets everywhere, doesn’t it? And sometimes, when it’s cold. A cold draft. That makes it worse too, I think. But… everything makes it a little worse, honestly. It’s just… always there.
DOCTOR: Alright, dust and cold drafts seem to be triggers, and it’s generally just… persistent. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. I get… tired. A lot. But I’m ninety years old, so… is that a symptom? I don’t know. Sometimes I feel a little… short of breath, maybe? But that could be the stairs. There are a lot of stairs in my house. It's hard to say. I don't really feel sick, just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some shortness of breath, especially with stairs. We'll definitely take that into consideration. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s a hard one. My daughter, she takes me to all the doctors… I used to remember, but now… I think… high blood pressure, maybe? A long time ago. And… something with my heart? I don’t remember the name. She’ll know. She keeps all the papers. I’m not very good with remembering things like that. I don’t think it’s anything serious, though. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and something with your heart, managed a long time ago. We can certainly look into the records your daughter keeps. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I think… when I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. And… oh, and my knee. I had my knee replaced, maybe ten years ago? It doesn’t bother me much anymore. But… that’s all I can really remember. I’ve had a lot of aches and pains over the years, but I don’t know if those were surgeries or just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a knee replacement about ten years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, dear. That’s another hard one. My daughter fills those little pill boxes for me, you know? Every week. I think… a little white pill for my blood pressure? And… maybe a something for my cholesterol? I don't really pay attention. She tells me what to take, and I just… take them. I don't know the names. It's easier that way. I'm afraid I'm not much help with that.
DOCTOR: Alright, you take a white pill for blood pressure and something for cholesterol, managed by your daughter. That's helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I used to be stung by a bee once, when I was a little boy, but that was a long time ago. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I eat just about anything my daughter cooks for me. She makes a good soup, you know. But… I can't remember ever having a reaction to anything. I don't think I have any allergies. But… if I do, I don’t know what they are. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your lungs and heart, and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My lungs… they don’t feel so good sometimes, but… I don’t know what they should feel like, you know? Go ahead. I’ll just sit here.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Pavlovic. Not anything terribly alarming, but it explains some of the shortness of breath you’ve been experiencing. Now I'm listening to your heart. It's a little bit… irregular. A bit of an uneven rhythm, but again, not immediately concerning given your age and history. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 85. And your pulse is irregular, around 80, but a little weak. Your throat looks clear, your ears are fine, and your abdomen sounds normal. Okay, everything seems… stable. We have some findings to address, but nothing that requires immediate emergency attention.
PATIENT: Stable… that's good. I like stable. Wheezing and irregular… those sound… serious, though, don’t they? But you said not emergency… I don’t want to be a bother. My daughter, she worries so much. What does it mean, though? What should we do about the wheezing and the… irregular heart thing? Is it the old blood pressure coming back?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking those questions, Mr. Pavlovic. It's not necessarily serious right now, but it does need to be investigated and managed. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of your airways, which could be due to a few things – like asthma, or even just age-related changes in your lungs. The irregular heartbeat is called atrial fibrillation, and it's common in people your age, especially with a history of high blood pressure. It doesn’t always cause problems, but it can increase your risk of stroke, so we need to monitor it. It could be related to your blood pressure, yes. It’s also important to consider if there might be an infection, or something else going on. I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. An EKG to look closely at your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to see what's going on in your lungs, and some blood work to check for infection and other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. My daughter will be happy I'm finally getting things checked out, I suppose. But I don’t like being poked and prodded. EKG… is that the one with the sticky things? And a chest X-ray… is that safe? I don't want too much radiation. Blood work… that's just a little pinch, I guess. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes. Do what you think is best. But… could we do it quickly? I get tired easily. And… are the results going to be bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, the EKG involves some sticky patches on your chest – it's painless, just a little uncomfortable. And you're right to ask about the X-ray. The amount of radiation is very small, and the benefits of getting a clear picture of your lungs far outweigh the risks. We use the lowest dose possible. And I understand your concern about the results. It’s impossible to say for sure what they’ll show, but we’re going to gather information so we can make the best plan for you. We're not necessarily looking for "bad" results, just answers. I’ll write you a referral for those tests, and the lab is very close to the clinic. It shouldn’t take too long. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results, and then we can decide on the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A week… yes, that sounds alright. Not too long. Close to the clinic… good. My daughter can take me. She’s good at remembering appointments. So… no more tests until then? Just the EKG and the X-ray and the blood work? And then we’ll see? And… will I need medication? I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood work for now. We’ll see what those tell us before we consider any further tests. And you're right to ask about medication. We won't start any medication until we know what's going on. It’s possible you might need something for your blood pressure, or something to help with your breathing, but we’ll discuss all the options carefully before making any decisions. We want to find the simplest solution that works best for you. Here’s the referral. The lab will need your insurance information, but your daughter can help with that. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Insurance… yes, my daughter has that. She always handles everything. I think… no. No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man who can’t remember anything. I suppose I’ll go home and rest now. And let my daughter make the appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s my pleasure. Don’t worry about remembering things – that’s what your daughter is for! And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Get some rest, and we’ll see you in a week. Have a good day, and take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye. .
