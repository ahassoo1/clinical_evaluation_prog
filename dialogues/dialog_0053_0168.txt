DOCTOR: Right. Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit delicate, really. I’m starting to date someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up. One doesn't want any… surprises cropping up mid-courting, does one? It’s simply a matter of ensuring everything is as it should be, you understand.
DOCTOR: "Mid-courting," is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I find the term… fitting. It’s not simply “dating,” you see. There’s a certain level of… seriousness involved. He’s a gentleman, very well-read, and I wouldn’t want anything to… distract from the potential of a lasting connection. Are you familiar with the concept of proper vetting, Doctor? It's terribly important, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Pandolfi, while I appreciate… thoroughness, we’re here for a medical examination, not a background check. But, I understand wanting to be… prepared. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current medical problems – anything at all that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Well, let me see. My knees do ache a bit in damp weather – inherited, I suspect. And I do get rather… winded climbing stairs, though that might just be a lack of regular exercise, honestly. But nothing serious, Doctor. Nothing that would be… alarming, I assure you. I do have Medicare, of course, so I try to stay on top of things. Do you need a list of medications? I don't take many. Mostly just a vitamin D supplement.
DOCTOR: "Inherited" aches and "might just be" windedness... very specific, Ms. Pandolfi. Let’s try a more systematic approach. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No, Doctor, nothing officially diagnosed. My general practitioner always said I was… robust. A bit overweight, perhaps, but otherwise quite healthy. He's retired now, Doctor Thompson, lovely man. He always said I had a strong constitution. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, it’s been a while, I admit. But I feel fine, Doctor. Truly. Is this necessary? All these questions seem… excessive, given the circumstances. I simply wanted to ensure everything was in working order, not undergo a full physical examination.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, you came to me for a check-up. A proper one. And given your…lifestyle changes, as you put it, a thorough assessment is essential. I need a complete medical history to ensure your wellbeing. Let’s start with your past surgical history. Have you ever had any operations or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… there was the tonsillectomy, of course, when I was a child. Dreadful experience, it was. And I had my wisdom teeth removed. Quite traumatic, actually. Other than that… no. No major surgeries. Nothing that would be of any…consequence, I assure you. Are you implying something, Doctor? This is becoming quite… unsettling. I came here for peace of mind, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Right. Tonsillectomy and wisdom teeth removal. Noted. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… A bit grim, actually. My mother, bless her soul, had… high blood pressure, I believe. And her sister, Aunt Mildred, suffered terribly from… arthritis, very crippling, it was. And my grandfather… he had a touch of diabetes, I think. It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. They weren’t terribly forthcoming about their ailments. Considered it… vulgar, to discuss such things. Are you writing all this down, Doctor? It feels…rather morbid, doesn’t it? Focusing on illness when I'm seeking reassurance.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, family history is crucial. Vague recollections of “a touch of” or “suffered terribly from” aren’t particularly helpful. Do you know if anyone in your family had heart disease, stroke, cancer, or any other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… now that you mention it, my Uncle Cecil… he had a heart attack. Quite sudden, it was. And my cousin Beatrice… she had breast cancer. A dreadful tragedy, really. She was far too young. But other than that… no. Nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, it feels as though you're deliberately seeking out the worst possible news. This is becoming quite distressing. Are you certain this level of detail is necessary? Perhaps a simple blood pressure check would suffice? I’m simply trying to ensure I'm…presentably healthy for my new acquaintance, not preparing for a terminal diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I assure you, I am acting in your best interests. You've presented me with a significant lifestyle change and a family history that warrants a thorough evaluation. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! I find the habit utterly repulsive. My mother always said it was terribly bad for the complexion, and I’ve always taken pride in my appearance. Alcohol, perhaps, on occasion. A glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps, or a small glass of wine at a social gathering. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I’m a lady, Doctor. Do you suspect I'm leading a… dissolute lifestyle? This is quite insulting, honestly. I simply want to be certain I’m in good health, not subjected to a character assessment.
DOCTOR: "A lady," you say. Very well. Now, allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think… I do get a bit of a rash with certain fabrics, mostly synthetics. And dust, terribly bothersome. But medications… no, I don't believe so. Though I did have a reaction to penicillin as a child, a mild rash, nothing serious. I do avoid it now, naturally. Honestly, Doctor, this feels… intrusive. Are you a detective as well as a physician? I came here seeking medical advice, not a comprehensive biography. I simply wanted a reassurance that I’m not harboring any hidden ailments. This is becoming quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. Fabric allergies, dust, and a childhood reaction to penicillin. Noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just the vitamin D, as I mentioned earlier. And occasionally, a mild pain reliever for my knees, ibuprofen, if they’re particularly troublesome. Nothing regular, honestly. Perhaps a few times a month, if that. And sometimes, a little something for my digestion. A bit of Pepto-Bismol, if I’ve eaten something…rich. Honestly, Doctor, are you compiling a list for the local pharmacy? This feels utterly ridiculous. I simply wanted a quick check-up, not a detailed inventory of my medicine cabinet. Are you sure this is necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, a “quick check-up” is rarely sufficient. Given your… thorough recounting of aches, pains, and family history, and now this intermittent use of ibuprofen, I think a physical examination is absolutely necessary. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Will you allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I hadn't anticipated… physical contact. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, be gentle. And do try to be discreet. One doesn’t want to…undisturb one’s composure, you understand. I do have a rather sensitive complexion. And I’d prefer you didn’t linger. I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon. This is all becoming rather…uncomfortable. But alright, proceed. Just…be quick, Doctor. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I'll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Oh. Is something… amiss? You’re frowning, Doctor. Is my heart… irregular? Honestly, I do get rather anxious in medical settings. Perhaps that’s elevating my blood pressure. Do try not to worry me, Doctor. I simply wanted reassurance, not a cause for alarm. Is it serious? Do you need to… call someone? This is becoming quite distressing. I'm feeling rather faint.
DOCTOR: It's not immediately alarming, Ms. Pandolfi. Your heart rhythm is a little uneven, but it could be due to anxiety, as you said. However, given your blood pressure and family history, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG to assess your heart rhythm more thoroughly, and some blood work to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Also, a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Oh. Tests? A chest X-ray? Heavens. That sounds…rather involved. And the blood work… needles, aren't there? Honestly, Doctor, this is all becoming terribly complicated. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just… monitor my blood pressure for a week or two and see what happens? I really don’t want to undergo a battery of tests if it can be avoided. It’s all so… disruptive. And I have a rather important social calendar. Perhaps a second opinion? Is that an option?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your reluctance, but I am acting in your best medical interest. Your concerns are valid, but dismissing these findings without further investigation would be irresponsible. I am not suggesting you are gravely ill, but these tests will provide valuable information and allow me to create an appropriate treatment plan if necessary. A second opinion is always an option, but it will only delay the process. I can arrange the tests here at the clinic. It will take about an hour, and I’ll explain the results to you personally. Will you allow me to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… an hour, you say? And you’ll explain the results personally? That does…reassure me somewhat. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary for my…peace of mind. But please, be gentle. And do try to be quick. I really must be going by lunchtime. Alright, Doctor. Proceed. But I insist on a full explanation of everything. And I expect a comfortable waiting room. This is all rather…trying.
DOCTOR: Very well. The technician is ready for you. I'll be with you as soon as I have the necessary forms prepared. Just follow the hallway to the left. .
