DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. I'm Dr. Galena. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this sensitivity to light, really. It's been bothering me for a bit now. Makes everything quite uncomfortable, especially when I'm outside.
DOCTOR: Hmm, sensitivity to light… alright. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I'd say, maybe three months ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little squinting. But it's definitely gotten worse over the last month or so. It’s starting to affect things, you know? Like, I have to wear sunglasses even on cloudy days.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, gradually worsening… And is it just bright light that bothers you, or are other things triggering it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It's mostly bright light, yeah. Sunlight is the worst, definitely. But even things like really bright fluorescent lights inside, like at the grocery store… those bother my eyes too. It’s not everything, but bright stuff, for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you describe it as pain, or more of a discomfort?
PATIENT: It's not really pain, Doctor. More like… a really strong discomfort. Like my eyes are straining, and everything feels too bright, almost washed out. And it gives me a bit of a headache sometimes, if I don’t get out of the light quickly enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort and headaches… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I haven't really noticed anything major. Maybe a little bit of blurry vision sometimes, but I figured that was just from staring at screens all day at work. I’m a dental assistant, so I'm looking at things up close a lot. But I can't say for sure if it’s connected, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, blurry vision could be related, could be something else. And have you had any changes in your vision generally?
PATIENT: That's a good point. I think… maybe my vision has gotten a little bit worse overall? I haven’t had my eyes checked in a while, to be honest. Probably five years, at least. I just figured I needed new glasses, but then the light sensitivity started and… well, that worried me a bit more.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years since your last eye exam. We'll definitely want to look into that. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any double vision, floaters, or a loss of peripheral vision?
PATIENT: No double vision, thankfully. And I don't think I've seen any floaters, like little spots or webs in my vision. My peripheral vision feels okay, I haven’t noticed anything missing on the sides. It's really just the light bothering me and, like I said, maybe a little bit of general blurriness. I don't want to worry you unnecessarily, Doctor. It's probably nothing serious, right?
DOCTOR: No, no, you're not worrying me at all, Arbin. It’s good you’re telling me everything. It's always best to be thorough. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy, to be honest. I did have the flu a couple of times, but nothing major. Oh… and I lost my wife, God rest her soul, two years ago. That was… difficult, but physically I’ve been okay. No long-term illnesses or anything like that. I take a daily multivitamin, that’s about it. Do you need to know about allergies? I don't have any known drug or food allergies.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Arbin. That must have been incredibly difficult. Alright, no major medical conditions, no allergies… and just a daily multivitamin. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had any reason to. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but it healed up just fine with a cast. Nothing more than that. I'm not a big fan of hospitals, if that makes any difference!
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family with a history of eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had cataracts when she got older, and she needed surgery for them. And my grandfather, on my father's side, he wore glasses all his life, but I don’t know if it was anything specific. I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history, to be honest. We weren’t very good at keeping track of those things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s common. Okay, no known specific eye conditions. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Okay… Well, I work as a dental assistant, so I'm on my feet a lot. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t really do much exercise, I’m afraid. I should probably get around to that, but… work keeps me busy. Do you want to know about anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good picture. Now, before we do a quick examination, I just want to clarify something. You said the sensitivity started about three months ago. Has anything changed in your environment or routine around that time?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… Not really, no. I didn’t start any new medications, I haven't traveled anywhere… Hmm… Actually, now that I think about it, the clinic I've been working at did switch to brighter LED lights about two months ago. They said it was more energy efficient. Maybe that has something to do with it? I hadn’t really connected the two things until just now. Could that cause something like this?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Arbin. Brighter LED lights could definitely be a contributing factor. Okay, let’s do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to check your vision, look at your pupils, and just take a look inside your eyes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. I appreciate you taking the time. Let’s get started whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me, please. And try to relax. First, I'm going to have you read the letters on this chart, starting with both eyes. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let me see… uh… S… H… P… T… Yes, those are the letters, right? I think I can see them okay, but they seem a little… fuzzy around the edges. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, a little fuzziness isn’t unusual. Okay, let’s try this line. What do you see here?
PATIENT: Uh… L… N… F… C… Oh, this is getting harder. The letters are… blending together a bit. I have to really concentrate to make them out. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll keep going. Right eye… 20/30… Left eye… 20/40. Alright. Now I'm going to shine a light in your eyes. This won’t hurt, just look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, I’m going to use an instrument to look inside your eyes… just to check the retina. It might be a little bright, but try to stay still. Hmm... I see some minor retinal drusen, which is common with age, but nothing immediately concerning. No sign of any inflammation or bleeding.
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn’t too bad, Doctor. A little bright, but manageable. So, what do you think? Is it serious? Is it the lights at work, maybe? What should I do? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin, let’s not jump to conclusions. Based on the exam, there’s no indication of anything immediately serious. Your vision is a bit reduced, but that could be explained by a number of factors, and the retinal drusen are a common finding with age. It is quite possible that the brighter LED lights at work are contributing to your sensitivity. They can cause glare and strain. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, I'd like you to try wearing a good pair of sunglasses, even indoors, to see if that helps. Second, let's try to minimize your exposure to those bright lights as much as possible. Perhaps talk to your employer about adjusting the lighting if feasible. Third, I'm going to prescribe you some lubricating eye drops to help with any dryness or strain. And finally, I want to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your vision and see if there's any improvement. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, please don’t hesitate to call. I’d also like to recommend a consultation with an optometrist for a comprehensive eye exam. They can do more detailed testing and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, actually. A little reassuring to hear it’s not something serious, thank you. I’ll definitely try the sunglasses and talk to my boss about the lights. Eye drops are a good idea too, my eyes do feel a bit dry sometimes. And I'll schedule the follow-up and see about getting an appointment with an optometrist. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should be looking out for? And, uh, thank you again, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Just keep an eye out for any significant changes in your vision – blurred vision that doesn’t improve with rest, double vision, floaters, or any pain in your eyes. If you experience any of those symptoms, please contact me immediately. Also, make sure you're getting enough sleep and staying hydrated, as that can also contribute to eye strain. Here’s your prescription for the lubricating eye drops, and here’s a referral to a local optometrist. They’ll be able to do a more thorough evaluation and rule out any other potential causes. I’ve also noted everything in your chart and scheduled your follow-up appointment for three months from today. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your help. I really appreciate it. I'll schedule the optometrist appointment as soon as I can and try those sunglasses. Have a good day, Doctor Galena.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day as well. .
