DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It's this… stuff. Coming out. You know. When I… go to the bathroom. It’s black. Like… tar, almost. And it’s not normal, is it? I take those pills, the ones for my arthritis, every day. Been taking them for years, and now this is happening. I just want to know what’s wrong with me and if I need to stop the pills. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: “Stuff,” you say. Black, like tar. Very well. While I appreciate brevity, Ms. Hatchard, a little more precision would be helpful. Are you referring to your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Yes, Doctor, I’m talking about my stool! What else would I be talking about? Honestly, you’re a doctor, you should know these things. It’s… well, it's what comes out the other end. Black. Tarry. Is that precise enough for you? I’m not a scientist. I just know it doesn’t look right and I’m worried it’s those arthritis pills. Can we just figure out if I need to stop taking them? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. “Tarry” is a helpful descriptor. And you're concerned about a potential link to your arthritis medication. We will address that. Now, has this been a one-time occurrence, or has this been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been a few times now, Doctor. Not just once. Maybe… three or four times in the last week? It comes and goes. Some days it’s normal, some days it’s… that. And it’s getting me quite upset, honestly. I don't like things being different. Everything was fine before I started all this medicine. Are you sure it’s the pills? Because if it is, I’m not sure what I’m going to do. My arthritis is awful without them.
DOCTOR: Three or four times in the last week… and you associate the onset with the arthritis medication. Alright. Now, aside from the color change, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you mean? Changes? Well… it's a bit looser than usual, maybe? Not terribly, but… yes. A bit runny, sometimes. And I’ve been a bit… gassy, if you must know. Honestly, Doctor, I don't come to you for polite conversation. I just want to know what's causing this and if I'm going to be alright. Is it something serious? Because I read things on the internet, and… well, you know. It's never good.
DOCTOR: The internet. Yes, a reliable source. Loose stools and increased gas… I see. And have you noticed any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. A bit of cramping, mostly. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. It’s lower down, you know, in my tummy. Comes and goes with… well, with everything else, really. It’s hard to explain. Look, is this something to worry about? I’m 73 years old! I don't need to be worrying about… whatever this is. Can we just get to the bottom of it? I have a bridge game this afternoon. A very important bridge game.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I will need to palpate your abdomen and, if you'll excuse me, I will require a stool sample for analysis. This will help determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any serious underlying conditions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Fine. Get it over with. And a stool sample? Honestly. But yes, I understand. Just… try to be quick, alright? And please, don't tell me about every little thing you find. I don’t need a lecture. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do. The bridge game starts at one. And I never lose.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on the table. I will begin with the abdominal palpation. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Not alarming, but worth observing. Now, regarding the stool sample… the nurse will provide you with the necessary container and instructions. It’s essential to collect a fresh sample, if possible.
PATIENT: Oh, this is quite unpleasant, isn’t it? All this poking and prodding. I suppose it’s necessary, but still. And a fresh sample? Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking a lot. Fine. Just tell me where the nurse is, and let’s get this over with. I have a reputation to uphold at that bridge game. And if I’m late, Mildred will never let me hear the end of it. She’s a terror, that one. A complete terror. Just… hurry up, alright?
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in momentarily with the collection container. In the meantime, let's briefly review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Pills, creams, injections… never had a problem. I think. Maybe a bit of a rash once, a long time ago, but it went away on its own. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of every little thing that happened when I was young. I have more important things to remember. Like my bridge scores. And Mildred’s terrible cheating habits. She always tries to peek at my hand. It’s disgraceful, really. Just… focus on the black stuff, alright? That’s what’s bothering me. Not childhood rashes.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... just the little water pill the doctor gave me for my ankles. They swell up sometimes, you see. And... oh, yes! A bit of something for my heartburn. It flares up after I have a nice cup of tea. But that’s it. Nothing else. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a complicated woman. Just a bit of tea, a bit of pills, and a very important bridge game. And now, this… black stuff. Can we please just get to the bottom of this? I’m starting to feel quite impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I've gathered sufficient information for now. The nurse will be in with the collection container. Once the stool sample is analyzed, we will have a clearer picture of the underlying cause of your symptoms. Based on your description, the possibilities include a reaction to the medication, an underlying gastrointestinal issue, or even dietary factors. However, I will not speculate without the lab results. I’m also noting the mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. While I understand your desire for a quick resolution, I must emphasize the importance of thorough investigation. Do you have any questions before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Just one. Will I be able to play bridge if… if it’s something serious? That’s all I care about. Can I still play bridge? Because if I can’t, I’m going to be very upset. And Mildred will never let me hear the end of it. She thrives on other people's misfortune. Just tell me, yes or no, can I still play bridge? That’s all I need to know. And hurry up with that nurse! I have a game to win. .
DOCTOR: I cannot provide a definitive answer to that question at this time. It depends entirely on the diagnosis, which we will determine after the lab results are available. Nurse! We are ready for the collection container. .
