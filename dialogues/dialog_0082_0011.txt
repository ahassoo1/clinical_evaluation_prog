DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… yes. Well, I got a… a thing I wanna get done. A clearance, they called it. For somethin’… cosmetic. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s just get to it, alright? Some folks said I needed a doctor to say it’s… safe. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure. I understand wanting to get straight to the point. Just so I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little more about what procedure you’re considering?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… personal. It’s a little touch-up, alright? Some folks get it, some don’t. Don’t need to know what it is, just need a piece of paper sayin’ I’m… sturdy enough to handle it. I’m a strong man. Always been strong. Worked on them towers my whole life, you know. Radio stuff. Don’t fall off towers easy. What kinda questions are these, anyway?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Mr. Honcoop. It's just that even a "touch-up," as you call it, carries some risk, and my responsibility is to ensure your safety. Knowing the type of procedure helps me assess those risks accurately. But alright, if you're not comfortable sharing specifics right now, that's your decision. Let's put that aside for a moment. Could you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? I… I get by. I ain't sick, if that's what you’re askin’. Used to be real strong. Still am, mostly. Had a little trouble with my… somethin’. My stomach, maybe? A few years back. But it passed. Doc didn't say nothin’ serious. Don't have insurance, so I didn’t bother with it much. Don't believe in all them doctors much anyway. Waste of money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about healthcare costs, Mr. Honcoop. And it’s good to hear you generally feel well. You mentioned some stomach trouble a few years ago. Do you remember what specifically was bothering you?
PATIENT: Ugh. It was… somethin’ I ate, I think. Bad shrimp, maybe? Or somethin’. Just… upset stomach. Real bad for a week or so. I took some… pills. Red ones. From the drugstore. Helped a little. It’s over now, though. Long gone. Don’t dwell on the past, Doctor. Now, can we get this paper I need? I got things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. We can certainly proceed. To get a better sense of your overall health, even briefly, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, besides those red pills you mentioned?
PATIENT: Medications? I… I don't take medications. Not regularly. Those red pills were just for that one time. Like I said, stomach thing. I don't like bein’ full of pills, makin’ me all… sluggish. I’m a workin’ man, Doctor. Need to be sharp. Don't need no medications. Never really been one for them. Now, are you gonna give me this clearance, or what? I ain't got time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And you’ve said you generally feel well. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat… regular food. Sometimes shrimp, sometimes not. Never had no trouble. Maybe a little sniffles sometimes when the weather changes, but that’s everybody, ain’t it? Look, Doctor, I’m a simple man. I climb towers, I fix radios, and I don’t go around sniffin’ and wheezin’. Can we please just get this over with? I don’t understand why I gotta answer all these questions. It’s a touch-up, not open-heart surgery!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you've told me about your general good health. Just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history?! Now you want to know about my family? Doctor, seriously? What’s that got to do with a little touch-up? I ain't got time for geneology! My mama… she was fine, I guess. Worked in a diner. My daddy… he… I don’t even remember much about him. Didn't talk about family much. It's over and done with. Honestly, I’m starting to get a headache. Can we just skip this part? I just need a signature, Doctor. That’s all. A simple signature. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. I truly do. However, to responsibly assess your suitability for any procedure, even a minor one, I need some basic information. It's not about distrusting your self-assessment, but about fulfilling my duty of care. Given your reluctance to provide detailed information, and without a more thorough medical history or physical exam, I cannot in good conscience provide a clearance at this time. It would be unethical and potentially unsafe. However, I can offer a basic physical exam – checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and listening to your lungs – which might give me a minimal level of confidence to proceed with a limited clearance. Would you be willing to allow that?
