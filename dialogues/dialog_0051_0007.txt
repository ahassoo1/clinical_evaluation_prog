DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That is why I am here. I would like to be quick, if that is alright. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. I'll do my best to be efficient. “Painful” is a bit broad, though. Can you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: It is in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started… well, I’m not certain exactly when. A few weeks ago, perhaps? It comes and goes. When I bend, or lift things for work… that is when it hurts the most. It feels like… a dull ache, but sometimes sharp. Like something is pulled. Is that… understandable?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly understandable. A dull ache with sharp flares when bending or lifting… that gives me a starting point. And you mentioned it's been a few weeks. Has anything specific made it worse over those weeks?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Work is… work. Lifting fence posts, stretching wire… I do the same things every day. It just… started hurting more with those things. I didn’t change anything I was doing. I keep trying to ignore it, but it is getting harder. Medicare… does it cover things like this? I don’t want a big bill.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover a good portion of the evaluation and treatment, Ms. Reihner. We have a team that assists with navigating the coverage details, and they can help with any billing questions. Don't worry about that right now. Let's focus on your back. When you say it hurts, where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Right… in the small of my back. Not higher up, not my shoulders… right here. And sometimes it feels like it goes down my leg a little. Just the right leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… down the back of it. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pain radiating down the leg is important information. It sounds like it could be related to the nerves in your back. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. I'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and do a few simple tests. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. If it will be quick. I have posts to fix. And wire to stretch. I just want to know what is causing it. And if it will go away. I don’t want to be… slowed down.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll keep it as efficient as possible. I'm hoping we can pinpoint the cause and get you back to work comfortably. Okay, if you could lie down on the examination table for me, face up. First, I'm just going to gently feel along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. But please, be gentle. It hurts even to move.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that’s it. Right there. It’s a sharp pain. Not constant, but when you press… yes. It’s uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Stop, please. Just… stop. It’s enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm stopping right away. I apologize for that discomfort. That was helpful information, though. It indicates some tenderness in that area. Now, I'd like you to try and gently lift your right leg, keeping it straight. Just as high as you comfortably can. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg as you do that.
PATIENT: Ooh… that hurts. Down my leg. Not all the way, but… yes. Right there. It feels like… a pulling sensation. I can’t go any higher. It hurts too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. That's important information. It sounds like we may be dealing with some nerve involvement, possibly sciatica. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Could you bend your knees and let your feet dangle?
PATIENT: Sci… what-ca? Is that bad? I don’t understand all this… medical talk. Is it serious? I just want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down your leg. It's often caused by compression of the nerve. The good news is, most cases of sciatica are not serious and can be managed with conservative treatment. But we need to rule out anything more serious. Okay, now I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your leg. Your reflexes seem a little diminished on your right side, which can also indicate nerve involvement. I'm also going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: It feels… weak. It’s not as strong as my other hand. I’ve been doing this work a long time… my hands should be strong. Is this… the sciatica? Is this why I can’t lift as much? It’s slowing me down. And I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. It’s good that you’re noticing these changes. The diminished strength, along with the pain radiating down your leg and diminished reflexes, does suggest some nerve compression. Based on what we've discussed and the physical exam, it's likely you have sciatica, potentially caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. However, to confirm this, I recommend an MRI of your lower back. It will give us a clear picture of what's going on. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An… M…R…I? Is that… painful? Does it take long? And will Medicare cover that? I don’t want a lot of tests. I just want to know what is wrong and how to fix it. If it’s going to take weeks… no. I can’t wait weeks. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. An MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It’s a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or surgery. It doesn’t use radiation, and it’s not painful. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it takes about 30-45 minutes. It can be a little noisy, but it’s generally well-tolerated. Medicare should cover it, yes. We can verify that for certain before scheduling. The MRI will give us a definitive diagnosis, which will allow us to create a targeted treatment plan. Without it, we're mostly guessing. If the MRI shows a significant disc herniation or stenosis, we may consider a referral to a specialist—a neurosurgeon or orthopedic spine surgeon—to discuss further options. But often, conservative treatment—physical therapy, pain management—is all that's needed. Would you be willing to consider getting an MRI?
PATIENT: Fine. If it’s not painful. And it doesn’t take all day. And Medicare covers it. But I want it done quickly. I can’t be out of work for long. Just… get it done. When can we schedule it? And can someone explain the results to me? I don’t understand all this… medical language. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. I understand. We can schedule the MRI for as soon as possible—let me check availability at the imaging center. I believe they have openings next Tuesday or Wednesday. And I will personally explain the results to you in plain language. We can go over everything together, and I'll answer any questions you have. Let me see… Tuesday at 10 AM looks good. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… alright. 10 AM. As long as it doesn’t take long. And I need to know if Medicare will cover it before I go. Don’t want any surprises. And… can I still see you after the MRI? To explain the results? I don’t want to be stuck with some other doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday at 10 AM it is. I'm making a note right now to have our billing department contact you to confirm your Medicare coverage before the appointment. You won't be scheduled without that confirmation. And yes, absolutely. You will see me after the MRI to discuss the results. I will personally review the images with you and explain everything. I wouldn’t have you see anyone else. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Just… get the MRI scheduled. And make sure Medicare covers it. And I want to see you afterwards. That’s all. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. I’ve got it covered. I'll have the scheduling department contact you shortly to confirm the appointment details. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Have a good day, and try to take it easy until then.
