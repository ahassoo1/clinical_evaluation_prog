DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the chest. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it started maybe a week ago? Not sure exactly. It comes and goes. When I walk, sometimes it gets worse. And if I’m… excited, you know, like when my grandson visits, it feels funny too. Not sharp, just… heavy. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the words for it.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Sherion. Heavy and brought on by activity or emotion. That’s helpful. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Sometimes… yes. My left arm, mostly. It feels… numb, kinda. Not always, but when the chest feels really tight, the arm does too. And… now that you mention it, my jaw feels a little achy sometimes on the same side. But I thought it was just from… chewing maybe? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain to the left arm and jaw. We definitely want to look into that further. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I get a little short of breath, but I walk a lot, so I thought it was just that. And… I get a little sweaty sometimes, but it’s been hot, you know? August is always warm. Oh! And I feel a little… dizzy sometimes, but that doesn’t happen often. I take my blood pressure at home, and it’s usually okay. But maybe I’m just noticing things more now that the chest hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, sweating, and occasional dizziness. And you monitor your blood pressure at home, that’s good. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a pill for that. Just one a day. And… I had a little bit of trouble with sugar once, but the doctor said it was fine after I lost a little weight. Nothing else, really. Oh! Except my knees. They bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re on medication for high blood pressure and had a brief issue with your blood sugar that resolved with weight loss. And some knee pain. Medicare is helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… years ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was… oh, maybe twenty years ago? And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago too. Nothing else that I can remember. Mostly just the usual doctor visits, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist in the past. And now, just routine doctor visits. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve taken lots of different pills over the years, and never had a problem. My husband, he’s allergic to bee stings, but not me. I eat everything!
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have heart problems – like heart attacks, strokes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had a heart attack when he was older. And my mother, she had high blood pressure, like me. My brother, he’s fine, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much. But heart trouble… yes, on my father’s side.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your father and high blood pressure in your mother. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. My husband used to smoke, but he stopped years ago. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. And definitely no drugs! I’m a good Colombian woman, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Okay, Sherion, based on what you’ve told me – the chest tightness, radiating pain to your arm and jaw, shortness of breath, dizziness, and family history – it's important we rule out any serious heart issues. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and get an EKG done. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s going on. My grandson, he worries about me, you know? I want to be healthy for him.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll get everything set up. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, we’ll do a quick EKG. It’s a painless test – just some stickers on your chest.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… not too bad. Stickers, you say? I’m a little nervous, but I trust you. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not terribly so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of a murmur. Not alarming, but something we need to investigate further. Now, let's do the EKG. Just relax, and try to lie still.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm trying to relax. It feels… cold, these stickers. Is everything okay? You said something about… irregular? Should I be worried? My husband always worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. The machine is recording now. It’s just a quick snapshot of your heart’s electrical activity. The “irregular” rhythm I heard could be nothing, or it could be a sign of something we need to address. That’s why we’re doing the EKG – to get a clearer picture. The machine will print out a report in a few moments. Just a few more seconds…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm just… waiting. It's funny, I never thought I'd be here worrying about my heart. I just want to go home and make arepas for my grandson.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, the EKG shows some signs of… what we call atrial fibrillation. It’s an irregular heartbeat, as I suspected. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it does increase your risk of stroke and can cause other complications. You see here, the rhythm is quite erratic. Based on this, and your symptoms, I’m going to recommend a consultation with a cardiologist – a heart specialist. They will perform further tests – like an echocardiogram – to assess the health of your heart and determine the best course of treatment. We also need to start you on a blood thinner to reduce your stroke risk.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A heart specialist? Blood thinner? That sounds… serious, Doctor. What does this mean? Will I have to have surgery? I don't like the sound of that. And a blood thinner... won't that make me bleed if I cut myself? I make arepas, you know, lots of cutting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sherion. It is a bit overwhelming, but let’s take it one step at a time. The cardiologist will determine if you need any procedures or surgery – that’s not something we know right now. And yes, blood thinners do increase your risk of bleeding, but we manage that carefully with regular monitoring and by being cautious. We'll discuss the risks and benefits thoroughly. The most important thing is to get this under control to prevent any serious complications. We’re catching it early, which is good. I'm going to put in a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a very good cardiologist at the hospital. I'll also print out some information about atrial fibrillation and blood thinners for you to take home. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you here in a week to discuss everything and answer any questions you have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Dr. Ramirez… that sounds good. A week… that gives me time to think. And the information… yes, please. I like to read things myself. I just… I don't want to worry my grandson. He gets upset so easily. Will I be able to still make arepas? That's important, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. We’ll work with you to make sure you can continue to do the things you enjoy, including making arepas. We’ll discuss ways to minimize your risk of bleeding, like using caution with knives and letting me know if you’re taking any other medications. Here’s the information about atrial fibrillation, a list of common questions to ask the cardiologist, and a sheet outlining the precautions you should take while on a blood thinner. I've also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you with me next Thursday at 10:00 AM. Do you have any questions for me right now before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s… a lot of information. Thank you. Let me see… Will this… this atrial fibrillation… will it get worse? And the blood thinner… is it a pill? I don't like taking pills. My husband always says they make you feel worse.
DOCTOR: Those are both excellent questions, Sherion. Atrial fibrillation can sometimes progress, but it’s also manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. We’ll monitor your condition closely and adjust the treatment as needed. And yes, the blood thinner is typically a pill – Warfarin or one of the newer medications like Apixaban. I understand your concern about taking pills, and we can discuss potential side effects and ways to minimize them. We will find the best option for you. For now, just focus on getting the consultation with Dr. Ramirez scheduled. He will be able to give you a more detailed assessment and answer all of your questions. Do you have any trouble getting transportation to the hospital?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My son, he drives me everywhere. He worries too, you know? He'll take me to see Dr. Ramirez. Okay. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I just need to… process everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. It’s my job. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’re here to help. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of today’s visit for you to take home as well. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. And enjoy making those arepas! It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. .
