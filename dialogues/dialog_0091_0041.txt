DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. It started a long time ago, but now it's harder to do things. Walking, mostly. And my hands… they aren’t as strong as they used to be. My wife, Lani, she says I need to get it checked. She worries.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astore. It’s good that you’re here, and it’s very thoughtful of your wife to encourage you to come in. Weakness that progressively worsens is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this weakness started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been so long… I think… maybe ten years ago? It started with just a little trouble with my balance. I didn’t think much of it at the time, just figured I was getting old. But then it started spreading… to my legs, then my arms. It’s been slow, very slow, but it’s definitely gotten worse over the years. I don't remember exactly when it started, but a long time now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astore. A gradual onset over ten years is helpful information. And it's quite common for these things to develop slowly. Now, when you say it's gotten worse, can you describe how it's worse?
PATIENT: Well… it’s harder to walk without stumbling. I need a cane sometimes, especially on uneven ground. And my hands… they get tired easily. I used to be able to fix things around the house, build things… now, even holding a cup of coffee can be difficult some days. It’s like they don’t listen to my brain anymore, you know? Like there’s a… a disconnect. It’s frustrating. And tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Astore. A disconnect between what you want to do and what your body is able to do is certainly concerning. To get a better picture, could you tell me if this weakness is present on both sides of your body, or is it more noticeable on one side?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think it’s… both sides, but maybe a little worse on my left side. My left leg feels heavier, and my left hand is weaker. But it’s not like one side is completely useless, you understand? It’s just… more noticeable on that side. It comes and goes, too. Some days are better than others, but it's always there, lurking, you know? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Astore. It sounds like it’s a fairly symmetrical weakness, but perhaps more pronounced on the left. The fact that it fluctuates – some days are better than others – is also important information. Now, I’d like to ask a few broader questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, my vision gets blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but it happens. And I get tired easily, even when I haven’t done much. Lani says I’ve been more forgetful, too. But I’m an old man, Doctor! Maybe that’s just age. I also… sometimes I feel numb, like pins and needles, in my hands and feet. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts, Mr. Astore. Blurred vision, fatigue, forgetfulness, and numbness in your hands and feet are all important pieces of the puzzle. To clarify the vision changes, are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, Doctor. Not constant. They usually happen when I'm tired, or if I get stressed. It's like a… a fog over my eyes. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes. It's not painful, just… annoying. It makes it hard to read sometimes. And I don't like driving when it happens. I always pull over and wait for it to clear. It's been happening for a few years now, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. That’s very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on medicine, and it’s been under control for years now. Other than that… no, not really. I used to be very active, played football in my youth, but that was a long time ago. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, to be honest. But this… this weakness is worrying me. It's different.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the controlled high blood pressure, Mr. Astore. And it’s encouraging to hear you’ve been generally healthy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. And I broke my arm playing football, but that didn't require surgery. Other than that, no, I haven't been hospitalized for anything serious. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? Nothing major. I've been very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Astore. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had… something with her nerves, I think. She had trouble walking when she got older, similar to what I’m experiencing now. My wife, Lani, she says it might have been Multiple Sclerosis, but we never really knew for sure. My father was healthy as a horse, strong until the very end. And my siblings… they’ve had the usual things – heart problems, arthritis – but nothing like this. It's hard to say, you know? We didn’t talk about these things much in my family.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. That information about your mother’s condition is particularly relevant. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I always believed in taking care of my body, you see. Played sports, ate healthy… tried to live a good life. That's why this weakness is so puzzling.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Astore. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. Lani always checks, of course, but I haven’t had any problems. I think that’s everything, isn't it? You’ve asked a lot of questions! I hope it helps you figure out what’s going on with me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Astore, that is very helpful. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and balance. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs and check your vision and some cranial nerves. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. Just… be gentle, please. This weakness makes things a little difficult, you know? But I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is well-controlled. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. That's normal. Now, I'm going to test your strength in your arms and legs. Could you please resist as I try to move your limbs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ll try my best to resist. It might be a little harder on my left side, as I said. But I’ll do what I can. Just… tell me if I need to stop, please. This weakness sometimes makes things unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Grip strength is 5/5 in the right hand, and 4+/5 in the left hand. Slightly reduced on the left, but still good. Now, I'm going to test your biceps strength. Biceps strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, let's move to your legs. Quadriceps strength is 4+/5 in the right leg, and 4/5 in the left leg. Hamstring strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Dorsiflexion and plantarflexion are also slightly reduced on the left side, 4+/5. Now, I'm going to check your coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s a little harder than it used to be, you know? Especially on this side. I feel a little… unsteady. But I’m trying my best. I hope that was okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Astore, that was perfectly fine. I appreciate your effort. There is some mild incoordination on the left side, as you noted. Finally, I'm going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: It’s… harder than it used to be, Doctor. I need to focus to keep my balance. And my left leg feels a little… draggy. It’s not a comfortable walk, I can tell you that. I feel a little unsteady, like I might fall.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. That was very helpful. Based on the physical examination, I’ve noted some mild weakness in your left extremities, slightly reduced reflexes, mild incoordination, and a somewhat unsteady gait. Now, given your history and the physical exam findings, I’d like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies to help determine the cause of your symptoms. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function tests, and an MRI of your brain and cervical spine. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? This uncertainty is… unsettling. An MRI… is that safe? And will it be uncomfortable? I just want to be prepared. But yes, please do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Astore. It’s good you’re asking questions. An MRI is very safe. There is no radiation involved. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will be quite loud. We will provide you with earplugs or headphones. It requires you to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. You’ll also need to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry or watches. We will have you complete a questionnaire to ensure you are safe for the procedure. The results of these tests will help us rule out various conditions and determine the most appropriate course of treatment. While we await the results, I’m going to recommend physical therapy to help maintain your strength and balance. I will also prescribe a cane for you to use as needed to prevent falls. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. Physical therapy… that makes sense. And a cane… I’ve been thinking I might need one anyway. Anything to help me stay steady. So, physical therapy and a cane… and then we wait for the test results? How long will that take, roughly? And will someone contact me when they’re available? I just… I like to know what to expect, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Astore, that’s correct. Physical therapy and a cane for now, while we await the test results. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Our office will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as sudden weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or changes in vision, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think… I think that’s everything for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and I appreciate your patience. I just… thank you. For listening, and for taking the time. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about this. I’ll wait for the call. And I’ll try to be patient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have my thanks.
