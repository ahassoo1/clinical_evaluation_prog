DOCTOR: Good morning. I'm Dr. Murtic. Please, have a seat. So, Mrs. Sciarrotta, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it’s about getting a card. A driver's card, for ride-sharing. I understand I need a medical check for that now? I want to keep driving, you see. It helps me stay busy.
DOCTOR: A medical card for ride-sharing… yes, the regulations are getting more… involved. Alright. So, it's not so much about feeling unwell, it's a requirement for the license, then?
PATIENT: Exactly. It's a requirement. And frankly, a bit of a hassle, but necessary. I'm in perfectly good health, Doctor. Just… getting older, that’s all. I've been driving for years, professionally and otherwise, and never had an incident. I just need the piece of paper to say I’m okay to continue. Do you need a long list of my medical history, or…?
DOCTOR: Well, “perfectly good health” is relative, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Even if you feel fine, we need to do a basic assessment to ensure it’s safe for you – and for your passengers. It's not just about past incidents, it’s about current function. I'll need to go through a standard medical questionnaire and do a quick physical exam. It's fairly routine. First, let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I understand, I suppose. Routine is good. Let me think… Chronic conditions… Well, my knees aren’t what they used to be. Arthritis, yes, Doctor, in both knees. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been controlled with medication for… oh, fifteen years now, maybe longer? Other than that… nothing major. I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was… a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Arthritis in both knees, controlled hypertension for fifteen years, and a hysterectomy. Okay. We’ll need to get specifics on those medications for the blood pressure, but we’ll get to that. The hysterectomy… less relevant now, but good to know. And how severe is this arthritis?
PATIENT: Well… it's not crippling, Doctor. I can still walk, and I do walk, a lot. It aches, especially in the mornings or if I've been standing for a long time. Sometimes it gets swollen, and a little stiff. I take over-the-counter pain relievers when it’s bad, ibuprofen mostly. It doesn’t stop me from driving, though. Honestly, being in the car is usually easier on my knees than being out of it. Is that helpful? I don’t really… grade my pain, you see. It just is.
DOCTOR: “Just is” isn’t very helpful, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I need some concrete information here. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your typical knee pain is when you're not taking medication?
PATIENT: Oh. Zero to ten. Hmm. Okay. Well, when I’m not taking anything… on a bad day, maybe a six? Sometimes. Other days, it's more like a three. It really depends on the weather, and how much I’ve been moving. Honestly, a three or four is most common. And when I’m driving, like I said, usually closer to a two, maybe even a one. I’m trying to be accurate, Doctor. This is… frustrating, though. I’m not used to quantifying everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six being the worst, three being most common, and down to a one or two while driving. Noted. Now, let’s talk about these medications for your blood pressure. What are you taking, and what's the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… I’ve been on this for so long… It’s Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day, every morning. And I also take Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams, also once a day. I’ve been on both of those for… at least ten years, probably closer to fifteen. I get them refilled automatically through the pharmacy, so I don’t always remember the exact details. My doctor… Dr. Ito… he handles all of that. I just take the pills. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg, both once daily for 15 years. That’s better. Do you experience any side effects from those medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… side effects. Let me think… Not really. Sometimes my ankles get a little swollen, especially if it’s hot. And I get… a little bit of dizziness when I stand up too fast, but it doesn't last long. Nothing major, honestly. I’ve been on them so long, I just assume that's… normal. Is that something I should be worried about? I’ve never mentioned it to Dr. Ito, to be honest. I just… deal with it.
DOCTOR: Ankle swelling and dizziness on standing… those are potential side effects of those medications, Mrs. Sciarrotta, and we should definitely be aware of them. They can indicate fluid retention or low blood pressure. It's good you mentioned it. Alright. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, let's talk about your daily activity level. Besides driving, what else do you do on a typical day?
PATIENT: Well… I like to garden, when the weather is nice. Not heavy lifting, mostly weeding and planting. And I walk my little dog, a shiba inu, a couple of times a day. Short walks, though, maybe ten or fifteen minutes each time. I also do crossword puzzles. Keeps my mind sharp, you see. And I watch a lot of television. I don't… get out as much as I used to. My knees, you know. It limits things. Is that enough detail? I’m not exactly an athlete, if that’s what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Gardening, walking a small dog, crossword puzzles, and watching television. Alright. That gives me a general idea. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Then I'll take a look at your knees. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Sounds… thorough. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I’m not a fan of doctors, you see. Never have been. But I understand it's necessary, for the card. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll document it. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Okay… There. That’s about as far as they go, Doctor. It’s… not comfortable. They feel a bit stiff. And there's a little bit of swelling on the right one, I think. It's hard to tell. Is that what you’re looking for? Do you need me to move them in any way? It’s just… they’re not very cooperative today.
DOCTOR: I see some mild crepitus with knee flexion, and there is some slight swelling on the right knee, as you mentioned. Range of motion is limited, particularly with extension. No acute signs of inflammation, but there’s tenderness along the medial joint line on both sides. Ankles do show mild pitting edema bilaterally. This is consistent with your report of swelling. Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I have enough information for now. We'll need to review these findings and discuss a plan.
PATIENT: A plan? What kind of plan? Does this mean I won't get the card? I need that card, Doctor. I rely on driving. What are my options? Will I need to see a specialist? I just want to keep driving. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarrotta, please remain calm. It doesn't necessarily mean you won't get the card. However, based on these findings – the elevated blood pressure, the knee arthritis with limited range of motion, and the ankle edema – I have some concerns. The ideal course of action would be to get a more thorough evaluation of your knees. I recommend a consultation with an orthopedist. They can assess the extent of the arthritis and recommend appropriate treatment. I’m also going to recommend some lifestyle modifications, including a low-sodium diet and regular, low-impact exercise, to help manage your blood pressure. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home and keep a log. As for the card, you may need to provide documentation from the orthopedist before it can be approved. I'll write a referral for you now. I would also advise against continuing to drive until you've been evaluated by the specialist. It's not about restricting you unnecessarily, it’s about ensuring your safety – and the safety of others.
PATIENT: An orthopedist… another doctor. More waiting. I suppose… I suppose that makes sense. But this is going to be a hassle. A huge hassle. And what if the orthopedist says I can't drive? Will I have to stop completely? I just… I don’t know what I’ll do. Can you… can you write a note saying I’m still safe to drive, just until I see the specialist? Just a temporary thing? Please? I’ve been driving for so long, I’ve never had an accident. I’m a very careful driver.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarrotta, with all due respect, I cannot ethically provide a note stating you are safe to drive when I have legitimate concerns about your physical condition. That would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. My primary responsibility is to ensure your safety and the safety of the public. I understand this is frustrating, and I’m sorry for the inconvenience. But I must adhere to medical guidelines and prioritize your well-being. Here’s the referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected orthopedist. He will conduct a thorough evaluation and provide a definitive assessment of your knee condition. I will also provide you with a list of resources for low-impact exercise and blood pressure management. Until you receive clearance from Dr. Ramirez, I strongly advise against driving. I understand that may be difficult, but it's the safest course of action. I'm happy to answer any further questions you have, but I will not compromise my professional judgment. Do you understand?
