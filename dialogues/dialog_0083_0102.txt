DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Randolph. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, it's just… I find myself sighing a lot lately. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, just… a lot. My daughter, she said I should come get it checked. She worries. I don’t really know why I'm doing it, to be honest. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand, Randolph. It’s good of you to come in, and it’s always wise to listen to your daughter when she expresses concern. Sighing frequently can be due to many things, and it’s good we're looking into it. Just to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you started noticing this increased sighing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start…? That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t all at once, you see. I think… maybe a few months ago? Hard to say exactly. Time gets away from me these days. It feels like it’s been longer, but my memory… it’s not what it used to be. I mostly notice it when I'm… just sitting, I suppose. Quiet moments. Not when I'm busy.
DOCTOR: I see. A few months, more noticeable during quiet moments. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be. Have you noticed any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: Well… yes, a little. Sometimes I forget names, even people I’ve known for a long time. And I misplace things… my glasses, mostly. Though, to be fair, I’m always misplacing my glasses. My daughter says I repeat myself sometimes, too. Not big things, you understand. Just… little slips. It doesn’t bother me too much, but I suppose it’s something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory lapses – forgetting names, misplacing things, and occasionally repeating yourself. Thank you for sharing that, Randolph. It's good to have a complete picture. Now, besides the sighing and memory changes, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... other symptoms? Let me think. I get tired more easily these days. Used to be able to work all day without a problem, you know? Now I need a little nap in the afternoon sometimes. And… maybe a little bit of sadness now and then. It's not like I'm depressed or anything, just… wistful, I suppose. It's been a long life. My wife… she’s been gone a long time now.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, and a sense of sadness or wistfulness, especially related to the loss of your wife. That’s completely understandable, Randolph. Grief can manifest in many ways, even years later. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a question. Let me see... I think I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back. The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the way they made me feel. Besides that… not much, I don't think. I’ve been pretty healthy all my life, actually. Always worked hard, ate good food, that sort of thing. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but you stopped taking it due to side effects. That’s important information. And you haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that much I remember. A long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a small operation on my knee a few years after that, when I was working as a policeman. Tore something, I think. But that’s it, I believe. Nothing major. They didn't do much fancy surgery back then, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and surgery on your knee. That's helpful. Now, Randolph, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, she lived to be a very old woman, but she had some trouble with her heart towards the end. My father, he was a strong man, but he had… what was it… diabetes, I think. And my sister, she had some sort of sickness with her mind, when she was older. Something the doctors couldn’t fix. But that’s about all I remember. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk much about sickness in those days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so family history of heart problems, diabetes, and some cognitive decline in your sister. Thank you. Now, Randolph, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I used to be very busy, you know. I was a policeman for a long time. First-Line Supervisors of Police and Detectives, that was my job. Worked hard, long hours. Always something going on. After I retired, things slowed down a lot. Now I mostly stay home. My daughter comes to visit, and I have a few friends I see now and then. But mostly, I just… relax. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is good. And I like to listen to the radio. Nothing much exciting, but it keeps me busy enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A busy career in law enforcement followed by a quieter retirement. Now, Randolph, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose when the flowers are blooming, but nothing serious. I can eat most anything. My wife used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. She was always worried about me eating something bad, but I always bounced back.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, Randolph, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Like I said, I stopped taking the pills for my blood pressure a long time ago. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my memory, but I haven’t done that yet. I just figure it’s part of getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Randolph, thank you for providing me with all of this information. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple tests to assess your memory and balance. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just take it easy on me, alright? I’m not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Randolph. We’ll take everything at your pace. First, let's just sit here and I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/85. Not critically high, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Nothing concerning at the moment, but we'll want to monitor that as well. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s do a few simple tests to check your memory and balance. I’ll ask you a few questions, and I'll have you do a few simple tasks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Sounds good, Doctor. I’ll do my best. My mind isn't what it used to be, so don’t be surprised if I stumble a bit.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Randolph. Everyone’s memory has its moments. This is just to get a baseline. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Hmm... the current date… August… it's August, isn't it? Let me think… … the second, I believe. August the second. Is that right? I always get confused with the dates these days.
DOCTOR: That's right, August the second. That’s good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the year… … I believe it's… 2024? No… wait… is it 2025? I get so mixed up. My daughter says it’s 2025. Yes, I think it's 2025. But I’m not completely sure.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Randolph. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with dates. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three simple words. Please listen carefully: apple, table, and penny. Repeat them back to me after I finish. Then I’ll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and penny. Yes, I can do that. Apple, table, penny. Let me see… apple, table… is penny a kind of flower? No, that’s not right… Apple, table, penny. I think I’ve got it.
DOCTOR: Good, you repeated them back correctly. Now, let's move on to something else. Can you tell me why you came to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Why did I come…? … Well, my daughter said I was sighing too much. Deep breaths, you know? She worried about me. I can’t really remember why I was sighing, just that she thought I should get it checked. It's been on my mind, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Randolph. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your memory and thinking. This will just help me get a better understanding of how things are going. What is the name of the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the President… … That’s a tricky one. I used to know all about politics, when I was a policeman. But now… everything is a blur. Is it… Biden? I think his name is Biden. But I’m not sure. I read something about it in the newspaper, but I can’t quite recall.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Randolph. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling names. Now, let’s try something different. Can you tell me the name of your daughter?
PATIENT: My daughter…? Oh, that’s easy! Her name is… Mai. Yes, Mai. Lovely girl. Always looking after me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Randolph. Mai is a beautiful name. Now, finally, I want you to try and recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Do you remember them?
PATIENT: Three words…? … Oh dear. I’m trying… I really am. It's on the tip of my tongue… … I can't recall them. I’m so sorry. Apple…? No… I can’t remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Randolph. Don't worry about it at all. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things, especially as we get older. Okay, that concludes the quick assessment. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it seems you're experiencing some cognitive changes, including memory lapses and difficulty with recall. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and there’s a slight murmur to your heart. I'd like to order some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. And I think it would be helpful for you to undergo a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation with a specialist – a neurologist – to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot. Blood work, an EKG… and a specialist… … Is it something serious, Doctor? I just want to be able to relax and enjoy my life. I don’t want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Randolph. It’s natural to be worried when you hear about tests and specialists. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what's going on. These tests are simply to gather more information so we can get a clearer picture and develop the best plan for you. It could be something simple, or it could be something that needs further attention. Either way, it’s best to be proactive and investigate. The goal is to help you maintain your quality of life and address any potential concerns. I will arrange for the blood work and EKG to be done here at the clinic. And I will provide you with a referral to a neurologist. I can also discuss the results with you and help you understand what they mean. Would you like me to go over the list of tests and what they will involve?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I like to know what’s happening, you see. And… what does a neurologist do, exactly? I’ve never seen one before. And… will it cost me a lot of money? I don’t have much insurance, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with the tests. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw. We'll be checking your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin B12 levels. This will help rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your memory and thinking. As for the EKG, it's a non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It's painless and takes only a few minutes. Now, a neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They can diagnose and treat conditions such as stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and neuropathy. They'll conduct a more in-depth evaluation of your cognitive function and can help determine the cause of your memory lapses. Regarding the cost, I understand your concerns about insurance. Unfortunately, I don’t have the exact cost information for the neurologist appointment. However, I will have my staff contact the neurologist’s office to inquire about their fees and if they offer any financial assistance programs for patients without insurance. We can also explore options for reduced-cost care at local hospitals or clinics. I will do my best to help you find affordable care. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that's very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. It’s good to know you'll help me with the cost. It worries me to think of being a burden to my daughter. … Alright. I suppose I should go see the neurologist, then. And get the blood work done. If it helps, I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Randolph. I'm glad to hear you’re willing to try. I truly believe that getting a proper evaluation is the best course of action. My staff will schedule the blood work appointment for you. They will also provide you with the referral information for the neurologist. I will also give you a written summary of our conversation today and the tests we've ordered. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes. If you experience any sudden weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything. Thank you for being so kind and patient with me, Doctor. I appreciate it. It's nice to know someone is listening. … I think I’ll go home and take a nap now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Randolph. It was my pleasure to meet you and help in any way I could. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Get some rest and take care of yourself. We'll be in touch to discuss the results of your tests. It was lovely meeting you, Randolph.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor. … Thank you again for everything.
