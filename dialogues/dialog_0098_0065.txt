DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I've been… gaining weight. It’s rather perplexing, as my eating habits haven’t altered, and I am, generally, quite active with my work. I suppose that’s the most concise way to put it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight gain can be concerning, especially when your lifestyle hasn't changed. It’s good you’re addressing it. When you say "active with your work," could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an orderly at the local hospital. It’s… quite physical. A lot of lifting, moving patients, making beds—constant walking, really. I’m on my feet for nearly the entirety of my eight-hour shift, usually without much break. I’ve been doing this sort of work for… oh, nearly fifteen years now. It’s demanding, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years is a long time doing physically demanding work. That’s very helpful to know. And you said your eating habits haven't changed… could you give me a general idea of what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I usually have a light breakfast—perhaps a piece of rye bread with some cheese, and a cup of tea. Lunch is typically something I pack—a sandwich, maybe some fruit. And dinner… well, my husband usually prepares it; generally, it's a fairly traditional Lithuanian meal—potatoes, some sort of meat, perhaps a vegetable. Nothing extravagant, and certainly not excessive in portion size. I wouldn’t say I indulge in sweets or processed foods often, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good information. It sounds like you maintain a reasonably healthy diet, given what you’ve described. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Let me think. No, not really… except, perhaps, a slight increase in fatigue. It’s not debilitating, but I do find myself feeling more… drained at the end of the day than I used to. And I've been sleeping… well, perhaps a little more than usual. Though I attribute that to the increased workload at the hospital recently.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased fatigue and slightly more sleep… those could be relevant. Now, I'm going to ask some general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been… more regular, if that makes sense. Perhaps a bit too regular. It’s not painful, mind you, just… frequent. I hadn’t considered it significant enough to mention, but… yes, that has changed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It is helpful information. And you’re right to mention it; it can often be a clue. Now, have you experienced any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. My hair is… well, it’s always been rather fine, and it’s still the same. And my skin… I haven’t experienced any rashes, dryness, or anything of that nature. I generally keep a simple skincare routine—moisturizer, that’s all. Perhaps a slight increase in… feeling cold? But it is August, so it's difficult to say. It could just be the air conditioning everywhere.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to some medical history questions. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past—things like thyroid problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've always been rather healthy, all things considered. My family history… my mother had some issues with her joints in her later years, but nothing major. My father was a very robust man, lived to be eighty-seven without significant illness. I haven't had any serious illnesses or surgeries requiring hospitalisation, and I don’t take any regular medication. I do worry, naturally, with the weight gain coming on so suddenly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern; it’s good you’re proactive about this. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never experienced any adverse reactions to anything I’ve consumed or been exposed to. My husband always checks ingredients, just to be safe, as he has a mild sensitivity to certain shellfish, but I haven't any allergies of my own. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a practical woman, but… the unexplained weight gain is unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Reneisha, and I don’t want to alarm you. However, unexplained weight gain, fatigue, changes in bowel habits, and feeling cold can be symptoms of several things, including thyroid issues, as you rightly pointed out. Given your symptoms, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and general health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests are perfectly acceptable. I would, frankly, be relieved to have something done. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. When can we arrange that? And… will it be a long process? I have a rather busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can have the blood work done right here in the clinic lab, and it usually only takes about fifteen to twenty minutes. The results typically come back within a few days—usually two to three business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable. Two to three business days is… manageable. I appreciate that it won't be a prolonged wait. And is there anything I should do before the blood work? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For the most accurate results, it’s best to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. I’ll give you a slip with those instructions written down, just to be sure. Let me get the lab requisition form, and we can schedule the test for tomorrow morning?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning would be… excellent. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. This has been most helpful. I apologize for taking up your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Reneisha. It's my job. And you haven’t taken up any time—we want to address these things properly. I'll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment when you're done at the lab. If you experience any significant changes in your condition before your appointment—severe fatigue, dizziness, anything alarming—please don't hesitate to call us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. You have been very thorough and reassuring, Doctor. I am grateful for your attention. Thank you again. I will see you in a few days. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you then.
