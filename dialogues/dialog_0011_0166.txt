DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. I'm here because I’ve been having some numbness in my leg. It's…well, it’s been a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. Numbness can certainly be unsettling. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started about…oh, let me think precisely… July 18th, I believe. It began in my left foot, just a tingling sensation, really. Now it’s travelled up my leg, to just below the knee. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes. It’s more noticeable when I’ve been on my feet for a long time. I do a lot of work standing, you see, animating motion capture, and sometimes the stages aren’t the most comfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Kinjerski. That's helpful. So, it began July 18th in your left foot as tingling, and has progressed to numbness below the knee, exacerbated by prolonged standing. You mentioned your work involves motion capture animation; is that a physically demanding role aside from the standing?
PATIENT: It can be, yes. There's a fair bit of reaching, adjusting cameras and props, some lifting – nothing too heavy, usually under 20 pounds – and a lot of fine motor control work with the software afterwards. It isn't strenuous, per se, but it requires being very precise and focused for extended periods. And as I mentioned, the floors in the studio aren't always… forgiving.
DOCTOR: I see. That gives me a better understanding of your typical activities. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the numbness?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Thinking about it, there’s a bit of weakness in my left leg as well, though it's subtle. I wouldn't say I'm struggling to walk, but I do find myself tiring more easily at the end of the day. And sometimes… a slight burning sensation in my thigh. It's fleeting, though. Doesn't happen every time. I hadn't really connected it to the numbness until just now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kinjerski. The weakness and burning sensation are important details. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. No major illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, and I had my appendix removed when I was 12, but that was a straightforward procedure with no complications. I do have a bit of a family history of… well, my grandfather on my mother’s side had diabetes, type 2, I believe. He managed it with diet and medication, but it did cause some nerve issues towards the end of his life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Kinjerski. A history of diabetes in the family is relevant. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've eaten…well, almost everything. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. And no known drug allergies either. I've had the standard antibiotics a few times for minor infections – a sinus infection here and there – but never any issues. I did have a rather bad reaction to poison ivy once as a child, but that's hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that wouldn't be considered a medication allergy. That's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I do occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, maybe once or twice a month, but that’s it. I generally try to manage things with rest and hydration. I haven’t taken any supplements in years, not since I tried that spirulina phase in college. Didn't agree with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. That's very helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your professional judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably, legs dangling freely. I’ll be using a small reflex hammer. This shouldn't be painful, but let me know if it is uncomfortable. Your reflexes are…slightly diminished on the left side compared to the right. Now, I’m going to test your muscle strength. Could you please resist as I apply pressure?
PATIENT: Alright, I’m ready. Please proceed. I understand the instructions. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your strength is…slightly reduced in your left leg, particularly in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion – that’s the bending of your foot up and down. Now, I’ll assess your sensation. Close your eyes for me, please. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it, and where you feel it. Alright. Your sensation is…decreased in the lateral aspect of your left lower leg and foot. Finally, I'll palpate your spine and legs to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. There is some mild tenderness in the L5 and S1 region of your lower back. Overall, the examination suggests possible nerve compression in your lower back. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this.
PATIENT: I see. Nerve compression… that doesn’t sound particularly pleasant. L5 and S1, you say? Is that…serious? And what kind of further investigation are we talking about? I hope it doesn’t involve anything…invasive. I’m not overly fond of needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kinjerski. Nerve compression can be uncomfortable, but it’s often manageable with appropriate treatment. L5 and S1 are specific levels of your lower spine, and tenderness in those areas can indicate nerve irritation or compression. Regarding further investigation, the most appropriate next step would be an MRI of your lower back. This is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine and surrounding nerves. It doesn’t involve any radiation or needles. It will allow us to visualize the structures in your back and identify the source of the compression, if any. We can also consider nerve conduction studies and electromyography to assess the function of the nerves in your legs, but let's start with the MRI to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your spine first. Would you be comfortable proceeding with an MRI?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds… considerably less daunting than needles, thankfully. And yes, I believe that would be best. A clear picture is always preferable, as you say. What’s involved in getting one? Do I need to prepare in any way? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a fairly demanding schedule, and I’d like to plan accordingly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. An MRI is a relatively straightforward procedure. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, cylindrical machine. It’s important to remain still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. The machine can be quite noisy, so you’ll be given earplugs or headphones. Prior to the scan, you'll be asked about any metal implants or foreign objects in your body, as these can interfere with the magnetic field. You'll also need to remove any jewelry, watches, or clothing with metal fasteners. The scan itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. Regarding results, the radiologist will review the images and prepare a report. I typically receive the report within 2-3 business days. I'll then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. I can also provide you with a referral for the MRI and instructions on how to prepare. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. A referral and instructions would be greatly appreciated. 2-3 business days is manageable, thankfully. I can certainly work around that. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. You’ve alleviated a great deal of my anxiety. I appreciate your patience and expertise. So, if you could provide me with the referral and instructions, that would be wonderful. Then I can schedule the MRI as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Here is the referral for the MRI. The address and phone number of the imaging center are included. I'm also printing out the instructions now. These detail what to expect before, during, and after the scan. It’s important to follow these instructions carefully. Once you have scheduled the appointment, please let my office know the date and time, so we can anticipate the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been exceptionally helpful and informative. I will schedule the MRI right away and contact your office as soon as I have a date. I appreciate your time and expertise. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day as well. .
