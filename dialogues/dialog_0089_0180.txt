DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… this tiredness. It's just bad. And I keep… wanting to eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… feel like I need it sometimes. It’s embarrassing, okay? I don't know why I'm telling you this. It’s just… happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, I understand. It sounds distressing, and you’re right to get it checked out. It’s good you came in. The tiredness is something we can definitely explore, and… wanting to eat dirt – that’s unusual, and we’ll figure that out too. No judgment here, just trying to understand what’s going on. When you say “bad” tiredness, can you tell me more?
PATIENT: It’s just… all the time. Like, I could sleep for a week and still be tired. It’s not like… normal tired after a long day. It’s… heavy. And it doesn’t go away. I try to work, you know, program the machines… but I just can't focus. It’s… frustrating. My husband… he used to help, but… well. Nevermind that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a persistent, heavy fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest, and it’s impacting your ability to focus at work. That's helpful. And you said it's been impacting your work... how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… ugh. It feels like… months, maybe? Everything's a blur these days. Honestly, I stopped keeping track after… well, after everything. Probably at least three months. Maybe longer? I really don’t know. It just… crept up on me, I guess. One day I was okay, the next… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so at least three months of this progressive fatigue. That helps narrow things down. You mentioned it “crept up on you.” Were there any other symptoms around the time it started, even small things?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Ugh. Let me think… I’ve been… I don't know, a little more… short-tempered, I guess. My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, keeps asking about my garden and I just… snapped at her. I never do that. And… my stomach's been off. Not… sick, exactly, but just… unsettled. And I've lost weight, I think? My clothes feel looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, so short temper, unsettled stomach, and clothes feeling looser – potential weight loss. Good. Let’s talk about the stomach issues a little more. Is it nausea, diarrhea, constipation, bloating… anything specific?
PATIENT: No, not… diarrhea. Thank goodness. Just… queasy sometimes. Like, before I eat. And sometimes after. It’s not… bad enough to throw up, just… uncomfortable. And bloated. Yes, definitely bloated. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t. It just… feels full, even when I haven’t eaten much.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness before and after eating, and a feeling of bloating even with limited food intake. And you mentioned the dirt craving earlier… has that been happening the whole three months, or did it start more recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't remind me. It started… maybe a month ago? A month and a half? It's weird, okay? I just… get this feeling. Like something's missing, and… the dirt helps. Not like I go out and eat it from the yard, but… I found some clay. Little bits. And… it just… feels right. Don’t look at me like that!
DOCTOR: I'm not judging at all, Hedy. It's unusual, and that's why we need to figure out what’s going on. Okay, so the dirt craving started more recently, about a month ago. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: No! Just… that. Don’t ask me about ice or anything, I don’t eat weird stuff. Just the dirt. And… I’ve been really thirsty, I think? I’m drinking more water than usual. But maybe it's just the weather, it's been hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst along with the fatigue, stomach issues, and dirt craving. Alright. Now, let's go over some more general questions. Do you have any past medical problems – like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Let me think. My husband… he was the one who kept track of all that. I… I had something wrong with my… gallbladder, a long time ago. They took it out. And I had… pneumonia, once. A bad one. But that was ages ago. Nothing else that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of pneumonia. Good to know. Any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No. Just the gallbladder. Honestly, I don't like doctors. Never have. That’s why I waited so long to come in. It's just… a waste of time, usually. They ask a lot of questions and don’t do anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I'm going to try to make this as efficient as possible. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t take anything. Never have. I’m not one for pills. My husband used to try to get me to take something for my… nerves, but I refused. All those side effects… no thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. Never had one. I eat pretty much anything. Except maybe licorice, I don't like that. But that's a preference, not an allergy. Honestly, I'm perfectly healthy. Well, except for the tiredness and the… dirt thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s talk about family history. Are there any significant medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family… My mother had… something with her heart, I think? She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But he didn’t take care of himself. Always eating sweets. That's about all I remember. They're both gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. Do you know if anyone in your family had issues with their thyroid or anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? Thyroid? Honestly, I have no idea. My family wasn't one for talking about… health stuff. My aunt… she was always sickly, but I don’t know what she had. She died young too. Everything’s just a blur. It’s been so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Are you serious? I’m a perfectly respectable woman. I wouldn't dream of doing any of those things. My husband… he used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never touched the stuff. No, no, no. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, what about your work?
PATIENT: I program machines. CNC machines. You know, the ones that cut metal and things? It's… precise work. Or, was precise work. It's hard to concentrate when you're exhausted. It’s in a shop… lots of noise. I used to like it, but now… It’s just stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, CNC machine programming. Sounds demanding. And you said it's noisy… Okay, one last thing for now. I need to ask about your height and weight. Would you mind stepping on the scale and telling me your height?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do we have to? Fine. I'm… about 5'5". Maybe a little shorter. And… I weigh… look, don't judge me. I’ve put on weight since my husband… It’s around 185 pounds. Okay? There, happy? It's none of your business, really.
DOCTOR: It's important for me to get a complete picture, Hedy. It's not about judgment, it's about your health. Okay. Alright, Hedy. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and maybe take a look at your skin. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Honestly, this is taking forever. But yes, just… hurry. The faster we finish, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, a little fast, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is… slightly tender in the upper quadrants, but no masses. Skin is dry. I also notice some paleness. Okay, Hedy. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, there are a few things I want to investigate further. The fatigue, weight loss, stomach issues, dirt craving… these are all concerning. The paleness and dry skin could be related to iron deficiency, and the dirt craving… well, that’s called pica, and it can be a sign of nutrient deficiencies. I want to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, iron studies, thyroid function tests, and a few other things to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests? Seriously? More poking and prodding? Fine. But don't tell me I have anything serious. I don't want to hear it. Just tell me what I need to do, and let's get it over with. I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, I understand your concern. We're just gathering information at this point. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. The blood tests will help us rule things out. Here’s a requisition form. You can go to any lab, but these are the ones covered by your insurance… though you mentioned you weren't insured. We can discuss options for that. The form has the address and phone number of a few nearby labs. Just take this to the lab, and they'll draw some blood. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Once we get the results back – usually takes a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to eat a well-balanced diet. If the dirt craving is strong, try to resist it, but if you do consume it, try to limit the amount. We want to figure out what’s causing this. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ugh, well-balanced diet? Easy for you to say. What about the clay? Is it… dangerous? Is that what you're going to tell me? I don't want to have to go to the hospital. And no, I don't have any questions. Just get me the results, and tell me what I need to do. I need to get back to work. And I really don’t have time for this. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. The clay...consuming clay can be harmful. It can cause constipation, intestinal blockage, and even lead to lead poisoning if the clay isn’t pure. It’s also a sign that something is missing in your diet, or potentially a more serious underlying issue. That’s why we need to run these tests. Here’s a pamphlet with more information about pica and iron deficiency, as well as some resources. I'm scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in five business days. That will give the lab enough time to process the results. The receptionist will call you to confirm a time. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or constipation, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Five days. Emergency room. Okay, okay. I get it. I'll try to… avoid the clay. But don't expect miracles. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. Just… normal. Is that too much to ask? Just get me the results, and let’s hope it's nothing serious. I have things to do, you know. No, I don’t need anything else. Just… goodbye.
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask, Hedy. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Thank you for coming in today. We'll be in touch. Goodbye, Hedy. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
