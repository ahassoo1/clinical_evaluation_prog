DOCTOR: Right. Well, Evann Buoniconti, 35 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand you assist with… plans for the future, should something unexpected occur? I believe my solicitor suggested I inquire about a form… an Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST, was the other term mentioned. I confess, the details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, solicitors do like their jargon, don’t they?
PATIENT: They certainly do. I apologize for the confusion. I’m quite… disorganized, generally. I simply want to ensure my wishes are known, should I be unable to communicate them myself. It’s… a preventative measure, I suppose. I don’t recall anything specific prompting this now, but it felt… important to address.
DOCTOR: Preventative, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. Though, as to what I’m preventing… that’s proving elusive. I’ve been… reasonably healthy, I believe. No major incidents, at least that I recall. It was more a feeling… a sense that things should be in order. My ex-husband… he was quite insistent on preparedness, and I suppose some of that… stuck. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, truly. I don't even know where to begin with these forms.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's not get bogged down in embarrassing admissions. It's responsible, if a bit… proactive, for someone with no immediate concerns. So, to clarify, you're interested in documentation of your wishes regarding medical care, should you become incapacitated?
PATIENT: Precisely. Incapacitated… yes, that is the correct term. And… what does that entail, exactly? I mean, what sort of decisions would these forms cover? I understand they’re quite comprehensive, but the details… they escape me. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Look, it covers everything from whether or not you want a breathing tube, feeding tube, CPR… basically, if you're in a situation where you can't tell us what you want, these documents tell us. It's not about predicting the future; it’s about respecting your autonomy. We'll go through each section. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing conditions… that’s a good question. I… I believe I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but it was quite mild. And… I occasionally experience migraines, though they’re generally manageable with over-the-counter remedies. Nothing… chronic, as far as I know. I haven’t seen a physician regularly in some time, I confess. I tend to avoid doctors if possible. Is there a form I should complete beforehand, detailing this information?
DOCTOR: Right. No major medical history. Excellent. We’ll fill out a standard questionnaire. It’s mostly paperwork, to be honest. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t believe so. Nothing significant, at least. I recall a slight reaction to a mosquito bite once, but that was years ago. And… I think I might have a mild sensitivity to certain perfumes, but it’s more of an annoyance than an allergy, truly. It causes a headache, if I’m exposed for too long. Is that the sort of thing I should note?
DOCTOR: Headaches from perfume… we're documenting life-threatening situations here, not sensitivities. Let’s move on. Medications?
PATIENT: Medications… just ibuprofen, occasionally. For the migraines, or if I strain myself. And… a multivitamin, to be sensible. Nothing prescribed, I assure you. Let me just… confirm. Yes, just the standard over-the-counter remedies. I believe that's all. I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite my… organizational shortcomings. Is there a specific type of information you’re looking for? Perhaps a list of past surgeries, though I haven’t had any, to my knowledge?
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Fine. Let’s get a basic physical done, just to have a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Standard procedure. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I must apologize in advance if my blood pressure is slightly elevated. I find doctors' offices… rather stressful. It’s a peculiar habit, I suppose. I’ll attempt to remain calm. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Not ideal, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Height is 183 centimeters, weight 123 kilograms. BMI is… significant. We’ll need to address that later. Any family history of heart disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Significant… I see. I confess, I’m not entirely certain about my family history. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and my father… he wasn’t forthcoming with such details. I believe there was some… heart trouble on my maternal grandfather’s side, but it was many generations ago. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, had a stroke, perhaps ten years ago? But he led a… rather unhealthy lifestyle, so I don’t know if it’s relevant. It’s all rather hazy, I’m afraid. I apologize for the lack of clarity. I never prioritized such things.
DOCTOR: Right. Vague family history. Unhealthy lifestyle. We'll proceed as if there is a risk. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. I find the habit… rather distasteful. I’ve never been inclined to smoke, nor have I ever been around it much. It’s… detrimental to one’s health, isn’t it? I prioritize clean air, whenever possible. My workshop… it’s quite well-ventilated, despite the fumes from the etching process. I avoid anything that compromises my respiratory system, if I can.
DOCTOR: Etching process?
PATIENT: Yes. I am an etcher and engraver. I create… images on metal plates, using acid and various tools. It requires a steady hand, and a keen eye for detail. It’s… a solitary profession, generally. Though, I occasionally take on commissions. It’s quite demanding, physically, despite the… artistic nature. It’s my passion, truly. Although, it does involve certain… occupational hazards.
DOCTOR: Occupational hazards… involving acid?
PATIENT: Yes. The acid is… essential to the process. I take all necessary precautions, of course. Protective gloves, ventilation, careful handling. But… accidents can happen. Minor burns, occasionally. It’s… part of the trade, I suppose. Although, I haven’t experienced any serious incidents in recent years. It’s… difficult to explain to someone unfamiliar with the craft. It requires a certain… precision, and a willingness to accept a degree of risk. Perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier.
DOCTOR: Perhaps you should have. We're documenting your medical history, Ms. Buoniconti, not your hobbies. Are you using any protective respirators?
PATIENT: Respirators… no, not a full respirator, precisely. I use a ventilation system, to remove the fumes, and I occasionally wear a mask, to filter out some of the particles. But… a full respirator? No. I haven’t considered it necessary, until now. It would… impede my work, somewhat. I strive to maintain a clean workspace, and I’m quite careful with the acid. Perhaps I haven’t been… diligent enough. I confess, I prioritize efficiency over absolute safety, sometimes. It’s… a flaw, I suppose. I apologize for not disclosing this information earlier. Is it… serious? Will this affect my health?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, you are regularly exposed to corrosive chemicals without adequate respiratory protection. This significantly increases your risk of lung damage, and potentially other health problems. We need to schedule a pulmonary function test immediately. And I strongly advise you to cease work until you have addressed this safety issue. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lung damage… cease work… Yes. I… I understand. It sounds… rather serious. I confess, I hadn’t realized the extent of the risk. I simply… enjoy my work so much. It’s my livelihood, and… my passion. A pulmonary function test… immediately? Very well. I will schedule it. And… I will cease work, as you advise. Is there… anything else I should be aware of? Will this affect my ability to… continue my craft in the future? .
DOCTOR: We'll see what the tests reveal. In the meantime, I'm referring you to a pulmonologist for a complete evaluation. And frankly, Ms. Buoniconti, you need to seriously reconsider your safety practices. This isn't a hobby; it’s a hazardous occupation. We'll discuss your Advance Directive after we have a better understanding of your overall health. Now, let’s get that referral scheduled. .
