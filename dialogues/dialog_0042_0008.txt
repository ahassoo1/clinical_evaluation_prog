DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, hello. It’s… my ear, I think. Feels blocked, full. Been like that a while now. Honestly, I can’t quite put my finger on when it started. It’s just… annoying, you know? I just want it to go away.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Annoying is a good way to describe it when something persistent like that is bothering you. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your ear. Could you describe the feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Like… pressure. Not painful, exactly. Just… stuffy. Like when you fly, maybe? But it hasn't gone away. And… sometimes it feels a little muffled, sounds aren't as clear. I don't know if that makes sense. I haven’t been on a plane recently, though. Not for years. I’m… not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Don’t worry about explaining; we’ll get there together. The feeling of pressure, like during a flight, is helpful information. And the muffled hearing too. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Not really. No pain, like I said. No… dizziness. I haven't noticed any discharge or anything like that. I think my hearing is okay, aside from being a bit quiet sometimes. Honestly, I’m not sure. I haven't really… paid much attention. My wife… she would always notice these things. But… well. It’s been a while. Is… is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure, and it's understandable that you've been preoccupied. We will take our time, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. No pain, dizziness, or discharge is good to know. And it’s alright that you haven’t noticed any changes in hearing specifically. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm… now that you mention it… maybe? Very faint. Not constant. I just figured it was… background noise. Or… getting older, I suppose. It's hard to say. Everything seems a bit quiet these days. I'm not sure if it's the ear or just… things. It’s a little frustrating, to be honest. I just want to be able to hear properly again. Is… is this something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it's good you mentioned the faint ringing. It's often a subtle symptom, and easy to dismiss. Let's not jump to conclusions about "serious" just yet. There are many potential causes for these symptoms – from something simple like earwax buildup, to a mild infection, or even fluid in the ear. We’ll need to do a quick examination to get a better idea. Do you have any allergies, or have you had any recent colds or sinus infections?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never really bothered with that sort of thing. Colds… I had a little sniffle a few months back, maybe? Nothing major, just a bit under the weather for a few days. Nothing like my wife used to get. She was always getting sick. And… sinus infections? I don't think so. I get headaches sometimes, but I just take some pills and lie down. Really, I'm not much of a sick person. Can we just… get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and a mild cold a few months ago. That’s helpful. I understand you’d like to get this over with quickly, and we will try to be efficient. To start, I’m going to take a quick look inside your ears with an otoscope. It doesn’t hurt, I just need you to stay still. Could you please sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Right. Yes. Just get it done, please. Hurry up, if you don’t mind. I… I really don’t have much time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m looking now. Alright, and now the other ear. I do see a bit of cerumen – earwax – buildup in both ears. It's not excessive, but it could be contributing to the feeling of fullness and muffled hearing. The eardrums themselves appear intact, but slightly dull in color. There’s no obvious sign of infection, which is good. I'd like to try a simple procedure to remove the earwax. It's called ear irrigation. It involves gently flushing the ear canal with warm water. It's usually quite effective and shouldn't be painful. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Irrigation… sounds… wet. Will it mess up my hearing? I need my hearing for… things. And will it take long? I really can’t be here all day. If it’s going to be a big thing, just… forget it. I’ll just live with the fullness, I suppose. It's not that bad. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Is there… is there somewhere I can sit down?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It’s perfectly alright to feel hesitant. Ear irrigation is a relatively simple and safe procedure. It can cause a temporary feeling of fullness or slight dizziness, but it's usually brief. And it rarely affects hearing long-term. I will be very gentle, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. The procedure itself should only take a few minutes per ear. You are feeling lightheaded?
PATIENT: Yes, just a little. It happens sometimes. I… I didn't eat much breakfast. And I get anxious at doctors, to be honest. All these… instruments. It just makes me nervous. But… alright. Fine. Let's just… get it over with. Quickly, please. And be careful. I really don’t want anything to go wrong. Is there a fan? It’s quite stuffy in here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious at the doctor's office, and I appreciate you letting me know. We’ll take our time, and I'll explain everything as we go. I’m going to adjust the temperature in the room and open a window for some fresh air. Is that better?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. That’s… much better. A little breeze is nice. Alright. Let's just… get on with it. Quickly, please. I have things to do, you know? Important things. And don't poke anything in my ear too hard. My wife always said I have sensitive ears.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I will be very gentle, I promise. I will explain each step as I go, and we can stop at any time if you feel any discomfort. First, I'm going to warm up the water to body temperature. Then, I will gently flush your ear canal with the water, using a controlled stream. It may feel a little strange, like a mild pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Here we go. Please lean your head slightly to the side.
PATIENT: Ugh. Cold! And… wet. Very wet. Stop! It's too cold! And it feels… funny. Like something's bubbling in there. Are you sure this is supposed to feel like this? This is awful! Stop it! Just… stop!
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I’m stopping right now. I apologize, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It seems the water was too cold, despite my best efforts. And it’s understandable that the sensation is unsettling. I clearly misjudged the temperature, and I apologize for causing you discomfort. We’ll stop the irrigation for now. Are you feeling dizzy or nauseous?
PATIENT: No, not dizzy. Just… annoyed. And wet. It’s just… not pleasant. Honestly, I don’t think I want to continue with this. It’s making me more anxious than I already was. I think I just want to go home. Can I just… go home? My ears are probably worse now. And I feel… shaky. Is there a chair?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Your comfort is my priority. We will absolutely stop, and you can go home. It was my mistake to not ensure the water temperature was comfortable enough, and I apologize again for that. Please sit down and take a few deep breaths. Would you like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Yes, water would be nice. Thank you. This… this has been awful. I just wanted to get rid of the fullness, not… this. Honestly, I think I’m just going to live with it. It’s better than being… wet and shaken. I… I don’t think I trust doctors anymore. And my wife always said I have sensitive ears. She was right. She was always right. .
DOCTOR: Here you are. Please take your time. I am very sorry for the unpleasant experience, and I understand your frustration and distrust. I should have been more careful and attentive to your needs. I will document everything that happened today, and I want to assure you that your concerns will be taken seriously. If you change your mind and decide you’d like to explore other options, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today. Please take care, and have a safe trip home. .
