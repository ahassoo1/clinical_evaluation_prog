DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… low. Very low. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nani. “Feeling low,” as you put it. We’ll certainly try to ascertain the cause and get you feeling better. To help me understand, could you elaborate on what you mean by “not yourself”?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… hard to pinpoint. Just a general lack of… joy, I suppose. Things don’t feel good anymore. Even things I used to enjoy. I’ve been… withdrawn, I think is the word. Spending a lot more time alone. And sleeping… too much, perhaps. Though not always restful sleep. It’s just… a weight, Doctor. A heavy weight. I hope that makes sense. I don’t usually bother with… feelings, to be honest. I’m a practical woman. But this has been going on long enough.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent lack of enjoyment, social withdrawal, and changes in sleep patterns… these are all pertinent details, Nani. It does sound as though this is impacting your quality of life. Now, to get a more complete picture, let’s go through some specifics. Approximately how long have you been experiencing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. I suppose… maybe six months, now? It started… gradually. I didn’t really notice it at first, just a little less enthusiasm for things. Then it… grew. It's been worse the last few months, certainly. I don't keep track of dates very well, if you understand. It all blurs together after a while. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is, Nani, it is. Six months of persistent symptoms is significant. And it’s perfectly understandable that dates become less clear when one is preoccupied. Now, have you experienced any other changes alongside this… lack of enjoyment?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… My appetite isn't what it used to be. I don't feel hungry as often. And I've lost a bit of weight, I suppose, though I haven't weighed myself recently. Oh, and… I get tired very easily. Even simple things, like walking up the stairs, leave me breathless. Is that what you mean by changes? I don’t think anything else, no. Not that I can recall, at least.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, weight loss, and fatigue… these are all concerning symptoms, Nani. Now, regarding your fatigue, can you describe it further?
PATIENT: It’s not just… normal tiredness, Doctor. It’s… draining. Like all my energy is being sucked away. I can sleep for eight hours, wake up, and still feel exhausted. It’s… a heavy feeling, physically. Difficult to describe. It makes it hard to… do things. Even things I need to do. And… I've been less patient, I think. Snapping at people more easily. I don't like that. I pride myself on my composure. This isn't like me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. A persistent, debilitating fatigue, coupled with irritability… these are all important observations. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I know of, no. I've always been a healthy woman. Very active, even now. Used to be a lifeguard, you know. Ski patrol in the winters. Though I've slowed down a bit, naturally. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing a bit of rest wouldn't fix. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, I think. But no serious illnesses. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Until now, of course. I prefer to keep things… simple. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Keeping things simple"... I see. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a child, climbing a mango tree, but that was just a cast and a sling. Nothing serious. I’ve always been very careful. Avoided unnecessary risks. I believe in looking after myself. Are we getting anywhere with this? I do have an appointment later this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: We are progressing, Nani, though a thorough assessment is necessary. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps depression, anxiety, heart disease, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... That's a difficult one. My mother… she was a very stoic woman. Didn't talk much about feelings. She had… trouble sleeping, I think. And she was often tired. But she attributed it to hard work. My father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my brother… he had some heart trouble later in life. But beyond that… I don't really know. We weren't a very close family, if you understand. Little communication. Is that helpful? I truly don't recall much detail. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. Limited family medical history is not ideal, but we'll proceed with what we have. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Are you currently married or widowed?
PATIENT: Divorced, Doctor. Years ago now. A long story, and not a very pleasant one. Let's just say we weren't… compatible. I haven’t remarried. Prefer my own company, mostly. I have a few acquaintances, but no close friends. I keep to myself, as I said. It’s… easier that way. Less complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. And do you currently use any tobacco products, consume alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Perhaps once or twice a week. For the health, you know? A little red wine is good for the heart. And as for… recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I am a practical woman, Doctor. I don't partake in such foolishness. Is that what you were getting at? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Simply gathering information, Nani. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every morning. For general health. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take some paracetamol. But that's it. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. Too many side effects, you know? I believe in letting my body heal itself, naturally. Is this nearly finished? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nani. Now, just a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And a quick neurological assessment. It won’t take long. If you'll just have a seat…
PATIENT: Oh. I… I wasn’t expecting a physical exam. I thought we were just… talking. I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding, you know. But… I suppose if you insist. Just please be quick, Doctor. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Just relax, and take deep breaths. Blood pressure is 148/92. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, if you’ll please lie back. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, but there is some mild crackling in the lower lobes of both lungs. Deep breath… again… Now, a quick neurological assessment. Can you tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Nani Derasmo. And… it’s August the 2nd, 2025. Must we go through all of this? I assure you, my mind is perfectly sound. I know who I am and what day it is. I'm a very capable woman, Doctor. This is… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nani. And I assure you, this is standard procedure. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes. I can see your finger. Perfectly clearly. Is there a point to all of this, Doctor? I have an appointment, you know. Honestly, I haven't felt this anxious in years. And I’m starting to suspect this is precisely why.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nani. Based on your history and the brief examination, there are several possibilities we need to explore. Your symptoms – persistent low mood, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, irritability, and some crackling in your lungs – could indicate several things. Given your age, it could be related to depression, though the physical symptoms are also concerning. The crackling in your lungs suggests a possible respiratory issue. I’m also noting slightly elevated blood pressure. To rule out any serious underlying conditions, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also recommend a chest X-ray to investigate the crackling in your lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an X-ray? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite a production. I came here because I felt… low, as I said. Not because I suspected I was riddled with ailments! But… … very well. If you insist. But please, let’s be quick about it. The sooner this is over, the better. And please, send the results to my home. I would prefer to avoid another visit if at all possible. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Understood, Nani. I will arrange for the blood work and chest X-ray immediately. The results will be sent directly to your home. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI, to address the low mood. It may take several weeks to see a full effect, and there are potential side effects, which I will detail in the prescription information. This is not a definitive diagnosis, but a trial of medication, coupled with the test results, will help us determine the best course of action. I would also recommend light exercise and social engagement, if you are able. I understand you prefer your own company, but even a brief walk or a phone call with a friend can be beneficial. Do you have any questions regarding the medication?
PATIENT: Medication? Absolutely not. I do not want medication. I told you, I prefer to avoid it whenever possible. Too many side effects, you know? I'd rather… just try to manage on my own. I appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I’m not taking any pills. And I certainly don’t need advice on socializing. This is… frankly, rather patronizing. Will you at least honor my request and not prescribe anything? I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nani. I respect your autonomy and will not prescribe medication against your wishes. However, I strongly advise against dismissing potential treatment options without careful consideration. The SSRI I mentioned is often very effective with minimal side effects. But ultimately, the decision is yours. I will proceed with the blood work and chest X-ray as requested. Once the results are in, we can discuss them further and explore other potential avenues, such as lifestyle modifications and, if you are open to it, referral to a therapist. I would also recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home. I will provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the test orders. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. I’m… quite overwhelmed, to be honest. Just… please send the results as quickly as possible. And I truly hope this is all it takes. Thank you for your time. Though I must admit, I'm not entirely convinced this visit was… productive. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nani. I understand your reservations, and I assure you, I will expedite the results. I hope they provide some clarity. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. I wish you good health, and I look forward to discussing the results with you.
