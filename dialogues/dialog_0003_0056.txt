DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Yackey. I see you’re 87 years young. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, the age is correct. Honestly, doctor, must we go through all of this? I simply… I am tired. Tired of everything, really. It’s this job. All these…students. Not applying themselves. It’s quite frustrating, you understand. A waste of my time, frankly. Let's just say I'm considering…retirement. But paperwork. The thought alone…
DOCTOR: Frustration with work is…certainly a common complaint. However, you’ve come to a doctor’s office, Mr. Schlatterer. I need to understand if this “tiredness” is simply a matter of annoyance, or if there’s a medical component we should address. Can you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: Medical component? Honestly, doctor, I haven’t the slightest. I sleep, I eat…well, I try to eat. It’s just…a general weariness. A lack of…enthusiasm. It’s not as if I'm ill, you understand. Just…old. Old and surrounded by incompetence. Is that a diagnosis? Perhaps you should prescribe more diligent students.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your…colorful description, “incompetent students” is not a recognized medical condition, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s try to be a bit more precise. When did this feeling of weariness begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it begin…? That’s…difficult to say. Years, probably. Decades, even. It's a gradual thing, you see. Not some sudden ailment. Honestly, doctor, I've been teaching for…a very long time. It all blurs together after a while. Perhaps it started when the library moved to that dreadful building? Or perhaps when they started letting anyone into university…It's really all quite tiresome to recall.
DOCTOR: Very well. Since pinpointing a start date is difficult, let's approach this systematically. Aside from this tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens, doctor, I am eighty-seven years old! What symptoms should I not be experiencing? Aches, pains, the occasional…forgetfulness. But those are just part of getting older. It's not as if I'm bedridden. Honestly, I expect a certain level of discomfort at my age. Are you expecting me to list every creak and groan? It’s…undignified.
DOCTOR: I am simply trying to gather information, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s try a quick review of systems, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? Well, yes. I eat less. Not because I'm sick, you understand. Simply…less interest. The food these days is…bland. And frankly, preparing a meal is rather tiresome. I used to enjoy cooking, you see. But now…it's all just rather pointless. Is this important? Honestly, I’d rather not dwell on my eating habits. It’s…private.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Schlatterer. Have you experienced any unintended weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Possibly. I haven’t weighed myself in…well, I can't recall the last time. My housekeeper used to, but… she left. Said I was too demanding. Frankly, I suspect she wasn't very good at her job. But weight loss... I suppose my clothes feel a little looser. But it’s hardly a crisis. Honestly, doctor, is this what you do all day? Questioning elderly people about their clothes and appetite? It's rather…demeaning.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Schlatterer. Now, are you having any difficulty with your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No! I am not gasping for air, doctor. I walk, I talk… perfectly normally. A little short of breath when climbing stairs, perhaps. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? I am not a young man anymore. Honestly, this is rather insulting. Are you implying I’m on the verge of collapse? It's…preposterous. I’ll have you know I used to hike in the mountains… a very long time ago, admittedly. But still! .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. It seems you are resistant to a proper medical assessment. I’ll document your reported fatigue, decreased appetite, and subjective weight loss. I recommend a follow-up with a specialist for further evaluation, specifically a geriatrician. Here is a referral. Please schedule an appointment at your convenience. .
