DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. I’m not entirely sure why it started, if that makes sense. It just… began.
DOCTOR: "Rather embarrassing," you say. Well, these things happen. It’s good you came in to get it checked. "More than usual" is vague, though. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… hmm. Let me think. Usually, it’s perhaps… four or five times a day? But now… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes even more frequently. Especially at night, which is quite disruptive. I apologize for not having a more precise number, it just… feels like all the time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Feels like all the time" isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. MacVittie. But it’s a starting point. And disruptive sleep is… inconvenient. Do you feel any burning or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No burning or pain at all. Just… the constant urge. It's not uncomfortable, precisely, just… frequent. And a bit worrying, if I’m honest. I don’t recall this happening before, and my memory isn't what it once was, so I can’t be sure if it has happened before. It’s rather frustrating, actually.
DOCTOR: "Frustrating" and "worrying" I can understand. Frequent urination without pain… well, it could be a number of things. Are you drinking a lot more fluids than usual?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I don’t believe so. Perhaps a little more water, with the warmer weather, but nothing drastic. I certainly haven’t changed my tea habit, and I drink a fair amount of tea. No, I don’t think my fluid intake has increased noticeably. Is there anything else you'd like to know? I'm trying to recall anything that might be relevant, but it's… difficult.
DOCTOR: Let’s see… and you said this started… recently?
PATIENT: Yes, recently. Within the last… oh, I’d say the last month, perhaps six weeks? It wasn’t a sudden change, more of a gradual increase in frequency. I wish I could give you a more precise timeline, but dates… they just seem to slip my mind. I apologize again for my lack of clarity. I’m usually quite organized, but this… this is different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, Doctor, not regularly. I used to take something for… well, it wasn't important. I stopped taking it years ago. Just the occasional pain reliever, if I have a headache. Nothing consistently. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Do you need to know what I take for headaches? It’s just over-the-counter ibuprofen, usually.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother… I believe my mother’s sister had something, but I was quite young at the time, and family discussions weren’t always… detailed. I think it was something with her blood sugar, but I can't be certain if it was diabetes specifically. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying close attention. I truly apologize. My family isn’t particularly forthcoming with medical history, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Not particularly forthcoming." Right. Well, we can’t rely on others if they aren’t willing to share. Alright. Now, Ms. MacVittie, I'm going to ask you a few questions, a bit more general, just to get a better picture. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. I’ve been reaching for water a bit more often, but I attributed that to the heat, as I said earlier. It’s not an overwhelming thirst, just… a bit more frequent sipping, if that makes sense. Nothing drastic, certainly. I hadn’t really connected it to the… bathroom situation, though. It's all rather confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Weight loss… Now that’s a question. I have been feeling a bit… less hungry lately, yes. And I think I may have lost a few pounds, but I hadn’t paid much attention. I've been rather preoccupied. And truthfully, my appetite isn't what it used to be. It’s not a deliberate attempt to lose weight, certainly. It just… seems to have happened gradually. Is that concerning, Doctor? I'm starting to feel a little anxious now.
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, I’m going to need to perform a quick physical exam and order a urine sample. We need to rule out a few things. While not necessarily alarming, these symptoms combined warrant further investigation. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I should have expected as much. A urine sample… and a physical exam. I haven't had one of those in years. I trust your judgment. Please, let me know what you’d like me to do first. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I need you to provide a urine sample. There's a restroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a sterile container, and I’ll explain how to collect the sample properly. Don’t drink anything for the next thirty minutes if you can manage it, so we get a concentrated sample. Then, we’ll move on to the physical exam.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thirty minutes without a drink… that might be challenging, but I can manage. A sterile container, you say? And instructions on collecting the sample… Yes, please. I wouldn’t want to do it incorrectly. Let me just… proceed down the hall, then. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Try to collect a mid-stream sample—that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the container, and finish urinating. That helps us avoid any contamination. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. “Mid-stream,” you say… I’ll do my best. It sounds… complicated, but I’ll follow the instructions as carefully as possible. I’ll be back shortly. Please, excuse me.
