DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be brief. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Brief is good. I don’t have all day. I just… well, I need a card.
DOCTOR: A… card, sir?
PATIENT: Yes. A get well card. Or… encouragement. Something like that. My niece, she’s… not doing so good. And she always liked cards. A little pick-me-up, you know? From the doctor. It means more.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, this is a medical practice. I provide healthcare, not… stationery recommendations. Are you experiencing a medical issue you require assistance with, or are we simply discussing greeting cards?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute. I came here because of my niece. She’s sick, very sick. And a little encouragement from a doctor… it helps. You think I enjoy being here? I have things to do. It's not like I want to bother you with this, but it would really mean a lot to her. It's… a nice gesture.
DOCTOR: Very sick… and you’re seeking a motivational note from me?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not asking for a miracle. Just… a card. With your name on it. It shows you care, you know? A little something to put by her bed. My ex-wife, she always said a kind word goes a long way. And coming from a doctor… it’s different. It has weight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you are concerned for your niece. However, my professional obligations lie with providing medical care, not fulfilling personal requests. Do you have any information regarding her condition?
PATIENT: Her condition… well, it’s… complicated. She’s got… something with her lungs. She’s been in and out of the hospital. I don't know all the details, to be honest. My daughter handles most of that. But it's serious. That's why a little… something… from a professional, someone who knows about these things, would be helpful.
DOCTOR: "Something with her lungs," you say. And you're unsure of the specifics?
PATIENT: Exactly. I'm not a doctor, am I? I just know she's… struggling. Lots of coughing. And tired. Very, very tired. My daughter tries to keep me updated, but… well, she works. Long hours. And she doesn’t like to worry me. So, I just… hear things. You understand? I just want to do something nice for her.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate your concern, I'm hesitant to offer a card based on such vague information. It's… inappropriate. Do you have any access to her medical records?
PATIENT: Medical records? No. No, I don’t have any of that. My daughter has them. I wouldn’t even know where to begin looking for them. Look, maybe this isn’t the right place. Maybe I should just go get a card myself. But it wouldn’t be the same, would it?
DOCTOR: Precisely. It wouldn't. Now, is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your health today?
PATIENT: No. No, that's… that's all. I just thought… well, never mind. It was a silly idea, I guess. Waste of your time.
DOCTOR: As it appears. I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your time, Mr. Kammer.
PATIENT: Yes, well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. A little kindness wouldn’t hurt. .
