DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy. Not painful, exactly, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks of generalized itching. That does sound frustrating. To get a better idea of what might be going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Hmm… it doesn’t seem to be worse at any particular time of day. And it’s not like, a rash or anything. Just… the skin feels itchy all over. I tried some lotion, just regular stuff, but that didn’t really help. I haven’t changed anything in my routine – same soaps, same laundry detergent, same everything. It started, I think, after I was doing some yard work, but I wasn’t bitten by anything that I noticed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, no rash, it's all over, hasn't responded to lotion, and it started around the time you were doing some yard work, though you didn't notice any bites. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itching – things like fever, fatigue, changes in your weight, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No fever, no tiredness more than usual, and my weight's been pretty steady. I actually checked it a couple of days ago, just out of curiosity, and it hadn’t changed. I feel… normal, besides the itch, of course. It’s just… persistent. I did have a bit of a cough last month, a little head cold, but that cleared up weeks ago. It wasn’t anything major.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No other symptoms, and the cough was resolved weeks ago. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. Other than that… not really. My wife, God rest her soul, she had some trouble with her heart, but that was her. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of, and haven’t been diagnosed with anything else. I get the usual check-ups, you know, once a year, and everything’s always been alright. I’m on Medicare, so they usually catch anything if there is something. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Well-controlled high blood pressure is good to know, and no known allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, must be fifteen years now. And a multivitamin, but that's it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it. I remember my wife... well, she had a whole cabinet full. It wasn’t pleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any skin conditions or allergies that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had eczema when she was a little girl, but she outgrew it. And my brother, he has hay fever, pretty bad every spring. Other than that… not really. My father was pretty healthy, and my wife’s family… I don’t recall anything specific. We didn’t talk about medical history much, to be honest. We were more focused on the present, I guess. It’s… hard to think about these things sometimes. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Eczema in your mother and hay fever in your brother. Okay. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now, as I mentioned, my wife passed a few years back. I keep busy, though. I do a lot of gardening, like I said. I walk a little bit most days, nothing strenuous. I used to be a carpenter, so I was very active then, but now it’s more gentle exercise. I don't smoke, never have, and I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. I eat pretty healthy, mostly home-cooked meals. Nothing too exciting, really. I try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Sounds like you're generally very healthy and active. Alright, Brendan, thanks for giving me all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this itch, you know? It’s driving me a bit crazy. I’m happy to let you take a look.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Let’s take a look. Could you please undress down to your waist and I’ll come back in a moment. I’ll be right outside. We'll start with a visual inspection of your skin and then I'll likely listen to your heart and lungs just to get a full picture.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'll just be here when you're ready. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you're uncomfortable at any point. It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright Brendan, thank you. Hmm… I’m not seeing any obvious rashes or lesions. Your skin is generally clear, and there’s no significant dryness. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged. It’s all quite normal, physically. I'm going to gently run my fingers along your skin to check for any subtle changes in texture or temperature. No tenderness or obvious abnormalities there either.
PATIENT: Okay. That's good to hear, I suppose. It's just… frustrating. It feels like something should be visible, you know? But if you don't see anything… What do you think it could be, then? Is it possible it's something internal? I’m just trying to understand what’s going on. This has been going on long enough to be worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Brendan. It is unsettling when things don’t present with obvious physical signs. The fact that the exam is normal is actually helpful, because it makes some of the more serious possibilities less likely. Given your history and the normal physical exam, the most likely culprit is a condition called idiopathic pruritus. "Idiopathic" just means we don't know the exact cause, and "pruritus" is the medical term for itching. It can be triggered by a lot of things – subtle changes in skin hydration, mild allergies, even stress or anxiety – and sometimes it just happens. However, because we can’t rule everything out with certainty, and to be on the safe side, I'd like to order a few blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, yes. If it rules things out, that’s good. Idiopathic… it’s just… unsatisfying, isn’t it? To not know why something is happening. But if you think it’s the best course of action, then yes, please. Blood tests are fine. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? I can handle that, if I need to.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It is frustrating when we don't have a clear answer. But sometimes, ruling things out is the best first step. You're right to ask about fasting. Yes, please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food after midnight tonight. You can drink water. And try to avoid strenuous exercise in the morning, before the test. We'll also need to take a urine sample, so please bring that with you when you come in. I'll write you a lab order now. You can go to any Quest Diagnostics lab location – they're pretty common. The results should be back in a few days. Once we have them, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, to help manage the itching, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day. Avoid hot showers or baths, as they can dry out your skin. And try to wear loose-fitting, cotton clothing. I can also prescribe a mild antihistamine if the itching is particularly bothersome. Would you be interested in a prescription for that?
PATIENT: Okay, 12-hour fast, no strenuous exercise, and a urine sample. I can manage that. And yes, please, a prescription for the antihistamine would be great. It's just… constant. I’ll try the moisturizer and loose clothing, too. Fragrance-free, you said? I need to read the labels carefully, I suppose. It’s… easy to forget these things. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismiss it as… nothing. It’s… comforting, actually.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right to be careful with the labels – fragrance-free is key. Here’s the prescription for Cetirizine, a non-drowsy antihistamine. You can take one 10mg tablet daily, as needed for the itching. I’ll also print out some information on managing pruritus and a list of fragrance-free moisturizers. The lab order is on this sheet as well, with a list of nearby Quest Diagnostics locations. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week, so we can discuss the lab results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, a week is fine. That gives me time to get the tests done and… try to manage it. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. It’s… a relief to have a plan, even if it's just to rule things out. I think that's everything, isn't it? I should probably go get those tests scheduled. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything for today. Just schedule the tests at your convenience. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I hope you find some relief from the itching. Have a good day, Brendan. .
