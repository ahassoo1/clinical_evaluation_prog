DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Like something's stuffed in there. It’s been… a little while now, I suppose. Honestly, time… it slips away.
DOCTOR: Okay, blocked ear. I understand. And you said “a little while now”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A while. Maybe… a few weeks? It’s hard to say exactly. Things haven’t been… clear lately. I just noticed it getting more… bothersome. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… full. It makes it hard to hear sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Not painful, just a feeling of fullness and difficulty hearing. I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I don’t think so. Maybe a little… dizziness sometimes, but I get that anyway. Old age, you know? It’s probably just that. I… honestly, I can’t recall anything else specific. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness as well. And that’s… a common thing for you generally, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, generally. It comes and goes. Not… with the ear, not that I’ve noticed. It’s… well, I get it when I stand up too fast, sometimes. Nothing new, really. I just figured the ear thing was… separate. Does that make sense? I hope I’m not… rambling. It's just hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s good you’re telling me everything. Now, let’s just quickly go over some basics. Any fever, discharge from the ear, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. No, definitely no fever. Discharge… no, nothing coming out of it. And ringing… maybe a little? Sometimes I hear a faint… hum? But it's quiet. I've had that on and off for years, I think. It could be the house. It’s an old house, lots of noises. Honestly, it’s hard to tell what’s what these days. Is that… useful? I’m sorry, I’m not being very precise.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing just fine, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. This is helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I haven't taken much medication lately. Years ago, I think I had a reaction to something… a rash, maybe? But I don’t remember what it was. My wife… she always handled the medications. It’s been… a long time. I… honestly, I’m not sure. Would that be a problem? Is it important?
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll proceed cautiously then. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, not currently. Just… some vitamins, occasionally. Nothing regular. Just when I remember. My wife… she used to remind me. It’s been… difficult to keep up with things since she passed. Sorry. Is that… relevant? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I appreciate you sharing that with me. And yes, it is relevant. Okay. I’d like to take a quick look in your ears now, if that’s alright with you. We’ll use an otoscope. It won’t hurt. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t hurt. I… I’m not good with… unpleasant things. But if you say it won’t hurt, I trust you. Please, be gentle. I… I just want this… blockage to go away. It’s making it hard to… hear my grandchildren on the phone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. This might be a little cool. Hmm. And now the left ear. Okay. I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – in both ears. It does appear to be quite impacted, especially in the left ear. It could very well be the cause of the blockage and difficulty hearing. No signs of infection, which is good. The ear drum looks intact.
PATIENT: Oh. Earwax, you say? Impacted? Is that… serious? I… I don’t know much about ears. Would… would removing it help? Is that what you think is causing the problem? I just… I want to be able to hear again. Especially my grandchildren. They grow up so fast.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, not at all. Impacted earwax is a very common problem. And yes, I strongly suspect it’s the cause of your symptoms. Removing it should definitely help. We can try a simple earwax removal procedure today. We'll use a gentle irrigation method. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Irrigation… is that… painful? Will it make me dizzy? I… I get dizzy easily, as I mentioned. I… if it’s going to be unpleasant, maybe we should just leave it. I can… just try to live with it, I suppose. I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be painful, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. And we’ll take it very slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. There is a small risk of dizziness, but we can stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable. We’ll use body-temperature water, and I'll tilt your head just right. We’ll have you sit up slowly afterwards. Would you like to try it, and if it’s too much, we can discuss other options?
PATIENT: Alright. If you promise to stop if I feel dizzy… and you’ll explain everything… then yes, let’s try it. I… I really would like to hear my grandchildren again. Just… please be gentle. And slow. Very slow. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I promise, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We will go very slowly, and I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort or dizziness. Now, I’m going to gently warm the water and explain each step as we go. First, I’m going to place a small basin under your ear to catch any excess water. Then, I’ll gently insert a small syringe into your ear canal and release a gentle stream of water. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… alright. A little strange is okay. As long as it doesn't hurt. And you'll stop if I say so, right? I... I'm just a little nervous. My wife always took care of things like this. It's… different now. But I trust you, Doctor. Let's get it over with. Slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m going to tilt your head slightly to the side now. Perfect. And now, I’ll gently insert this syringe into your ear canal. It’s okay if it feels a little cool. Now, I’m going to slowly release a small amount of water. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It… it feels a little strange. Kind of… bubbly. And a little cool, as you said. Not painful, just… weird. I… I can feel the water moving around. I… is this normal? I hope I'm not making a mess. I’m a little worried about… everything. I just want this to be over. Slow, please. Very slow.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. You’re not making a mess. The bubbly sensation is the water loosening the earwax. And yes, we are going very slowly. Do you feel any discomfort at all?
PATIENT: No, not discomfort. Just… a bit of pressure. Like something’s… shifting. It’s… hard to explain. Maybe a little… tickly? I think… I think it’s working. It feels a little different now. Not as… blocked. It’s… hard to tell. I’m just glad you’re being so careful. My wife… she would have liked you. She was very particular about things like this. Slow, please. Very, very slow.
DOCTOR: Good. I’m seeing some earwax coming out now, which is a good sign. Okay, I’m going to stop there for a moment. Let me gently dry your ear. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: It… it feels lighter. Definitely lighter. And… I think I can hear better. Not much, but… a little. It doesn’t feel as… stuffed. I… I think you did it. It’s still a little muffled, but… thank you, Doctor. That’s… a big improvement. I… I can almost hear my grandchildren. Almost. I… I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad we could improve your hearing. Now, let's do the other ear. We'll repeat the same process, slowly and gently. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Let's get it over with. Slowly, please. I… I trust you. Just… the same as before. Slowly and gently. I… I'm ready, I think. I… I hope it works as well on this side. I'm really looking forward to hearing my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m going to gently tilt your head to the side now. Perfect. And now, I’ll gently insert this syringe into your ear canal. Now, I’m going to slowly release a small amount of water. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… similar to the other ear. A little bubbly, a little cool. Not painful, just… strange. I… I think I can feel something shifting. It doesn’t feel quite as blocked as before, but… it’s still a little muffled. I… I can feel the water moving around. Slow, please. Very slow. Are we getting anywhere? I… I just want to be able to hear again.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are making progress, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m seeing more earwax coming out now. Do you feel any discomfort at all?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Just… a slight pressure. Like something’s… loosening. And a little tickly, as before. I… I think it's working better on this side, maybe? It feels a little more open already. I… I can almost hear you more clearly. Slow, please. Very, very slow. I… I just don't want anything to go wrong. My wife… she was always so careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m going to stop there for a moment. Let me gently dry your ear. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: It… feels much better. Definitely much better. Lighter, more open. And… I can hear! I can actually hear you more clearly. It’s not perfect, but… it's a huge improvement. I think… I think you did it. I… thank you, Doctor. That’s… wonderful. I… I can almost hear my grandchildren. I can almost hear their voices. I… I'm so grateful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m so glad we could improve your hearing. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions just to make sure everything is okay. Can you tell me your name?
PATIENT: Leander… Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s… a long name, I know. My wife always said it sounded… important. It’s… been a while since I’ve had to say it. Everything feels… a little clearer now. Not just my ears. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you know what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a difficult one. August… the second? I think. August second, 2025? Yes, I believe so. It's… hard to keep track of things these days. Things… blur together. But yes, I think that’s right. August second.
DOCTOR: Good. Very good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is normal and your lungs are clear. Overall, you're doing very well, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We successfully removed the impacted earwax. I recommend you avoid getting water in your ears for a few days, and if you experience any pain, dizziness, or hearing loss, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. Truly. I can almost hear my grandchildren again. That’s… that’s all that matters. Maybe I’ll call them later, just to be sure. And… thank you for being so patient. And gentle. It meant a lot. I… I really appreciate it. Is there anything I need to pay now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It was my pleasure. Hearing your grandchildren is the best reward. Yes, the receptionist will take care of your co-pay. They are just down the hall. And if you need anything else in the future, please don’t hesitate to call. And enjoy your call with your grandchildren! It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. I think I’ll go call them now. Just to be sure. .
