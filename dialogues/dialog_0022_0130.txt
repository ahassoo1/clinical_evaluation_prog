DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my sister… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mom, she… she had something bad with her stomach a long time ago. So, I just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Just peace of mind. It’s good to check, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It’s understandable to want peace of mind. So, to start, can you tell me a little more about what's been concerning you?
PATIENT: Concerning? Well… I don’t really feel sick. Not like my sister. But… sometimes I get a little tired. More tired than usual, maybe. And… uh… my stomach feels funny sometimes. Not pain, exactly. Just… unsettled. Like after you eat something bad. But I haven’t eaten anything bad, you know? It just happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some stomach upset. And you're saying this isn't related to anything you've eaten recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat… pretty normal. Toast for breakfast, sandwich for lunch… sometimes noodles for dinner. Nothing fancy. It just… comes and goes. A few days I feel okay, then a few days I don’t. It’s been happening… maybe a month or so? Hard to say exactly. I don't keep track of things so well.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. A month or so gives us a good starting point. And is this stomach upset happening after meals specifically, or at other times too?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… mostly after I eat. But sometimes in the middle of the night too. Woke up a couple times feeling… not sick, but… just not right. Not a bad pain, but… you know? Like something’s moving around in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it’s happening both after eating and sometimes at night. And you describe it as more of an unsettled feeling, like something moving around, rather than pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Not pain. Definitely not pain. Just… uncomfortable. And… sometimes a little bit of gas, I guess. Old man problems, maybe? I don’t know. I used to be able to eat anything. Now, everything feels… different.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. It’s not necessarily “old man problems,” and it’s good we’re talking about it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – things like changes in your bowel habits, weight loss, fever, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Thank goodness. And… weight loss… I don’t think so? I haven’t been weighing myself. My wife… my ex-wife, she used to make me weigh myself. But not anymore. Bowel… uh… everything seems… normal there. Maybe a little… softer sometimes. But nothing too bad. I don’t want to bother you with all this…
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Mr. Schwer. It’s important to get a full picture. So, softer stools occasionally, but no significant changes otherwise. And you mentioned your sister’s illness and your mother’s stomach problems. Do you know what your mother was diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh… um… not exactly. Something with her stomach. She was sick for a long time. Lots of doctors. She… she passed away a long time ago. My sister… she has… cancer of the… the insides. I don't know what it's called, I don't understand those words. She’s getting… treatment, but it’s hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's a lot to cope with, and it's completely understandable that you'd be concerned about your own health given your family history. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… a long time ago, he said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me some pills. I took them for a while, but… I stopped. I didn't like taking pills. And… nothing else, I don’t think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe ten years? Longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you were previously treated for, but stopped taking medication for. And you haven’t seen a doctor in ten years or more. What about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. When I was little, I had my tonsils out. That's it, I think. No hospitalizations… not really. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing serious. Never been a sick man, you know? Until now, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… water. And sometimes tea. I used to drink coffee, but it makes my stomach upset. So, no pills, no vitamins, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Alright, Mr. Schwer. Just to clarify, you're 73 years old, and your weight is… 53 kilograms. That's… quite low. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… 53? Is that… low? I haven’t weighed myself in a long time, like I said. I used to be bigger. But… yeah, I guess I have lost some weight. Not on purpose, though. Just… doesn’t feel like eating much these days. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Yes, 53 kilograms is on the lower end for someone of your height. And the unintentional weight loss is something we need to investigate. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s alright. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know if something’s wrong. My sister… she didn’t catch hers early enough. I don’t want that to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Alright, Mr. Schwer, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some deep breaths for me, please. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise, lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. I notice some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no obvious masses. Your blood pressure is a bit high – 145 over 85. And your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be common at your age, but we'll want to keep an eye on that. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately alarming, but the weight loss, tenderness in your abdomen and elevated blood pressure are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay… so, something is wrong? Not like my sister, I hope? What kind of… investigation? Do I need… a lot of tests? I don’t like tests.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something as serious as your sister’s illness, and we’re being proactive, which is good. The tests will help us understand what’s going on, and we’ll only do what’s necessary. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, liver and kidney function, and electrolytes. I also want to order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or bleeding. And finally, I recommend a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a more detailed look at your organs and rule out any potential problems. I know it sounds like a lot, but it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan? That sounds… serious. And blood work… lots of needles? I don’t do well with needles. But… if it will help… if it will make sure I’m not like my sister… then okay. Yes. Do what you need to do. But… can you explain what you’re looking for? What could be wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. It is a lot, and it’s okay to be anxious. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your organs, and the blood work will give us information about how your body is functioning. Given your symptoms – fatigue, stomach upset, weight loss, and tenderness in your abdomen – we need to rule out several possibilities. These tests will help us determine if you have an infection, inflammation, a blockage in your digestive system, or, less likely, something more serious like cancer. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we won't know for sure until we get the results. The stool test is relatively simple – you’ll just need to collect a sample. The blood work will involve a few needles, but we'll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. And the CT scan is non-invasive, though you’ll need to lie still for a short period of time. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Cancer… you said… less likely? That’s good, right? But… if it is cancer… what happens then? My sister… it’s been hard on her. And… I don’t want to be a burden. I'm old. I think… I understand the tests. Just… the thought of them… And what if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to be worried about those possibilities, Mr. Schwer. And you're right, it's good to remember that cancer is less likely, but we need to rule it out to be sure. If the tests do reveal cancer, there are many treatment options available, depending on the type and stage of the cancer. These options could include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. The goal of treatment would be to remove the cancer or control its growth and improve your quality of life. And you are absolutely not a burden. As your doctor, it's my job to provide you with the best possible care, regardless of your age or health status. We’ll go through everything together, step by step, and make sure you have all the support you need. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. We’ll schedule them for as soon as possible. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can develop a plan of action. And remember, we're being proactive, which is good. It’s much better to know what’s going on so we can address it if needed. Would you like me to go over the instructions for the tests again?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. The instructions. I always forget things. And… thank you, Doctor. For not making me feel… stupid. My sister… she gets angry when I ask questions. So, tell me again. What do I have to do? With the… stool test… and the blood work… and the… CT scan.
DOCTOR: You're not stupid at all, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly normal to have questions, and I'm happy to answer them. And I'm glad I can provide you with some reassurance. Let's go over the instructions. First, the stool test. You'll receive a collection kit from the lab. It comes with a container and some instructions. You'll need to collect a small sample of your stool in the container, following the instructions carefully. Then, you'll seal the container and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. They’ll give you specific instructions about how to store it if you can't bring it in right away. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the appointment. That means no food or drinks, except for water. You’ll go to the lab, and a phlebotomist will draw a few tubes of blood. It’s a quick procedure, but you may feel a slight pinch. And finally, the CT scan. You'll need to arrive about 30 minutes before your appointment time. You'll be asked to change into a hospital gown. The technician will then position you on a table, and the scan will take about 10-20 minutes. It's painless, but you’ll need to lie still during the scan. They may give you a contrast dye, which helps to improve the images. If you have any allergies, be sure to let the technician know. Do you have any questions about any of these instructions?
PATIENT: No… I think… I think I understand. Stool test, no food for blood work, lie still for scan. And tell them about allergies. Okay. That doesn't sound… too bad. When will I get the results? That’s what I really want to know. How long will I have to wait? My sister… she had to wait a long time. It was… horrible.
DOCTOR: That's right. You've got it. The results usually take a few days to come back. I'll call you as soon as I have them, so you don’t have to worry about waiting on hold or anything like that. The lab will usually have the stool test results back the quickest – within 2-3 business days. The blood work will take a little longer, around 3-5 business days. And the CT scan results may take up to a week, depending on how busy the radiologist is. I understand your anxiety about the wait, and I'll do everything I can to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. We won’t leave you in the dark. And I will explain everything to you in detail when I call, so you have a clear understanding of what's going on. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call my office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think… that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient. And… you didn’t make me feel… silly. I’ll try not to worry too much. But it’s hard. My sister… Okay. I’ll do the tests. And I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. And you didn't ask silly questions at all. I'm glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get through this together. It was nice meeting you. .
