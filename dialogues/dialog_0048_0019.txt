DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Carlotta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Manuel Carlotta. It’s… good to meet you, Doctor… Sink, yes? I think my wife, Aisha, made the appointment. She does a lot of the remembering for me these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sink. And… Aisha, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Aisha. My wife. A good woman. We… we been married a long time. She wanted to come with me today, but she has… things to do. Something with the market, I think. She helps sell things there. We are… hoping to have a baby. Or… maybe think about it. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's focus on why you're here today, Mr. Carlotta. Aisha's market ventures are… not particularly relevant. What brought you in?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. I get… lost sometimes. She just… worries. We are older, you see. And it’s… hard, maybe? To have babies when you are… not young. We want to make sure everything is okay, if we try. That's why we came. I don’t… I don’t know what they check for, exactly. Just… make sure. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: "Make sure." Yes, well, that's… vague. Are you experiencing any difficulties?
PATIENT: Difficulties…? Not that I know of. Everything… works, if you understand. But… maybe not as strong as before? I don’t know. It’s been a long time since we… tried. Aisha thinks maybe we need… help? I don’t understand all the things doctors do. She said something about… tests? To see if everything is still… good? I am sorry, I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Right. "Everything still good." We'll need to get some specifics, Mr. Carlotta. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm. Let me think. I had… a bad cough, a long time ago. When we first came to this country. They gave me some medicine for that. And my back… it gets sore sometimes, from bending over the metal. I make little models, you see. Cars and… things. Aisha sells them. Other than that… I don't think so. I've never been to the hospital, not really. Just… the cough. Is that important?
DOCTOR: The cough… potentially. And the back soreness – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. When I work too long, bending over the little pieces. Aisha tells me to sit up straight, but it's hard! The models are small. It aches then, mostly. Not all the time. It's just… old age, I think. Everything aches a little when you get older, yes? I don’t take anything for it. Just… try to rest. And Aisha rubs it sometimes. She’s very good at that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Never had a surgery. Not that I remember. Aisha would have told me, if I had. She remembers everything. No… no surgeries. Just… the cough. I am sure of it. She would have been very worried if I had a surgery.
DOCTOR: Family history, then. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh. Family… Hmm. That’s… hard to remember. We didn’t see them much. We came from Somalia a long time ago. My mother… I think she had a bad heart, maybe? She wasn’t well. She passed away, a long time ago. I had a brother, but I haven’t seen him since we left. Aisha says it’s best not to dwell on the past, but I do miss them sometimes. She’s right, though. It’s best to focus on now. Is that what you want to know? About them? It's all very… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. Aisha gives me medicine sometimes, for a cold, but I haven’t ever had a bad reaction. I eat all sorts of things. She cooks very good food, lots of spices. No… I don’t think I have allergies. Maybe a little dust, sometimes, when I’m working with the metal, but that’s just a sneeze. Nothing serious. She always makes sure the workshop is clean.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes, if my back is sore, Aisha gives me… a cream, I think? To rub on it. But it's not every day. And it’s… just a cream. She buys it at the shop. Nothing you need to write down, I think. I don’t take pills or anything. Just the cream, when I need it. She worries about me taking too many things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, perhaps we should do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Do you mind if I listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Aisha always says it’s good to check things. But I feel fine, mostly. Just… old. I'll do whatever you need, Doctor. Just… be gentle, yes? My back gets sore easily. And I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the table. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your blood pressure is a little high, but nothing alarming. The murmur is likely benign.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad? High blood pressure? I don’t understand all these words. Aisha always says I eat too much salt, maybe that's it? She makes very good food, but… lots of flavor. The murmur… is that serious? Is it something I should worry about? I feel fine, you know. Just… old. She’s always telling me to take it easy.
DOCTOR: It's not immediately concerning, Mr. Carlotta. We'll monitor it. A murmur can be common with age. Now, given your age and desire to potentially start a family… we should run some basic blood work to assess your overall health and hormone levels. I'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a testosterone level. We'll also need a urine sample. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will guide you.
PATIENT: Oh. Lots of tests. Aisha said there would be tests. Hormone levels… is that about… being able to have a baby? Is something wrong? I feel a little nervous now. All these tests… it sounds serious. Is it going to be expensive? We don’t have much money, you see. And a urine sample… that’s alright, I suppose. But all this… it’s a lot to take in. Is the nurse nice? She sounds very busy.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Carlotta. Not necessarily an indication of anything being wrong. Just gathering information. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion. We can discuss that with the billing department later. The nurse is competent. Just follow her instructions. I need to see other patients now. After the lab work, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Lots of tests, then a follow-up. Aisha will be glad I came. She worries about everything. I'll go to the lab… and find the nice nurse. And we’ll talk about the money later. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn’t take too long. And… is it alright if I ask Aisha to come with me to the next appointment? She remembers things better than me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, bring your wife. That would likely be… helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
PATIENT: .
