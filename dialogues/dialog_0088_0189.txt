DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about time someone got around to seeing me. It’s my… well, let’s just say when I go to the bathroom, there’s red in the bowl. Not a good sign, is it? I haven’t had this trouble since… well, a long time ago, and I’d rather not dwell on that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Red in the bowl is certainly something we need to investigate. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate? What’s to investigate? It’s blood, plain and simple. And I’m telling you, I haven’t been eating beets or anything like that. It’s not like I’m a child. How often do you have to ask me to repeat myself? Is this a new doctor thing?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem repetitive, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s just important to gather all the information to ensure I understand the situation completely. And you’re right, it is blood, and we need to figure out where it’s coming from. Could you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… red. Like blood. What do you want me to do, analyze the viscosity? I'm not a scientist, you know. It’s not bright red, if that’s what you’re getting at. It's… darker. A bit… murky, maybe? Honestly, it looks unpleasant. Is that good enough for you?
DOCTOR: Okay, darker and a bit murky. That’s helpful. And is it mixed in with your stool, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Separate, mostly. Though sometimes… sometimes it’s on it, if you catch my drift. Not all the time, mind you. Just… sometimes. Honestly, it’s a bit of a mess, and I’d rather not talk about it in such detail. I've seen enough of it, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand, it's not a pleasant topic. Thank you for sharing that with me. Has this been happening consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It started… oh, a week or so ago, I reckon. Not every day, thankfully. A few days fine, then… there it is again. And it's not getting better, if that's what you're asking. I'm 88 years old, you know. Things aren't supposed to start happening now, are they?
DOCTOR: No, things certainly aren't supposed to start happening now. Alright, a week or so, coming and going. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with bowel movements, or any changes in your usual bowel habits – like diarrhea, constipation, or feeling like you need to go more frequently?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. More of a… strain, I suppose. Takes a bit more effort, if you know what I mean. And as for the other things… well, I’ve always had a delicate constitution. Let’s just say regularity isn't my strong suit. It's never been predictable, even when I was a young man flying those planes.
DOCTOR: Alright, some strain with bowel movements, and a history of irregularity. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, doctors have poked and prodded at me for years. High blood pressure, they said, once. Something about my cholesterol, too. But I never paid much attention to it. I was a pilot, you know. We didn’t have time for all that fuss. Perfectly healthy as far as I’m concerned. And frankly, I don't remember everything they told me. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and cholesterol in the past. I understand remembering details from a long time ago can be difficult. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. There was something… a hernia, I believe. Years and years ago, when I was still flying. And… something with my appendix, maybe? Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. They knocked me out, you know. Can’t be expected to remember everything when they’re pumping you full of… whatever it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hernia repair and possibly an appendectomy in the past. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Hardly. I don’t believe in all those pills. They just want to keep you hooked, you know? I take a little something for my arthritis now and then, when it flares up. But that's it. I prefer to rely on good old-fashioned common sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, just something for arthritis as needed. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Don't be ridiculous. I've eaten everything under the sun, traveled everywhere. I'm a hardy Haida man, I tell you. I haven't got time for allergies. Maybe a bit of a sniffle now and then, but nothing serious. Definitely not allergic to anything important.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and a quick rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. It will help me get a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A… a what now? You want to… examine me? At my age? Really? I came here because of the blood, not to be poked and prodded like some… some common patient. I think I’ve answered enough questions for one day. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uneasy. The rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating blood in the stool, especially at your age. It's the best way to help determine the source of the bleeding and ensure there's nothing serious going on. However, I completely respect your wishes. We can proceed without it, but it will make it more difficult to get a clear diagnosis. If we don’t do the exam, we would need to order some stool tests and possibly a colonoscopy with a specialist to rule out anything serious. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Good heavens. That sounds… unpleasant. And tests? More poking and prodding, I presume? I suppose… if it’s the only way. But I want it done quickly. And I want a young, competent doctor. Not some… trainee. And no funny business, understand? Just get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. We will get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I will personally oversee all testing and ensure you are comfortable throughout the process. I can arrange for a stool test today, and I’ll write a referral for a colonoscopy with Dr. Emily Carter - she’s one of the best gastroenterologists in the area and very experienced. Now, let me get that referral written up for you. In the meantime, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly. What does that even matter at this point? Well, my father… he was a fisherman, a good Haida man. Lived a long life, though. Died in his sleep, they said. My mother… she was a weaver, very skilled. Died young, unfortunately. I don't recall anyone having… problems like this. Though people didn’t talk about such things back then. It wasn’t considered… polite.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known family history of similar issues. And, just to clarify, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms, such as abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, or nausea?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Just… tired, I suppose. Being 88 years old is exhausting, you know? But that's just… age. I don’t need a doctor to tell me that. I'm not losing weight, and I eat like a horse. As for the other things... no. Just the blood. That’s all. And frankly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish sitting here answering all these questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom. It's good to hear you aren't experiencing any other symptoms. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. My father warned me about it when I was a boy, said it was a fool's errand. As for alcohol... I used to have a wee dram now and then, back in my flying days. A small one, to celebrate a good flight. But I haven't had a drink in years. Not interested in that sort of thing anymore. It doesn’t agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol in the past. And finally, do you have any concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Just... when am I going to get this colonoscopy done? And will it be terribly painful? I've heard stories... horrible stories. And will this Dr. Carter be competent? I don't want some young trainee poking around where they shouldn't be. That's all I want to know. Just get it over with, quickly and efficiently, and make sure it doesn’t hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Rowbottom. I will ensure Dr. Carter is aware of your anxiety, and you will be fully informed of the procedure beforehand. She’s a very skilled and experienced gastroenterologist, and you’ll be in good hands. We can discuss pain management options if you’re concerned. I'm writing the referral now. It will take a few days to get an appointment scheduled. I’ll have my nurse call you once it’s confirmed. In the meantime, I’ll order the stool test today to start gathering some information. Here’s the form for the stool test. Please take this to the lab as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… get it done quickly. And don't let that Dr. Carter make a mess of things. I've had enough trouble for one day. I suppose I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. We'll do our best to make this as smooth as possible. My nurse will be in touch soon. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and please get some rest.
PATIENT: .
