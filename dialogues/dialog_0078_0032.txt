DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A… a rather delicate matter, I’m afraid. It’s… well, it’s something a man doesn’t often discuss. It’s been… discharging. Yes, discharging. From… there. It’s most unpleasant, you understand. I haven't the foggiest idea why it would be happening at my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to discuss these things, but you’ve come to the right place, Mr. Krok. We'll get to the bottom of it. When you say “discharging,” could you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. Well, it’s… not a flood, thankfully. More of a… a dampness, really. A sort of… slickness. And sometimes… a bit yellowish. I do try to keep things… tidy, you understand. But it’s there, nonetheless. It’s been going on for… oh, a week or so, I suppose. Maybe a bit longer. Time does rather slip away these days. Is that helpful? I don’t really know what details are helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. “Dampness” and “slickness” with some yellowish discoloration, for about a week or so. Okay. And has this been associated with any pain, burning, itching, or fever?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. A bit of… discomfort, perhaps. A slight stinging now and again. And no, I haven’t felt feverish. My wife, bless her heart, checks my temperature regularly. She's very diligent, that one. No fever, no itching… just this… issue. It’s quite embarrassing, you know. A respectable man like myself… to be bothered with this. It simply isn’t dignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly natural to feel embarrassed, but these things happen, and we’ll approach it with the utmost discretion and respect. No fever is good. And you mentioned slight stinging… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, yes. Definitely comes and goes. Mostly when… well, when I relieve myself. And sometimes… just randomly, a little twinge. It’s not debilitating, not at all. More of an annoyance, really. I've been trying to keep the area… clean, as one should. Soap and water, mostly. Though I confess, I haven’t been entirely sure how clean is clean enough, if you follow. Old habits, you see. One doesn’t always know what’s… appropriate anymore. I hope that clarifies things. Is there something I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, intermittent stinging, particularly with urination, and you've been maintaining hygiene with soap and water. Good. Now, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, difficulty urinating, or increased frequency?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Questions, questions. Well, let me see… the colour seems normal enough. I haven’t noticed anything… amiss there. The odour… I suppose it’s the usual. A man doesn’t spend much time analyzing his urine, you understand. And no, no difficulty urinating. Everything flows as it should, thank goodness. And as for increased frequency… perhaps a little. But I’ve always had a… sensitive bladder, shall we say? My wife would tell you I’m constantly heading to the lavatory. It’s just part of getting older, I presume. Is this… necessary? I feel as though I’m being interrogated!
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Mr. Krok. I just want to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. You're right to point out the increased frequency – that’s good to know, even if it’s something you’ve experienced for a while. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, surgeries, or changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… hmm. I had a bit of a cold last winter, nothing serious. A cough, a sniffle, the usual. Surgeries… let me think. A hernia repair, oh, goodness, thirty years ago, maybe more. It healed nicely. And medications… just a small dose of something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My doctor prescribed it. Can’t recall the name, unfortunately. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I’m probably rambling. I apologize. This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Krok. This is all very helpful information. So, cold last winter, hernia repair many years ago, and medication for blood pressure – we can look that up in your records. Now, one last few questions before I do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. My wife gives me a bit of a hard time about eating shellfish sometimes, says it gives me indigestion, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… unpleasantness. I’ve never had a proper allergic reaction, no hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Nothing like that. A bit sensitive to the sun, perhaps. But that’s hardly a medical concern, is it? I’m quite a robust fellow, generally. Though, admittedly, a bit under the weather at the moment. Do I have to be examined? It’s awfully… personal.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok. A physical exam is the best way to help determine the cause of your symptoms, and it will allow me to make the best recommendations for your care. It will be a quick and discreet exam, focused on the relevant areas. We can keep you covered and comfortable throughout the process. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Alright. If you insist. It’s just… a man’s dignity, you understand. But if it’s necessary… then I suppose I must. Discreet, you say? And I can stop you at any time? Very well. Explain everything as you go, and… please be gentle. And try to be quick about it. This is all rather… mortifying. Lead the way, Doctor. I'll try not to squirm.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. I appreciate your trust. We'll take things slowly and with the utmost respect for your comfort. The exam will involve a quick visual inspection and a gentle touch to assess the area. I will explain each step before I perform it. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. If you could lie down on the table, we'll get started. We’ll begin with a simple visual inspection, and then I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. After that, I'll need to gently examine your prostate gland through a digital rectal exam. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it's a necessary step to get a clear understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Goodness gracious. Is that absolutely necessary? I thought Doctors were supposed to be… less invasive these days. But if you say so… alright. Alright. As long as you’re gentle. And explain everything, as you promised. I’d prefer not to be surprised. And please, hurry. The sooner this is over, the better. Proceed, Doctor. But be warned, I'm not a fan of surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand your apprehension. A digital rectal exam is often necessary to evaluate the prostate gland, which can provide important information about the cause of your symptoms. I will explain each step as I go and stop if you feel any discomfort. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me assess your overall health and identify any potential issues. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to ask you to bend your knees and take a few deep breaths. I'm going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. Hmm… the prostate gland feels slightly enlarged and somewhat tender. There are no obvious nodules or masses. Okay, that’s all done. It wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not… not terrible, I suppose. Though I’d hardly call it pleasant. It’s just… undignified, Doctor. Simply undignified. Enlarged and tender, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? Am I… am I ill? I’ve lived a long life, you see. I’ve always taken care of myself. This is… unsettling. What are my options? Please, don't tell me I need some sort of… procedure. I’m too old for procedures. Just tell me what this means, and what, if anything, needs to be done. And please, no more poking.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok, and I apologize again for any discomfort you experienced. An enlarged and tender prostate gland is a common finding in men your age, and it often indicates a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This means your prostate gland has simply grown larger, which can cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, and a weak urine stream. It’s not cancer, and it’s not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome and affect your quality of life. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. A urine analysis will check for infection or other abnormalities. A prostate-specific antigen test will measure the level of PSA in your blood, which can help rule out cancer. And I’d also like to perform a postvoid residual test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Based on the results of these tests, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or, in some cases, minimally invasive procedures. We will take things slowly and make a decision together, based on your individual needs and preferences. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. It never ends, does it? Very well, Doctor. Tests it is. Though I must confess, I'm growing rather weary of medical examinations. But if it will give me peace of mind… then I suppose I have no choice. Lifestyle changes… what sort of lifestyle changes? Less tea? More exercise? I’m hardly a young man anymore, Doctor. And about the… procedure? You mentioned a procedure. Is it painful? Will it require a hospital stay? I’ve always preferred to avoid hospitals, if at all possible. Just tell me what I’m getting myself into, Doctor. Be honest with me. And please, no more poking. I've had quite enough poking for one day. Let’s just get these tests done, and see what they say. Then we can… proceed with caution.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Krok. I promise to be as honest and upfront with you as possible. The lifestyle changes I’m referring to are relatively simple: reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, staying hydrated, and practicing regular bladder training. These can often help alleviate symptoms. Regarding the procedure, it's a minimally invasive option that we would only consider if lifestyle changes and medications aren't effective. It involves removing some of the excess prostate tissue to relieve pressure on the urethra. It's typically performed on an outpatient basis, meaning you wouldn't require a hospital stay. It can cause some temporary discomfort, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We would discuss all the risks and benefits in detail before proceeding, and we would only do it if it was absolutely necessary. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll write you a referral for the lab, and they'll schedule an appointment for you. The urine analysis and PSA test are simple blood and urine samples. The postvoid residual test involves urinating into a special container, and then we'll measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder with a handheld device. I’ll also have my nurse give you a handout with more information about BPH and the tests we’re ordering. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A handout… that's good. I do appreciate a good handout. Information is always helpful. No, I don't think I have any further questions at this moment, Doctor. Just… please let me know the results as soon as they're available. I’m not one for waiting around, you see. I prefer to know what I’m dealing with. Thank you, Doctor Solero. For your patience, and for explaining everything so clearly. It’s not easy, discussing these things. And I do appreciate you… not poking me any further. I'll go and get these tests done, and then we’ll see what happens. I suppose one must simply… endure. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, tell your nurse to be gentle with the tests. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. It was my pleasure. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we’ll take things slowly and with the utmost care. And I’ll make a note for the nurse to be gentle. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, chills, or inability to urinate, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here are the referral form and the handout. Please take your time and let me know if you have any questions. Take care, Mr. Krok. And please don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
