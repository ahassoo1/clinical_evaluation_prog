DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Alanes, nice to meet you too! Well, I’ve been having these chills, like, not a fever chill, just…cold. It’s been going on for a couple of days now. It’s kind of annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chills can certainly be bothersome. And you mentioned it’s been happening for a couple of days. Could you describe a bit more about when these chills occur?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be at a certain time. Sometimes I feel them in the morning, sometimes at night, and even once in the afternoon while I was just watching TV. There doesn’t really seem to be a pattern, which is weird. It just…happens.
DOCTOR: That is a bit unusual if there isn’t a clear pattern. Are you experiencing anything else alongside these chills—any body aches, fatigue, cough, sore throat, or any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No cough or sore throat, thankfully. I have been a little more tired than usual, I guess. Just kinda…blah. And maybe a tiny bit achy, but nothing major. Like, not enough to take anything for, you know? It's hard to explain. It's just a general feeling of being…off.
DOCTOR: I see. A general feeling of being “off” and some mild fatigue and aches. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing major. I had the flu a couple of years ago, and a bad case of strep throat when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well and I walk most days. Nothing chronic, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and I've never been in the hospital. Just the usual check-ups and things like that. I broke my arm when I was little, but that was just a cast and a lot of ice, nothing serious. I’m really not a hospital person!
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No significant surgical history or hospitalizations. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think… My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some problems with his cholesterol when he got older. My grandma, on my mom’s side, had diabetes, but that's really the biggest thing I can think of. Nothing too serious, thankfully. We're a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. Nothing else. I try to get most of what I need from my food, but I take one just in case. And sometimes I'll take Vitamin C when I feel like I’m coming down with something, but that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional Vitamin C. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of! I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky that way. I can eat shellfish, nuts, everything. It’s kinda nice not having to worry about that stuff.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a Health Education Specialist, so I’m on my feet a bit, talking to people a lot. I live alone, since my divorce a couple of years ago. I try to cook healthy meals most nights, but sometimes I’ll order takeout if I'm really tired. I walk my dog, Leo, every day – he’s a rescue, a little terrier mix. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, like maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Pretty normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. And just to confirm, you've been experiencing these chills for two days, accompanied by mild fatigue and aches, with no fever, cough, or sore throat. No significant medical history, allergies, or medications. You're divorced, live alone, and work as a Health Education Specialist. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Definitely. I'm happy to get checked out. Hopefully, it's nothing serious! Just a little bug or something, maybe? I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Okay, your temperature is normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. I'm going to look at your ears now. Everything looks good in your ears. Now, let me take a look at your throat. Your throat looks clear as well. I don't see any signs of infection at this time. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes feel normal. It doesn’t appear to be anything obvious at this point. Do you mind if I briefly examine your abdomen?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. That’s reassuring that everything looks normal so far! Yeah, sure, go ahead and check my abdomen, if you think it’s helpful. I’m trusting your expertise here, Dr. Alanes! I'm happy to help in any way I can to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Based on the physical exam, everything appears normal. However, the chills, fatigue, and aches are concerning. While it may be a mild viral illness, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work, specifically a Complete Blood Count and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , to get a better understanding of what might be going on. These tests can help us check for signs of infection, inflammation, or any underlying metabolic issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Blood work seems like a good idea if you think it’ll help figure things out. I'd rather be sure than just ignore it, you know? A CBC and CMP... I think I remember hearing about those. So, it’s just a standard blood draw then? And how long does it usually take to get the results back? Is it something I can do here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a standard blood draw. We can do it right here at the clinic, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating nutritious foods. If your symptoms worsen—such as developing a fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing—please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. That all sounds very reasonable. Rest, hydration, good food… I can manage that! And I’ll definitely keep an eye on things and call if anything gets worse. 24-48 hours... I can definitely wait that long. Okay, let’s do the blood draw then. Just let me know when you’re ready and I’ll roll up my sleeve. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me today, Dr. Alanes. It’s a relief to have someone check things out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very skilled and will make you comfortable. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here is a copy of the lab requisition form, and a sheet detailing post-blood draw instructions. Do you have any questions for me before Sarah comes in?
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thank you for the papers. I think that's all my questions for now, actually. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you being so thorough and patient with me. And I really appreciate Sarah being skilled - I'm not a huge fan of needles! I think I'm all set. I'll just sit here and try to relax until she comes. Thanks again, Dr. Alanes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I understand your apprehension about needles, and Sarah will do her best to make the process as comfortable as possible. Please just let her know if you're feeling anxious, and she will take her time. I’ll leave you to relax now, and I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
