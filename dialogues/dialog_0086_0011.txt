DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Doctor… Mmm, Mrtic, is it? I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ I wanna get done. A… a fixin’. To my face. It's important. And I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s right. It’s… somethin’ to make me look… presentable. I don’t wanna go into detail. Just need you to say it’s okay. Folks are tellin’ me I look… tired. And I ain’t got time for that. Is that somethin’ you do here? Approve… face work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, this is a medical clinic. I’m a physician. I don’t simply… “approve face work.” Could you be a little more specific about what you're hoping to have done?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness. Look, it’s… wrinkles. And sags. It’s… a lift, I think. Some people get ‘em. Makes you look younger. I don’t know what kinda lift. Some fella told me about it. Said I needed a doctor to say I'm healthy enough. That’s all. I ain't askin’ for your opinion on whether I need it. Just… can you check if I'm… sturdy enough for it? I work with towers, you know. Gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. So you want me to assess your overall health to determine if you’re a suitable candidate for a cosmetic procedure – a facelift, as you’ve described it. While I don’t routinely perform cosmetic procedures here, I can certainly evaluate you. First, let’s go through some medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… let me think. I had somethin’ done with my… appendix, I believe. A long time ago. When I was a young man. And… I broke my arm once. Fell off a ladder, workin’ on a tower. They… fixed it. That’s it, I think. Maybe somethin’ with my teeth? I don't really keep track of these things. It was a while back. Does it matter? I'm feelin’ alright now.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Honcoop. Even seemingly minor procedures can have complications, and knowing your surgical history is important. We need to be thorough. Alright, appendix removal and a broken arm that was repaired. Anything with your teeth, you said?
PATIENT: Just fillings, I reckon. A few. Old age stuff. And I had a wisdom tooth pulled, maybe? It was a long time ago. A dentist did it. I don’t remember much, honestly. Look, is this gonna take long? I got a job to do. Towers don’t fix themselves, you know. And I'm payin’ for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, fillings and a wisdom tooth extraction. Noted. Now, do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doc mentioned somethin' about that a while back. Said I needed to watch my salt. I try to, mostly. And… I get a little short of breath sometimes. Climbin’ those towers, it’s hard work. But I'm strong. Always have been. Other than that… no. I'm a hardy fella. Never been sick much. Just… tired. That’s all. Is that good enough? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, “good enough” isn’t acceptable when it comes to your health. You mentioned high blood pressure and shortness of breath – those are significant. Do you take any medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication? Hmm… I might have some pills. In a jar somewhere. My sister gave ‘em to me. Said they were for my… pressure. But I don’t really like takin’ pills. Makes me feel… sluggish. I mostly just try to get enough sleep. And drink water. Is that alright? Can we skip the pills part? I’m tellin’ you, I feel fine. Mostly. Just a little… worn down.
DOCTOR: You are taking medication for high blood pressure, intermittently, and you are not consistently adhering to the prescribed regimen. This is extremely concerning, especially given your work. We need to know exactly what you're taking, and the dosage. Do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Bottle? No. Like I said, it's in a jar… somewhere. At my place. It's a little white bottle, I think. With a blue label. My sister gets me stuff. She’s… health-conscious. Look, I don’t understand why this is so important! I just want you to tell me if I can get this face thing done. Can’t you just look at me and tell me? I'm a strong man. I climb towers every day. Surely that counts for somethin’. This is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but this isn't a waste of time. It's a matter of patient safety. Elective procedures, like a facelift, carry risks, and those risks are significantly increased if you have underlying health conditions that aren't properly managed. I cannot and will not clear you for a procedure without a complete understanding of your medical history and current health status. We need to reschedule this appointment. Please bring all of your medications, including the bottle your sister gave you, and a list of any allergies you have. We will also need to check your blood pressure and potentially run some blood tests. If you are unwilling to do that, I will not be able to assist you. Do you understand?
