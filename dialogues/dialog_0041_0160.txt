DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I haven't got all day. It's this tiredness. Just…exhausted. And I’ve been…eating dirt. Don’t look at me like that, it's just…happening. It’s not like I want to, you know? It's just…a craving.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness and…a craving for dirt. Right. Hmm. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. When did you first start noticing the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ages ago. Months, I suppose. It comes and goes. It’s just…worse lately. I used to be able to get things done. Now I nap all the time. And the…stuff…started around the same time, I think. It’s hard to remember exactly. Honestly, doctors these days, always asking about when things started. It all feels like one long blur.
DOCTOR: You're right, it can be hard to pinpoint things. Don’t worry about being precise. Just roughly, months. And it sounds like both the tiredness and the…dirt-eating…started around the same time. Is it a constant craving, or does it come and go like the tiredness?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I'm stressed, I guess. Though what isn’t stressful these days? And it's not like I'm eating handfuls of it, you know? Just…a little. From the garden, mostly. It’s not like I’m going out and buying dirt. That would be ridiculous. Honestly, the questions…it's just embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not easy to talk about, Candis. You're doing great. So, stress seems to be a trigger, and it’s a small amount from the garden. Okay. Now, apart from the tiredness and this craving, have you noticed anything else different lately?
PATIENT: Different? What do you mean? I'm 79 years old! Everything is different! My knees ache, my back hurts…is that what you want to know? I forget things sometimes, though I do remember when things started, thank you very much. It’s just…general old age, I suppose. What else would it be? I don’t have any fancy illnesses.
DOCTOR: You're right to point all that out. It's good to get a complete picture. And I appreciate you telling me. Let's just quickly go through some of the typical things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, other than the…dirt-eating?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I'm hungry, I don’t eat when I'm not. Small portions, mostly. I’m not a big eater these days. Everything tastes…bland. Honestly, the food these days. It's all processed rubbish. I used to cook proper meals, but what's the point, just for one person? Now, are we done yet? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Okay, a reduced appetite and food tasting bland. That's helpful. Now, just one more quick thing, and then we'll do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Of course I have! I’m wasting away! I used to weigh…well, never you mind how much I used to weigh. But yes, I've lost weight. I'm just a little frame now. I used to be…sturdier. Honestly, this is all very obvious. Are we still asking questions? I could have told you all this when you walked in the door.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Candis. It is obvious, and I apologize for making you repeat yourself. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible. Now, if you’re agreeable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't poke around too much. I don't like being touched. Honestly, doctors these days…all they want to do is poke and prod. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me…and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. And your lungs sound clear, but a bit diminished. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little low, 100/60. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything is tender. Abdomen is soft, but I do feel some slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing concerning, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Okay, that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: See? I told you it was tender. It’s my stomach. It always bothers me. Probably just indigestion. Honestly, you're making a big deal out of nothing. Can we please be done now? I really need to go. I have things to do. And I'm getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. I understand. We'll note the tenderness in your upper right quadrant. Now, given your tiredness, the craving for dirt – which we call geophagia – weight loss, and the tenderness in your abdomen, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to a nutritional deficiency, like iron or zinc. The geophagia itself can sometimes indicate that your body is lacking something. However, given your age and weight loss, it's also important to rule out other causes. I would like to order some blood tests to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, kidney function, iron levels, and vitamin levels. I also think a stool sample would be helpful to rule out any infections. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Stool samples? Are you serious? This is ridiculous! I don’t need any tests. I just need to rest and eat something decent. I’m an old woman, not a science experiment! Honestly, doctors these days, always wanting to run tests for everything. I bet it’s nothing. Just…old age. Can’t I just go home? I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself. I’ve lived a long life without all these fancy tests! .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Candis. And I respect your decision. While I strongly recommend the tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I won’t force you to have them. However, if you do decide to proceed with the tests, it would help us to rule out any serious underlying conditions. If you’re not comfortable with the tests today, perhaps we can revisit the idea later. In the meantime, I would recommend focusing on a balanced diet and ensuring you get enough rest. I’m going to write you a note outlining my concerns and the potential benefits of the tests. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Would you like me to write that note now?
