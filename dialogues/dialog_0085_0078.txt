DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping you can help me feel… better. I feel a bit run down, like I need a reset, a jumpstart, if you understand. It’s hard to explain exactly. I just don't have the energy I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s very common to feel that way, especially with everything going on. “Run down” is a good way to describe it. It sounds like we need to explore what might be causing that lack of energy. Let's start with the present. Can you tell me more about when you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It didn't happen overnight, you know? Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe a little longer? It was gradual. At first, I just thought it was the change of seasons, honestly. But it hasn’t really gone away. It’s just… persisted. I do quite a bit of physical work, shaping things with my hands, and I thought I was just tired from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months is helpful to know. And you mentioned physical work. Could you tell me a little more about what that involves?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m a… well, it’s hard to explain the exact title in English. We’re Molders, Shapers, and Casters, except with materials other than metal and plastic. Think… clay, wax, sometimes even stone. I create pieces for… decorations, mostly. It requires a lot of standing, and a lot of precise hand movements. And lifting, sometimes, depending on the size of the piece. It's fulfilling work, but it can be quite demanding on the body.
DOCTOR: That sounds physically demanding indeed. Thank you for explaining. So, it’s been six months of feeling run down, while consistently doing this type of physical work. Have you noticed this fatigue affecting any other parts of your life?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. I find it harder to… keep up with things at home. Small tasks seem… overwhelming. And I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had the energy for it this year. My husband has been very understanding, but I hate feeling like a burden. And… honestly, I haven't been sleeping very well either. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue impacting daily tasks, gardening, and difficulty sleeping. Let’s talk a little more about the sleep. How many hours of sleep are you typically getting each night?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… variable, unfortunately. Some nights I get maybe six hours, if I’m lucky. Other nights, it’s more like four or five. And even when I do get six hours, it’s not restful sleep. I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes it’s just… nothing, I just wake up. Other times it’s a little achy, mostly in my back and shoulders.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to four hours, restless sleep, waking up several times, and some associated aches and pains in your back and shoulders. Have you tried anything to improve your sleep?
PATIENT: Yes, a few things. My husband suggested warm milk before bed, but that didn’t seem to help. And I’ve tried to establish a regular bedtime, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, but it’s difficult with… well, with life, you know? Sometimes orders come in late, and I have to work to finish them. Also, I've tried one of those herbal teas, chamomile, I think, but it didn't really make a difference either. I haven’t really found anything that works consistently.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Let's move on to some other things. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My appetite has been… diminished, I suppose. I don’t feel as hungry as I used to. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds, although I haven’t weighed myself recently. It's not intentional, definitely. I just… don’t feel like eating. My husband makes wonderful meals, but sometimes I just pick at them.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. Now, thinking a little more broadly, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue, sleep issues, and decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, I feel a little… dizzy. Not often, but enough to notice. And I’ve been more irritable than usual, I think. My husband certainly points it out! Also, I have been feeling a bit cold lately, even when it’s warm. I know that sounds strange. Just a general feeling of being chilled, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, increased irritability, and feeling cold. I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me, Ms. Pitzel. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I'm covered by Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly. I don't have any major conditions, thankfully. My blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but it’s usually controlled with diet and exercise. And I had a surgery on my knee many years ago, but it doesn’t bother me much anymore. Aside from that, I’ve been generally healthy. Or, I was generally healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure, controlled with diet and exercise, and a previous knee surgery. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a little complicated. My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems. Both of them passed away quite a while ago, unfortunately. And my siblings are generally healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other very often, so I don’t always have the latest information. But, to my knowledge, there isn’t a strong history of… anything major on either side. It's hard to say definitively, though. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical details.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with diabetes, father with heart problems, otherwise relatively unremarkable family history. Now, let’s talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any known allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. And as for medications… I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, as I mentioned earlier, but that’s it. No other prescriptions, and I rarely take over-the-counter medications. I prefer to avoid them if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, and lisinopril for blood pressure. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly discuss social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I’ve never been much of a drinker. My husband enjoys a beer sometimes, but I prefer a glass of water. I think it’s important to stay hydrated, especially with the physical work I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. Thank you, Ms. Pitzel, for providing all of this information. It gives me a much clearer picture of what's going on. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed whenever you are ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. That blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air movement bilaterally. Thyroid is normal to palpation, no enlargement or nodules. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, neurological function appears intact. Skin is warm and dry, no rashes or lesions. Ears, nose, and throat appear normal. Everything appears generally normal on initial examination, but given your symptoms – fatigue, weight loss, dizziness, and feeling cold – and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds like a very sensible plan, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good next step to understand what's going on. Please, order whatever tests you deem necessary. I’ll happily comply. Thank you for being so thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test, a Vitamin D level, and a Ferritin level. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential deficiencies or imbalances. The lab should be able to draw the blood today. They’ll give you instructions on fasting if needed. While we're waiting for the results, I want to also discuss some lifestyle modifications that may help. Getting adequate sleep is crucial, even if it means adjusting your work schedule if possible. And ensuring you're getting a balanced diet is important. Do you have any trouble eating regular meals?
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Doctor, thank you. I understand about the tests. And you are right, I have been struggling to eat regular meals, as I mentioned. It’s not that I don't want to eat, it’s just that my appetite isn't very strong. And sometimes, I get so caught up in work that I forget to eat entirely. It’s a bad habit, I know. But it’s been difficult to break.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's easy to get caught up in things and forget about self-care. Let’s try to address that. Perhaps setting reminders on your phone to prompt you to eat, even if it's just a small snack. And focusing on nutrient-rich foods, even if you're not feeling particularly hungry. I also want to rule out any psychological factors contributing to your lack of appetite and fatigue. Sometimes stress or anxiety can manifest as physical symptoms. Have you been feeling particularly stressed or anxious lately?
PATIENT: That’s a very good point, Doctor. I have been feeling a bit stressed lately, yes. My work has been very demanding, and I'm always worried about meeting deadlines. Also, my husband and I… we've been having a few disagreements lately. Nothing major, but enough to cause some tension. I wouldn’t say I’m overly anxious, but I haven’t been feeling myself lately, emotionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It's not uncommon for stress and emotional tension to contribute to physical symptoms like fatigue and loss of appetite. It might be beneficial to explore some stress-reduction techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even talking to a therapist. I have some resources I can provide. For now, let's focus on getting those blood tests done and then we can review the results together and discuss a more comprehensive plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and understanding. And I do appreciate the resources you mentioned; I may take you up on those. I think getting the blood work done is the most important thing right now. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be expecting you. I’ll have my nurse contact you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
