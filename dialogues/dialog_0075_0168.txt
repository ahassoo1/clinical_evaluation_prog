DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd, as you know. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit personal, honestly. I’m dating someone new, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is…as it should be, before things progress any further. A woman needs to be cautious, you understand. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. That's very sensible of you. Your health and peace of mind are very important, and it’s good you’re taking these precautions. Medicare is relevant for billing, thank you for letting me know. So, to clarify, you're looking for a general health check-up with a focus on sexually transmitted infections, correct?
PATIENT: “Sexually transmitted infections?” Doctor, really. That’s…rather blunt, isn’t it? I simply want to ensure I am in good health overall. One doesn't immediately jump to…those conclusions. I suppose it could be relevant, but I hadn’t specifically phrased it that way. It feels a bit…presumptuous. I expect a certain level of discretion, you know.
DOCTOR: Please accept my apologies, Ms. Pandolfi. I didn’t mean to be insensitive or presumptuous. My intention was simply to be thorough, given the nature of your concerns about a new relationship. It’s standard practice to consider all possibilities when assessing a patient’s health. We can absolutely focus on a general health check-up, and we’ll only discuss further testing if you wish. Let’s start with a bit of background then. Can you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: Very well. I appreciate the clarification. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. I watch what I eat—mostly. And I do get some exercise, when I can fit it in. My weight has been…a little up and down lately, but nothing drastic. I haven’t been seriously ill in years, thank goodness. I do have occasional aches and pains, as one does at my age, but nothing that requires a doctor’s attention—usually. My husband, bless his soul, always said I worry too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s always positive to hear a patient is proactive about their well-being. And I understand completely about the occasional aches and pains; they come with age, as you said. You mentioned your husband. Has it been long since his passing?
PATIENT: It has been…three years, next month. It still feels quite recent, if I’m honest. He was a very…steady presence in my life. A practical man. We had a good marriage, a very good marriage. It’s…different now. A lot different. I don’t usually speak of it, if you don’t mind. It’s…private.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize for asking. It was insensitive of me. Please, don't feel pressured to share anything you're not comfortable with. We can certainly move on to discussing your current health concerns. Let’s talk about your medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been quite fortunate, health-wise. No chronic conditions, no major surgeries. I had my tonsils out as a child, but that was ages ago. My mother had some issues with arthritis in her later years, and my father…well, he wasn’t one for doctors. Stubborn man. But I myself have never had any serious medical problems, thank goodness. I do take a daily vitamin, if that’s relevant. A good multivitamin, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Ms. Pandolfi. A family history of arthritis is good to note, though. And a daily vitamin is always a positive step. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the multivitamin, are you currently taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, including any creams, ointments, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t take anything. I believe in letting my body heal itself, as much as possible. I don’t trust all those chemicals they put in medications. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, if it’s particularly bad, but that’s it. Just a simple ibuprofen, if needed. Nothing regular, you understand. I believe in a healthy diet and a good night’s sleep, those are far more effective than pills.
DOCTOR: I understand and respect your preference for a natural approach, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s always good to be mindful of what we put into our bodies. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing significant, anyway. I’m a little sensitive to certain perfumes, they give me a headache sometimes, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? And I once had a slight rash after eating strawberries as a child, but I haven’t eaten them in years. So, no, I wouldn’t say I have any serious allergies. Nothing that requires an EpiPen, certainly.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Pandolfi. Perfumes and a childhood rash are helpful information. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Is this truly necessary? I find the line of questioning rather…impertinent. I assure you, I lead a perfectly respectable life. I do not smoke. I rarely drink—perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly do not engage in any…recreational activities. I find the implication quite offensive, frankly. I expect a certain level of discretion and respect, you know. It's not often I find myself explaining my personal habits to a physician.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, please accept my deepest apologies. You are absolutely right to be upset. My intention was not to offend or judge, but to gather a complete health history as per standard medical practice. I understand and respect your boundaries, and I should have phrased my questions with more sensitivity. I truly apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. Let's move on to a different area then. Before we proceed with the physical exam, would you mind telling me a little about your current stress levels?
PATIENT: Stress? Well, that’s a loaded question, isn’t it? Life has been…disruptive, recently. Adjusting to things, you understand. Losing my husband was…a significant event. And starting a new relationship…it comes with its own anxieties. I wouldn’t say I’m overly stressed, but there’s definitely a level of…uncertainty. It’s not something I readily discuss, you know. It's a private matter. But I do try to manage it. I enjoy reading, and I take long walks when the weather permits. It helps to clear my head. But yes, there is stress. A reasonable amount, considering the circumstances.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable, Ms. Pandolfi. Grief and new relationships are both significant life changes, and it’s perfectly normal to experience stress. It's good you have coping mechanisms like reading and walking. Now, with your permission, I’d like to proceed with a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be quick and non-invasive. We can also discuss any specific concerns you may have during the exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be gentle. And I would appreciate a clear explanation of everything you’re doing. I don’t like surprises. And I would like to remain fully clothed, if you don't mind. I'm not accustomed to…unnecessary exposure. I trust you are a professional, Doctor, but one can never be too careful. Proceed, then. But gently, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I completely understand and respect your wishes. We will proceed at your pace, and you will remain fully clothed throughout the exam. I will explain everything I’m doing before I do it, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. I’m wrapping this cuff around your arm... …and now I’m inflating it. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now I'll check your pulse. Your pulse is 76 and regular. And finally, I'll take your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, if you’d be comfortable, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. It will just take a moment. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Everything sounds normal so far.
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. It’s…reassuring, I suppose. Though I still find the entire process a bit unsettling. Is that all? Are you finished now? I would like to know what this all means, Doctor. What are you looking for, exactly? And what does it say about my overall health? I don't appreciate being poked and prodded without a clear explanation of the purpose.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize for not explaining the purpose of the exam in more detail beforehand. I got carried away with the routine. The purpose of listening to your heart and lungs was to check for any abnormalities, such as irregular heartbeats, wheezing, or crackles, which could indicate underlying health issues. Fortunately, everything sounded normal. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could be due to stress, anxiety, or a number of other factors. We can monitor it over time to see if it returns to normal. Overall, based on this brief physical exam, you appear to be in generally good health. However, to get a more complete picture, I recommend some basic blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood work… hmm. I suppose it couldn’t hurt. But I don’t want a lot of vials taken, understand? And I would like a clear explanation of everything they’re looking for. No medical jargon, please. I expect to understand the results in plain English. And what is the cost? I do have Medicare, you know. I don’t want any unexpected bills. Proceed, then. But only if you can guarantee a thorough explanation and no hidden costs. I am a woman who demands transparency, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I completely understand and respect your wishes. We will only take the necessary vials for the basic blood work—a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your blood sugar and kidney function. I guarantee a thorough explanation of the results in plain English, and I will personally review them with you. We will submit the tests to Medicare, and I will ensure you are fully aware of any potential out-of-pocket costs beforehand. Our billing department will confirm your coverage and any applicable co-pays. I’ll write you a lab order now, and the phlebotomist will draw the blood. It will take just a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed, then. But be sure to inform the phlebotomist about my concerns. I don't like needles, you understand. And I would like to sit down while it's being done. I do not want to faint. Just…handle it efficiently, please. And keep me informed of the progress. I do not appreciate surprises. I trust you'll ensure everything is done professionally and with minimal discomfort. Write your order, and let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I will personally inform the phlebotomist about your concerns and ensure she is gentle and efficient. She will also make sure you are seated comfortably during the blood draw. Here is your lab order. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. She’s just finishing up with another patient, so it will be a few minutes. I’ll stay with you until she’s ready, and I’ll explain each step of the process beforehand. Would you like a glass of water while we wait?
PATIENT: Water would be nice, thank you. And please, Doctor, do not leave me unattended. I find the entire situation rather…nerve-wracking. It's reassuring to have someone present, explaining everything. I suppose it's foolish of me, but I've never been comfortable with medical procedures. Just…keep me informed. And make sure she uses a new needle, of course. One can never be too careful. Let’s get this over with quickly, please. The sooner it's done, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I will stay with you every step of the way, and I will personally ensure the phlebotomist uses a new, sterile needle. I understand your anxiety, and we will take things at your pace. Here is Ms. Pandolfi. She’s a little nervous about the blood draw, so please be gentle and explain each step clearly. The phlebotomist will clean your arm with an antiseptic wipe, then tie a tourniquet to help locate your vein. She’ll then insert the needle and collect the blood samples. It will take just a few minutes. She'll then remove the needle and apply pressure to the puncture site to stop any bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. But no sudden movements, understand? And I want to see the sealed vial before you send it off. I want to be certain it's properly labeled. I trust you’ll supervise the entire process? And if I feel faint, I want you to catch me. I do not want to end up on the floor. Proceed, then. But be gentle. And keep talking to me. Distraction is key, you know. Just…keep me informed of everything you’re doing. And please, no medical jargon. Plain English, Doctor. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I will stay with you throughout the entire process, and I will personally ensure everything is done gently and safely. I will explain each step in plain English and will keep you informed of everything we're doing. I will also make sure the vial is properly labeled before it’s sent to the lab. Please begin when you're ready. The phlebotomist is going to clean your arm with an antiseptic wipe now. This will help prevent infection. It may feel a little cold. Then, she’ll tie a tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. This will feel a little tight, but it shouldn't be painful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. But be quick about it. I do not like having things applied to my skin. And do not pull too tightly with the tourniquet. I have delicate veins, you understand. This is all rather…unsettling. Just…keep talking to me. Distraction is key, you know. Tell me something…anything. About the weather, perhaps? Or the local news? Anything to take my mind off this…ordeal. And please, assure me that everything is being done hygienically. I do not want to contract any…unpleasant infections. This is all rather…nerve-wracking. Proceed, then. But be gentle. And keep talking. Keep talking.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand your anxiety, and I will keep talking to distract you. And I assure you, the phlebotomist is extremely careful and follows strict hygienic protocols. Everything is done with sterile equipment to prevent any infections. Well, the weather has been rather unpredictable lately, hasn't it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. But it's dreadfully humid, isn't it? It's enough to ruin one's hairstyle. And the mosquitos are simply atrocious this year. Simply atrocious. I had to spray myself with repellent just to step outside yesterday. And even then, I was bitten on the ankle! It's simply dreadful. I do hope it rains soon, to clear the air. But not too much rain, of course. I don't want to ruin my garden. It's a delicate balance, you understand. A delicate balance. Just...be quick about it. This is all rather...unsettling. Is she finished now? Is she actually finished? I can feel my pulse racing. It's simply dreadful. Dreadful, I tell you. Just...hurry.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Ms. Pandolfi. Just breathe deeply. We’re almost finished. The phlebotomist is now inserting the needle. You may feel a brief pinch, but it will be over quickly. Please let me know if you need anything. Just focus on your breathing, Ms. Pandolfi. You’re doing a fantastic job. And yes, she’s almost finished collecting the samples. You may feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I promise. You're doing great.
PATIENT: Ooh! That was…unpleasant. Very unpleasant. Are you certain it’s sterile? Are you absolutely certain? I do not want to contract anything. This is simply dreadful. Dreadful, I tell you. How much longer? How much longer will this…ordeal last? I feel faint. I truly feel faint. Just…hurry. Hurry, please. This is simply too much. Too much, I tell you. Just…get it over with. Get it over with quickly. And please, assure me that everything is being done properly. Properly, I tell you. This is simply too much stress for one afternoon. Too much. Just…hurry.
DOCTOR: You’re doing incredibly well, Ms. Pandolfi. Just a few more seconds. The phlebotomist is almost finished collecting the samples. Almost there. Yes, I can assure you everything is being done properly. The phlebotomist is extremely careful and follows strict hygienic protocols. She’s using a new, sterile needle and is following all safety guidelines. You’re doing fantastic. Just breathe deeply. There, all done. The needle is out now. She’s applying pressure to stop the bleeding. Just a little pressure for a few more seconds. You’re doing wonderfully. You've handled this beautifully. You’ve been very brave.
PATIENT: Hmm. It's…over? Truly over? It certainly felt like an eternity. Are you certain it's not bleeding? Are you absolutely certain? I do not want to ruin my dress. It's…rather unsettling, this whole process. Very unsettling. I think I need to lie down. I truly need to lie down. This has been…quite traumatic. Perhaps a glass of lemonade would help? And a quiet room, where I can simply…recover. Yes, a quiet room and a glass of lemonade. That would be…most appreciated. Is that possible? Just…a quiet room and a glass of lemonade. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. You handled that beautifully. It's perfectly normal to feel shaken up after a blood draw, especially if you’re not fond of needles. Thank you for your patience and care. I will personally escort you to a quiet room where you can rest and recover. And of course, I will gladly get you a glass of lemonade. Just let me arrange it. Let's get you comfortable. We have a lovely quiet room just down the hall. You deserve to rest and recover after that ordeal. And the lemonade will be ready shortly. Is there anything else I can get you?
PATIENT: Hmm. A cool compress would be nice. For my arm. It’s…rather tender. And perhaps a small blanket? I do feel a bit…chilled. And a quiet room, you say? Truly quiet? No…unexpected noises? I do not want to be startled. Just a quiet room, with a cool compress and a small blanket. And the lemonade, of course. Is there a comfortable chair? A reclining chair, perhaps? I do not want to strain my back. Yes, a quiet room, with a cool compress, a small blanket, a comfortable reclining chair, and the lemonade. That would be…most appreciated. Lead the way, please. And please, be gentle. This has been…quite traumatic, you know. Quite traumatic, indeed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand. We will make sure you are as comfortable as possible. Could you please prepare a cool compress and a small blanket for Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: A cool compress and a small blanket…yes, that would be…most appreciated. You're very kind, you know. Very kind indeed. Is there a television in the room? Perhaps a nature program? Something…soothing? I do not want to watch the news. Too…disturbing. And please, be certain the room is…tranquil. No…unexpected visitors? I do not want to be startled. Just a tranquil room, with a cool compress, a small blanket, and a nature program. That would be…most appreciated. Lead the way, please. And please, be gentle. This has been…quite traumatic, you know. Quite traumatic, indeed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. We will make sure everything is exactly as you wish. Here we are. This room is very tranquil, and the nurse has already prepared a cool compress and a small blanket for you. There’s a television, and I’ll gladly change the channel to a nature program. Here you go. Just relax and let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll leave you to rest for a bit, but I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Is there anything else I can get you?
PATIENT: Hmm. The lighting is…acceptable. And the chair is…tolerable. It’s…sufficient. Is there a remote control? And please, be certain the channel is…peaceful. No…disturbing images? It’s…cool. Sufficiently cool. It’s…functioning. Is there a call button? In case of…emergencies? Just in case. And please, be certain I will not be disturbed. No…unexpected visitors? Just in case. And perhaps a glass of water? Just in case. Just a quiet room, with a cool compress, a small blanket, a glass of water, and a peaceful nature program. That would be…most appreciated. Please, be gentle. This has been…quite traumatic, you know. Quite traumatic, indeed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand. Here you go. A lovely nature program, and the volume is adjusted to your liking. Here is the call button. Please don't hesitate to press it if you need anything at all. I will be right outside. And here is a glass of water. Just in case. Is there anything else I can get you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s…water. Acceptable. It’s…wet. Sufficiently wet. The program is…peaceful. Sufficiently peaceful. It’s…quiet. Sufficiently quiet. It’s…there. Sufficiently there. And please, be certain I will not be disturbed. No…unexpected visitors? Just in case. And perhaps a small pillow? Just in case. Just a quiet room, with a cool compress, a small blanket, a glass of water, a peaceful nature program, and a small pillow. That would be…most appreciated. Please, be gentle. This has been…quite traumatic, you know. Quite traumatic, indeed.)
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. Here you go. A small pillow for your comfort. Now, just relax and let me know if you need anything at all. I will be right outside if you need anything. I’ll leave you to rest now. Just call if you need anything. .
