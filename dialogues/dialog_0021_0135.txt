DOCTOR: Right, Gerhard Radillo. Sixty years old. Well, hello there. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. It started, let me think… about three days ago, I believe.
DOCTOR: Three days ago… leaking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, leaking. A liquid. Not… not a lot, but enough I noticed. Clear liquid, I think. Perhaps a little bit yellow, but not much. It makes my ear feel… full. And a little bit itchy, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Itchy and full… and clear, possibly yellowish discharge. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not pain. Not really. A little bit of discomfort, maybe, if I touch it. But not pain, no. It is more… annoying, than painful. And it makes it hard to hear well, on that side.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Any fever, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Fever? Let me think… no, I do not think so. I checked my temperature yesterday, and it was normal. Perhaps a little warm, but not a fever, I am sure. I feel… normal, other than the ear.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any recent ear infections, or had any trouble with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, when I was a boy. Many years ago. I had… something. An infection, I think. I was very young, so I do not remember much. I had to take medicine. And… something with cotton. But that was a very long time ago. Nothing since then, until now.
DOCTOR: And what about swimming recently?
PATIENT: Swimming? No, Doctor. Not for many months. Not since the winter. I do not swim much. I prefer to stay indoors, mostly. Too cold for swimming, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look at it. If you could just sit here and let me have a quick look in your ear… it'll only take a moment.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Whatever you need. Please be gentle, if you would be so kind. It is… sensitive, you see. I will sit very still.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, it is a bit red inside, and I can see some fluid… looks like there's some wax build-up too. The ear drum itself looks intact, thankfully, but it’s difficult to get a really good look with all the…congestion. "Tympanic membrane visualized with difficulty due to cerumen and fluid. No obvious perforation noted." I'm going to gently irrigate the ear to clear out some of the wax and see if we can get a better view. It might feel a little strange, but shouldn’t be painful. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. If it will help you to see better, then please do so. As long as it is not painful. I trust your judgment. Just… tell me if it will be cold. I do not like cold water in my ear.
DOCTOR: It won’t be cold, Gerhard. It’s body temperature. Alright, just lean your head to the side a bit… I'm going to gently flush your ear with some warm water. Okay… much better. There’s still some redness and a bit of fluid, but no perforation. It looks like otitis externa – swimmer’s ear, even though you haven't been swimming. It could be caused by a little bit of moisture getting trapped in there. "Otitis externa suspected. Mild inflammation noted. Tympanic membrane intact."
PATIENT: “Otitis… externa?” What does that mean, Doctor? And what will you do about it? I do not want it to get worse. Is it… serious? I have a meeting next week, you see. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: It means inflammation of the outer ear canal. It's not usually serious, Gerhard, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, it can worsen. We’ll treat it with some ear drops – antibiotic and steroid to reduce the inflammation and fight any infection. I’ll give you a prescription for that. And I want you to keep your ear dry. No swimming, and be careful in the shower – maybe use a cotton ball with a little bit of vaseline to plug your ear. It shouldn’t affect your meeting, but avoid getting water in it. Here you go. Use these twice a day for seven days. If it doesn’t improve after a week, or if you develop any pain, or fever, or discharge, then come back and see me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Twice a day for seven days. Keep it dry. No swimming. Cotton and… vaseline. Yes, I understand. And… will the drops hurt? And what if they do not work? I do not want to miss my meeting. It is very important.
DOCTOR: The drops shouldn’t hurt, Gerhard. They might feel a little cold initially, but that should pass quickly. And most of the time, they work very well. It’s unlikely they won’t work. But if they don’t, we can try a different type, or I can refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose and throat doctor. However, I suspect with a little care and these drops, you’ll be perfectly fine for your meeting. Now, do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you for your time. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help. I will follow your instructions carefully. Perhaps… perhaps a little more explanation about the cotton? Where exactly should I put it? And… how much vaseline?
DOCTOR: Alright, Gerhard. Put a very small amount of vaseline – just a tiny dab – on the cotton ball. And gently insert it into your ear canal, just enough to block the water from getting in. Don’t push it in too far! You don’t want to impact the wax. It's just to create a barrier. Like this. You really don’t need a lot. And remove it after showering or swimming. Is that clear enough?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is much clearer. A tiny amount of vaseline. Gently. Do not push it in. Remove it afterward. I think… I think I understand. Thank you. You have been very patient with me. I will be sure to follow your instructions carefully. And I will see you again if it does not improve. Good day, Doctor.
