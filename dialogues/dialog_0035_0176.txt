DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it's really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… hmm, let me think… Tuesday afternoon, I believe. I was setting up for the luau at the resort – lots of little details, you know? And then hic – one just popped up. I didn’t think much of it at first, they usually go away on their own. But they kept coming, and they’re still here. They’re not terribly painful, just… annoying. Really annoying. And a bit embarrassing when I’m talking to guests.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started Tuesday afternoon while you were setting up for the luau, and they’ve been pretty consistent since then. You said they're not painful, just disruptive. Have you tried anything to make them stop?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Everything my mother told me, and a few things I read online. Holding my breath, drinking water really fast, getting someone to scare me… even a spoonful of sugar. Nothing seems to work for more than a minute or two, if that. It's exhausting, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve tried quite a few home remedies already. And it's good you've tried things, but since they're persisting for this long, we should look into it a bit more. Do you have any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chest pain. I haven’t had any trouble breathing. My stomach feels okay, maybe a little… gassy? But I always get a bit gassy, honestly. I haven’t noticed anything else particularly different. I’m eating normally, drinking my usual amount of water… oh! And I haven't taken any new medications. Just my usual vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chest pain, no trouble breathing, a little gas, normal eating and drinking, and no new medications – just your vitamins. That's helpful. Now, have you had hiccups that lasted this long before?
PATIENT: No, never. Usually, they just go away after a few minutes, maybe an hour at most. This is… unusual. I’ve had the occasional bout, you know, like after a big meal or something, but nothing like this. It’s really worrying me, to be honest. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Persistent hiccups like this can be a bit concerning. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure we haven't overlooked anything. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had pneumonia when I was a child, a pretty bad case, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Other than that… no, not really. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I do have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Doctor, I’m on lisinopril, 20 milligrams a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and currently taking lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure. Thank you. And what about family history?
PATIENT: My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems. His side of the family… well, they had a lot of stomach issues, if I'm being honest. Lots of indigestion, things like that. But nothing major, nothing like cancer or anything. It's a big family, so it’s hard to keep track, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and a family history of some digestive issues. And just to be thorough, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week, but that’s it. And I definitely don't do any drugs. I need a clear head for my job, you know? Setting up events takes focus.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead, Doctor. I hope you find something! It’s just… exhausting living with these hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Redeye. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I do note some mild bloating. Okay, everything seems normal on the physical exam so far. Given the duration of your hiccups and the fact that home remedies haven’t worked, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes. We'll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but it's best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. I just want to get this sorted out. Blood tests sound fine. Will I need to fast for them? And where will I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw, so that means no food or drinks other than water. You can go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital, it’s just down the road from here. I’ll print out a requisition form for you now. Here you go. They are open until 5pm today, so you should be able to get it done easily. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, if the hiccups get much worse, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly. Eight-hour fast, Suburban General Hospital, and ER if things get worse. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. Hopefully, it’s just something simple. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, besides fasting? Perhaps a particular position I should try when the hiccups strike?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Redeye. As for things you can try, there's not a lot of strong evidence, but some people find relief by drinking ice water slowly, or by pulling your knees to your chest. You could also try breathing into a paper bag – just a paper bag, not plastic – for a short period of time. But if those don’t help, don’t push it. We’ll get these blood tests done and hopefully get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and rest. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Ice water, knees to chest, paper bag… I’ll give those a try. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I’ll let you know as soon as I get the test results. I suppose I'll see you next week, then? Or will you call me when the results are in?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I'll give the lab a call and, as soon as I have the results, my staff will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. It'll likely be next week, yes. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Get some rest, and I hope these hiccups subside soon. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
