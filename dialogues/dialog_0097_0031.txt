DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Georgiou. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been a bit troubling, and I know I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes. The teachers at the college said I should come get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and some unusual heartbeats. That’s good information to start with. Let's try to get a clearer picture of both of those things. First, let's talk about the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, about a week ago. At first, it wasn’t too bad, just a little puffiness around my ankle, really. But it’s gotten worse each day, and now it’s… well, you can see. It goes all the way up my calf now. I haven’t knocked it or anything.
DOCTOR: Right, a week ago, starting at the ankle and progressing up the calf, without any injury. Is it painful?
PATIENT: It’s not sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… heavy ache, if that makes sense? Especially at the end of the day. And it feels… tight. Like something is pressing on it. It’s uncomfortable, but I wouldn’t say it’s a terrible pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy ache and tightness, worse at the end of the day. That gives me a better idea. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Well… putting my feet up helps a little. And I’ve been trying to keep it elevated whenever I can. It doesn’t completely take the ache away, but it feels a bit less… bothered when it’s up in the air. I haven’t tried anything else, to be honest. I wasn’t sure what to do.
DOCTOR: Good, elevation does seem to help. And you're right to come get it checked out. Now, let's talk about this funny heartbeat you mentioned. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It doesn’t feel like a normal beat. It’s like it’s… fluttering? And sometimes it’s very fast, like my chest is racing. Other times it feels like it skips a beat altogether. It doesn’t happen all the time, just comes and goes. It usually only lasts for a little while, then goes back to normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluttering, racing, and sometimes skipping beats, coming and going. And how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It’s not every day. Maybe… once or twice a week? Sometimes it happens more if I’ve been walking a lot or… stressed. But it’s hard to say for sure. I haven’t really kept track, if that makes sense. I just… notice it when it happens.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's helpful to know it's related to activity and stress. Do you feel dizzy or lightheaded when this happens?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not every time, but when it’s really fast, I feel a bit… woozy. Like I might faint, but I haven’t actually fainted. Just a bit unsteady on my feet. It usually passes when the heartbeat goes back to normal. It frightens me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand why it would be frightening. Okay, so we have a swollen leg, and these episodes of a fast or irregular heartbeat with occasional dizziness. Let me ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… the doctor at home told me I have something called… atrial fibrillation. That was a few years ago now. He put me on some medicine for it, but I stopped taking it a while back. It wasn't agreeing with me, and he said it was okay to stop if I wasn't having too many problems. Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but… I wasn’t sure what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation diagnosed previously, and you stopped the medication due to side effects. Thank you for being so open about that. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t had any surgeries. And I’ve never been in the hospital, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, but this leg… and the heartbeat… it’s starting to worry me. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything at the moment. I stopped everything when I stopped the medicine for my… atrial fibrillation. I don’t really take vitamins either. I try to eat a good diet, but… I suppose I could be doing better.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with heart problems, blood clots, or leg swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a bad heart. He was very ill for a long time before he passed away. And my aunt… she had a blood clot in her leg a few years ago. She was very poorly, and had to go to the hospital. I don't know anything else, to be honest. I don't talk to my family very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandfather with heart problems and an aunt with a blood clot. That's helpful to know. And finally, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never have. I don’t approve of it at all. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine. Thank you for all of that information, Nixon. It gives me a much clearer picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your leg. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the exam table. I’m going to listen to your heart rhythm and breathing. Alright. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear a bit of irregularity. Your lungs sound clear, though. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. Okay. Your left leg is noticeably swollen, especially around your calf, and it's warmer to the touch than your right leg. There’s some tenderness when I press here, but nothing too severe. I also see some redness. I’m going to measure the circumference of both legs to get a more precise reading of the swelling. Okay, your left leg is about 3 centimeters larger in circumference than your right leg. This confirms the swelling. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it’s possible you’re experiencing a flare-up of your atrial fibrillation, which could be contributing to the leg swelling. However, it’s also important to rule out other possibilities, such as a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. We need to do some tests to determine the cause of the swelling.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A DVT… that sounds rather serious. What sort of tests do I need? And what happens if it is a DVT? I'm starting to feel quite worried now. Is there anything I should be doing right now?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Nixon. A DVT can be serious, but we'll get to the bottom of this. The primary test we need to do is a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your veins and check for any clots. If it is a DVT, treatment typically involves blood thinners to prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of complications, like a pulmonary embolism. Right now, it's important to avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and try to keep your leg elevated as much as possible. We will need to get this ultrasound done quickly. I'm going to write a referral order for you now. Do you have a preferred imaging center, or would you like me to recommend one nearby?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… reasonable. A Doppler ultrasound. I don’t have a preference for an imaging center, Doctor. If you could recommend one nearby, that would be most helpful. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It does make me feel a bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Should I avoid walking altogether? I have a class to teach tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns a bit. Okay, let me recommend the City Imaging Center. It’s just a few blocks from here, and they usually have same-day appointments. I’ll fax over the referral order now. Regarding your class tomorrow, I wouldn’t advise completely avoiding walking, but I would limit strenuous activity and try to take breaks to elevate your leg whenever possible. If you experience any new or worsening pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It's better to be safe than sorry. While we are waiting for the ultrasound results, I'm going to prescribe a short course of compression stockings for you. These will help improve blood flow in your leg and reduce the swelling. I’ll write the prescription now. Is there anything else you’re concerned about right now?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… alright. That sounds manageable. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I am a little worried, of course, but I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly and taking the time to listen to me. I’ll go to City Imaging Center as soon as I can. Is there anything else I should bring with me to the appointment, besides my identification?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help. No, besides your identification, you shouldn't need to bring anything else to the appointment. Just make sure you're comfortable, and let them know about your history of atrial fibrillation. I’m also going to give you a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the referral order, the prescription for the compression stockings, and some information about atrial fibrillation and DVTs. Once you have the ultrasound results, please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to contact us. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all of my questions, and I feel much more informed now. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I’ll go and schedule the ultrasound right away. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help. Please, take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and I’ll speak with you soon. .
