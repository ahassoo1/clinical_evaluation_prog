DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation, and people seem to find it helpful. I was hoping to maybe learn a little about it, see if it could… calm things down a bit, you know? I work out on the tracks, and it can be stressful, making sure everything is safe. Not dangerous, exactly, but… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. I keep seeing articles online, and my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she swears by it. She used to be really anxious, but she says it’s changed everything for her. I don’t really… know where to start, though. Or even what it really is, beyond just… sitting and breathing? Is that all there is to it?
DOCTOR: Well, it sounds simple, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: It does! But everything simple always seems to have a lot more to it when you actually try it, doesn’t it? Like… baking a cake. It sounds easy, but then you get into different flours and temperatures and… Oh, never mind. I’m rambling. I just… I’d like to understand if it’s something that could actually help me, and if it is, how to get started. Is there a class, or… something?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you're coming to a doctor about learning to… relax?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I thought doctors sometimes recommended things like this? For stress, and… being overwhelmed? I didn’t know I was… doing it wrong? I just thought you might have suggestions. Maybe resources in the area? It’s just… everything feels a bit much lately, and I’m trying to find ways to cope. I apologize if I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a Family Medicine physician. I deal with actual medical issues. Elevated blood pressure, diabetes, things you can treat with medication or procedures. Not…feelings. I’m not a therapist. Perhaps you’d be better served looking into counseling services?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I didn’t realize… I just… thought it might be something a doctor could help with, like you said, stress. I apologize again for taking up your time. So, no, you don’t have any resources for mindfulness or meditation? Even just a website, maybe? I’ll… I’ll look into counseling, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Hold on a minute. Don’t get your hopes up. Let me just quickly see what’s in your chart… Sometimes the system has links to community resources. But truly, I wouldn't expect much. "Stress management… community… ugh."
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking, even if you don’t find anything. I know you’re busy, and I really didn’t mean to take up your time with something… silly. I just… I’m trying to be proactive, you know? Keep myself healthy. And sometimes that means trying new things, even if they seem a little… out there.
DOCTOR: Here. There's a website for… some sort of local wellness center. It mentions meditation classes. Honestly, it looks… New Age-y. But it’s something. Don’t expect miracles. And I still strongly recommend talking to a qualified mental health professional. There’s also a number for the county mental health services listed. Now, is there anything actual medically concerning I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor, that’s… very kind of you. I’ll definitely check out the website. And I will look into mental health services, you’re right. No, nothing else medically concerning. Just… trying to manage things, as you said. Thank you for your time. I apologize again for bothering you with this. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, have a good day, Ms. Sugino. And if anything serious comes up, don’t hesitate to call. .
