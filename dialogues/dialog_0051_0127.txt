DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, you see, and my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s been getting worse over the last few months, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… and you said this has been progressing over months. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, progressing, that’s right. It started with my arms, I think. Just feeling tired more easily when I was working – I manage facilities, so there’s a fair bit of lifting and moving things around. Now, it’s… well, it’s in my legs too. Climbing stairs is becoming quite difficult, and I find myself needing to sit down after only short walks. It’s not painful, exactly, just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began in your arms with fatigue during work, specifically lifting, and has now spread to your legs, making stairs and walking difficult. No pain, just exhaustion. And you mentioned drooping eyelids… Is that happening on one side more than the other, or both sides equally?
PATIENT: It's… both sides, I believe. It's hard to be certain, but I think it’s about the same on both. My ex-wife always pointed things like that out, and she was very observant, but… well. It's just noticeable when I look in the mirror, you know? It makes me look very tired, even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, bilateral ptosis – drooping of both eyelids – and you’ve noticed it in the mirror. Has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I’ve been having a bit of trouble with… double vision sometimes. Not constantly, but when I’m tired, especially in the evenings. And… oh, now that I think about it, my speech feels a little… slurred sometimes. Not all the time, but I’ve noticed people asking me to repeat myself more often recently. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are definitely things we need to explore. Can you tell me more about the double vision?
PATIENT: It's… it’s not like seeing two completely separate images, you understand. It’s more like things are a bit blurry, or… wobbly. And it's usually later in the day, when I’m tired. Like I said, it doesn’t happen all the time. It's hard to explain. It's just… not as crisp as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry or "wobbly" vision, worse with fatigue. Thank you. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I mean, I had chickenpox when I was a child, like everyone else, and I broke my arm once when I was playing football. But nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized or had any major illnesses. I don't take any regular medication, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a tricky one. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from a heart attack, I believe. And my mother… she’s still alive, but she’s not very well. She has… I think it’s arthritis, and some memory problems. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had something… something about her muscles, I remember my mother saying, but I don’t recall the details. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very interested in medical things then. I'm sorry, I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. Anything is helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. And… well, I used to smoke, but I gave it up about five years ago. I don't drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I live alone, and… well, work keeps me busy. Not much social life, to be honest. I'm divorced, as you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, former smoker, quit five years ago, minimal alcohol. Thank you. Now, I'd like to conduct a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll check your strength, reflexes, and… take a look at your eyes a bit more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I’m a bit worried, so the sooner we find out what's wrong, the better. I'll do whatever I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit comfortably. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes – just look in the direction I’m pointing. Okay, good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Here you go… It’s… a bit wobbly, as you can see. I'm trying, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, let me take a closer look at your eyes… Alright, Gedalya. Based on the examination, your symptoms – the weakness, drooping eyelids, double vision, slurred speech – along with the tremor in your hands and the unsteady gait… they point towards a possible neuromuscular issue. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but I’m concerned about Myasthenia Gravis. It's an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: My… what was it? My-a-sthenia… Gravis? I… I don’t think so. An autoimmune… is that serious? I mean, I feel weak, but… I haven’t been to the hospital. I’ve just been… tired. It sounds… frightening. Is there a test? Can you… can you fix it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern. Myasthenia Gravis can be a serious condition, but it’s often manageable with treatment. It’s not a death sentence, and many people live full and productive lives with it. It's an autoimmune disorder, meaning your body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own muscles. The symptoms – the weakness and fatigue – come and go, and they're often worse later in the day, which explains why you've noticed them getting progressively worse. Yes, there are tests we can do to confirm the diagnosis. The most common is a blood test to look for specific antibodies. We can also do a special test called an edrophonium test, where we give you a medication that temporarily improves muscle strength. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, there are several treatment options available, including medications to suppress the immune system and, in some cases, surgery. I’m going to order a blood test right away. I also want you to schedule an appointment with a neurologist, a specialist in disorders of the nervous system, for further evaluation and testing. In the meantime, it's important to avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen significantly – such as difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… a bit better, knowing there are tests. And a specialist. I’d like that. And… the emergency room if it gets worse. I’ll remember that. Okay. Blood test… and a neurologist. Can you… can you write that down for me? I’m not very good at remembering things these days. And… what about work? I mean, I manage facilities… I need to lift things, and… I can’t just stop working. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?
DOCTOR: Here you are. Dr. Anya Sharma, she’s excellent. And the lab is just across the street. Regarding work, it’s difficult to say definitively without a diagnosis, but given your symptoms, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects. You could potentially explore temporary light duties, if possible, but it's important to prioritize your health. I can write a note to your employer explaining that you’re undergoing medical evaluation and may need to modify your work duties temporarily. It won't disclose your specific condition, just that you have a medical issue requiring adjustments. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. A note to my employer would be… very helpful. They’re not very understanding people, to be honest. It’s a small company, and they expect a lot. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. It’s just… all a bit overwhelming. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And writing the note. I’ll schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as I get home. And… I’ll try to rest. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or watching out for? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I understand it’s overwhelming, but we’ll take it one step at a time. Just keep an eye on your symptoms. If you experience any difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speech, or if your double vision worsens significantly, please go to the emergency room immediately. Also, be aware that some medications can worsen Myasthenia Gravis, so it’s important to tell any doctor you see that you’re being evaluated for this condition. I'll also send the lab results to Dr. Sharma once they're available. And please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Here's our number. And again, please prioritize your health and get plenty of rest. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any final questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. Really. You’ve… you’ve taken a lot off my mind. I’ll schedule the appointment and… I’ll try to rest. Good afternoon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Gedalya. Take care. And don't hesitate to reach out. .
