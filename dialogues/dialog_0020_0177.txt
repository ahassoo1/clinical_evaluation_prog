DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? Well...it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. It’s...down there. Something’s leaking. Not good. A man shouldn't be leaking.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. It's not embarrassing at all to discuss these things, and you've come to the right place. We'll figure out what's going on. When did you first notice this leakage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice it? Let me think…It’s been a little while now. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say, really. I don’t pay much attention to those things these days. Old age, you know? Things just…happen. It’s not like it hurts or anything, just...unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. And you’re right, these things can be subtle. Just to get a clearer picture, would you describe the leakage for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean? It's...wet. It's a fluid, obviously. Not like water, though. Thicker. And…yellowish, I think. Maybe. Honestly, I don't examine myself closely, Doctor. That’s just not something a man does.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your honesty, Jimmi. It sounds like we need to take a closer look. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the leakage?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm…let me see. Well, I've been a bit…tired lately. But I’m always tired. Old age, you know? And maybe a little…itchy down there, now that you mention it. But that could just be my clothes, they're not very comfortable. Everything is uncomfortable these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and possible itching. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, goodness. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor! I had a bad cold once, a really bad one. And my knees bother me something awful, but that’s just old age. And I think I had the measles when I was a boy. That's about all I can remember, honestly. I don't go to doctors much. Never have. They just tell you to stop doing the things you like!
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think…Oh! My tonsils. When I was very young, a long time ago. That’s the only thing I can remember. It was quite painful, I recall. They took them right out. I haven't had anything done since then, not unless you count getting a tooth pulled.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, I had a lot of brothers and sisters. Most of them are gone now, passed on. They all lived long lives, as far as I know. I don’t really know much about their health, we didn't talk about those things. They were busy with their own lives, and I was busy with mine. It wasn’t a close family, not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean by that? I mostly stay home. Read the newspaper, watch TV. I used to fish a lot, but my knees won't let me anymore. I don’t drink much, maybe a little beer sometimes with the news. And I don't smoke. Never did. A quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Jimmi?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. Just some cream for my knees sometimes, from the drugstore. It doesn't really help much, but it feels nice to rub it on. Nothing the doctor ever gave me, though. Just over-the-counter stuff. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They always have side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. What does that involve? I’m not…I don't like being poked and prodded, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something to stop the leaking?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jimmi. It’s not pleasant, I agree. But a quick exam will help me understand the cause of the leakage, and ensure we're giving you the best possible care. It will involve a gentle examination of the area, just to look for any obvious causes. We can take things slowly, and you can tell me to stop at any time. It's important to rule out anything serious. Just a basic look, that’s all. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you say it’s necessary. But be gentle, please. Very gentle. And don't take too long. This is embarrassing enough as it is! And tell me what you’re doing as you go. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jimmi. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything I’m doing before I do it. We’ll start by just taking a look at the area. I need to visually inspect the skin for any redness, swelling, or any obvious source of the leakage. I'll also gently palpate – that just means I’ll feel the area to check for any tenderness or unusual masses. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. I'm going to start now… Okay. I’m just going to gently lift the skin here… Hmm. I do see some mild redness and…some discharge. It appears to be coming from the urethra. There's no obvious pain when I touch this area, but there is some slight swelling.
PATIENT: Urethra? What's a urethra? Is that serious? It doesn’t hurt, you said, right? Just a little swelling? Oh dear. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it something I caught?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, let's take a breath. The urethra is just the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. Seeing redness and discharge can be a sign of an infection, but it can also be caused by other things. Because of the discharge, the most likely possibility is a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, it’s also important to rule out other things, especially given your age. UTIs aren’t necessarily “caught” – they can happen for a number of reasons. But we need to confirm with some tests to know for sure. The swelling is mild, which is a good sign, but it still needs to be investigated. Would you be willing to provide a urine sample so we can send it to the lab?
PATIENT: A urine sample? Oh, alright. I can do that, I suppose. I did go to the bathroom before I came here. Is that okay? And what kind of tests? Are they going to poke and prod me even more?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine that you went to the bathroom before you came, Jimmi. It's still best to get a fresh sample, if possible, just for accuracy. It helps to have a sample that is more concentrated. We can provide a cup in the bathroom, and instructions on how to collect a “clean-catch” sample – that just means wiping the area clean before you start. As for other tests, right now the main test is the urine analysis to see if there’s an infection present. If that comes back positive, we can discuss antibiotic options. We may also want to consider a basic blood test just to rule out anything else. No poking or prodding beyond the urine sample and blood draw. Do you feel comfortable getting a sample now?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A clean-catch, you say? What does that even involve? This is getting complicated. But if it means finding out what’s wrong, I suppose I can try. Just tell me exactly what to do. I’m an old man, Doctor, I need things explained slowly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. No problem at all. It’s very straightforward. Here’s a cup and these instructions. Essentially, we want to get a sample of urine that isn't contaminated with bacteria from your skin. First, you’ll wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Then, you’ll clean the area around your urethra with the antiseptic wipes I’ll provide – wiping from front to back. Now, before you actually start urinating, you’ll let a small amount of urine flow into the toilet – just to rinse away any bacteria. Then, you’ll collect the midstream urine into the cup – that means after that initial flow, you collect about two ounces of urine. Finally, you'll finish urinating into the toilet as usual. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…complicated. Rinse away bacteria? Midstream? I barely understand regular things, let alone midstreams! But alright, alright. I’ll try my best. Just…point me to the bathroom. And be ready for a lot of splashing. I’m not a very steady hand these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. Take your time. There’s no rush at all. And don’t worry about splashing – we’ve seen it all. Just focus on getting a clean sample, and do the best you can. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. If you have any trouble, just call out and I’ll come assist you. Let me know if you need any help!
