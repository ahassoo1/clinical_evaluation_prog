DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, truthfully. I’ve been going to the bathroom rather frequently lately. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Just… recently, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Recently" is a rather imprecise term, Ms. MacVittie. Could you attempt to pinpoint a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, I apologize. Let me think… Perhaps… three or four weeks, maybe? It feels like it’s been escalating over that time, but I truly can’t be certain. It’s… frustrating, not being able to recall specifics. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: While imprecise recall isn’t ideal, Ms. MacVittie, it’s not uncommon. However, accuracy is vital for proper diagnosis. Three to four weeks. And is this frequency… constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates. Some days it's… manageable, you know? I can go a couple of hours between trips to the bathroom. Other days… it feels like I'm constantly needing to go. Especially at night, which is… quite disruptive to my sleep. I don’t… I don’t recall this ever happening before.
DOCTOR: "Manageable" and "constantly" are still subjective terms, Ms. MacVittie. Could you provide a rough estimate of how many times you are urinating in a 24-hour period on a "normal" day versus a "bad" day?
PATIENT: Oh… good gracious. I hadn’t really counted, Doctor. That feels… a bit strange to think about. Let me see… On a normal day, perhaps… six or seven times? And on a bad day… oh, dear. I would say… easily twelve or more. Perhaps even more than that. I really haven't been keeping track, I'm afraid. Is that… is that a lot? I feel rather silly having to discuss this in such detail.
DOCTOR: It is important to have concrete data, Ms. MacVittie. This isn't a matter of silliness, it's medicine. Twelve or more times daily is certainly… elevated. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain or burning. That’s… that’s what’s so puzzling about it, I think. It’s just… the frequency. It feels like a constant pressure, a need to go, but it doesn’t hurt. And… and there’s no blood, if that’s what you were going to ask. I… I try to be very aware of these things. It’s just… quite inconvenient, and I'm terribly tired from having to get up so much at night.
DOCTOR: No dysuria or hematuria. Good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh. I… I suppose not. It looks… normal, I think. The usual color. No… no foam. No… unpleasant smell, that I’ve noticed. Honestly, I don’t usually pay much attention to it, Doctor. I know I should, but… I don’t. It just seems… rather personal, to scrutinize one’s own urine. Is that a… silly thing to say?
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, while I appreciate your candor, a thorough medical assessment requires a degree of… objectivity. Now, let us move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… well, let me think. I was divorced a few years back, if that counts as a… condition. Beyond that… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. And… and I had a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but I recovered fully. I don’t… I don’t recall any serious diagnoses, Doctor. I’m not insured, so I don't see a doctor very often. If I can help it.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history. Divorces are not medical conditions, Ms. MacVittie. Now, any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes. When I was quite young—perhaps eight or nine years old—I had my tonsils removed. And… and I had my wisdom teeth taken out as a young adult. That’s… that’s all I can recall, Doctor. It was quite a long time ago. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that… is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: A complete recall of past procedures is, ideally, preferable, Ms. MacVittie, but we will proceed. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some sort of heart trouble, later in life. He passed away several years ago. I don't… I don't recall any other significant illnesses in my family, Doctor. My family wasn't very forthcoming with medical details, I'm afraid. It was… a rather private household.
DOCTOR: Hypertension and cardiac issues in first-degree relatives. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Never have. I find it… quite appalling, actually. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week. But… that’s all. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. It’s difficult, with my job, but… I do.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. Though, I avoid taking medication whenever possible. I prefer to… let things run their course, if you understand. I’m not fond of pharmaceuticals, if I’m honest. It’s… a personal preference. Is that… is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, I appreciate your... philosophical approach to healthcare, but it's hindering the assessment. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I specifically avoid them. As I said, I prefer to… manage things naturally. I take vitamins, a multivitamin mostly, but that's all. Not a prescription medicine, not an over-the-counter drug, nothing. I really don't like putting things into my body, if I can help it. It's probably silly, but... that's how I feel.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with abdominal palpation.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. If you… if you don’t mind, Doctor, would you mind telling me what exactly you’re looking for? I… I get rather anxious during medical examinations. It’s… a bit silly, I know, but… I would appreciate knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, the purpose of a physical exam is to gather objective data. I will be palpating your abdomen to assess for any tenderness, masses, or organomegaly. It involves me gently pressing on your abdomen. It is not a particularly invasive procedure. Please relax, and try not to tense your muscles. It will make the examination more difficult.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall attempt to relax, as you suggest. Though, I must warn you, I have a rather sensitive stomach. I get easily… flustered, you see. And I do tend to tense my muscles when I'm anxious. Please… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me if you feel any discomfort as I press here. Any pain at all?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little bit, yes. Just… a slight pressure. It’s not… excruciating, but it’s… noticeable. It feels rather… tender. Is that… is that normal? Perhaps it’s just my imagination. I do tend to be rather sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Tenderness upon palpation in the lower quadrants, more pronounced on the left side. And here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… definitely more tender there. It’s… a sharp pressure, almost. It's not a pain that radiates, it's... localized. I feel rather… uncomfortable, Doctor. Is something wrong? It feels… different than before.
DOCTOR: I am detecting some suprapubic tenderness. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’m… I’m trying to remain calm, as you suggested. Though I must confess, I’m starting to feel rather… anxious. This is… unsettling. I hope you’re not detecting anything… serious.
DOCTOR: Bowel sounds are present, but somewhat… diminished. Ms. MacVittie, given your frequent urination, suprapubic tenderness, and diminished bowel sounds, I am concerned about the possibility of a urinary tract infection, or potentially a more serious condition. We need to run some tests. I'm going to order a urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. We may also need to consider imaging if the symptoms persist. I would recommend a pelvic ultrasound. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: A… a urinary tract infection? Or something… more serious? Oh dear. Contrast dye…? I… I don’t believe so. No, I haven’t had any experience with… with contrast dye. I’ve rarely been to the doctor, as you know. A pelvic ultrasound… that sounds… rather invasive. What… what exactly does it involve, Doctor? And what are the chances… what are the chances it’s nothing serious?
DOCTOR: A pelvic ultrasound involves a transducer being moved over your lower abdomen to create images of your bladder and reproductive organs. It is non-invasive, Ms. MacVittie, although it may be slightly uncomfortable. As for the chances of it being "nothing serious," it is impossible to say without the test results. However, given your symptoms, we must rule out a potential infection, kidney stones, or other underlying causes. I will also have my assistant draw blood for the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. We need to gather as much information as possible. I understand your anxieties, but delaying diagnosis could have adverse consequences. I'll have the assistant come in to draw your blood now. Would you like me to step out while that is happening?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Kidney stones… No, thank you, Doctor. I… I think I would prefer you remain. I… I get rather flustered easily, you see. And I… I don't like being alone when I’m feeling anxious. Perhaps… perhaps you could explain the procedure to me in more detail? Just… to calm my nerves, you understand. What exactly will the assistant be doing, and how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant, Sarah, will be inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to draw a sample of blood. The process typically takes five to ten minutes. You may feel a slight pinch, but it is generally not painful. The blood sample will be sent to the lab for analysis, which will provide information about your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and overall health. As for the ultrasound, Sarah will apply a gel to your abdomen and move the transducer over your lower abdomen. Again, it is non-invasive, and we will be able to visualize your bladder and reproductive organs on the screen. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. A small needle… and gel on my abdomen. It sounds… unpleasant, but I suppose it’s necessary. Will the results be available… quickly? I… I’m rather anxious about waiting. And… and what if something is wrong? What are the next steps if the tests reveal a… a serious condition?
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to return. I will review them as soon as they are available and contact you immediately to discuss the findings. If the tests reveal a serious condition, we will discuss the appropriate treatment options, which may include medication, further imaging, or referral to a specialist. Depending on the severity of the condition, hospitalization may be necessary. However, Ms. MacVittie, it is important not to jump to conclusions. We do not know anything for certain yet. Let's focus on getting the tests done first, and we will address any concerns as they arise. I’ll have Sarah come in now to draw your blood. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please… please be gentle. And… and let me know as soon as you have the results, no matter the time. I… I would prefer to know, even if it’s… unsettling. .
