DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now! Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go, and they’re quite persistent when they do come. It's a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of hiccups. I understand that can be quite bothersome. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe them a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm, describe them… well, they feel like normal hiccups, I suppose. You know, that little jerk of the chest, and then you gasp. Sometimes just the one, sometimes a little burst of three or four in a row. Nothing painful, just… annoying. And they don't seem to be connected to anything specific. I haven't been eating too fast, or getting excited, or anything like that. Just… hic there they are again! See?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And thank you for demonstrating. It’s helpful to see. You mentioned they don't seem connected to any specific triggers like eating quickly or getting excited. That's good information. Have you noticed if anything does make them worse, or perhaps a little better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… worse? Not really, no. I tried holding my breath, like my mother always told me to do, but that didn't do a thing. Better… well, sometimes if I’m really concentrating on something, like my crossword puzzle, I forget about them for a bit. But as soon as I stop, hic, they come back. Drinking water doesn't seem to help either, surprisingly. I usually can stop them with a good swig of water. But not these ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, holding your breath and drinking water haven't been effective this time. And focusing on a distraction like your crossword puzzle offers temporary relief. Let's go through a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, dear. Go right ahead. Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no tummy troubles, no chest pain. I've been sleeping alright, though maybe a little restless because of the hic hiccups, of course. And my appetite is normal. Oh! Now that you mention it, I have felt a little bit… bloated, maybe? But I just thought it was the weather. We’ve had some humid days lately.
DOCTOR: Bloating is good to know. Humid weather can certainly contribute to that. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions. Have you had any significant changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always do. Lots of fruit, vegetables, some fish a couple of times a week. I do enjoy a little bit of chocolate now and then, but that’s been a habit for years! No new foods, no big changes in how much I’m eating… nothing like that. I haven't been traveling either, so it's not like I picked something up somewhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No dietary changes, no recent travel. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you're comfortable with that. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago now. No trouble with that since. And I’ve always had a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take a small dose every day. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think! I used to work as a psychiatric aide, you see, so I always made sure to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and well-controlled high blood pressure. That's helpful information. Could you please tell me what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it's Lisinopril, I think. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… goodness, probably ten years now. The doctor keeps a good record of everything, of course, but I try to remember these things. It hasn't bothered me at all, no side effects or anything like that. Just keeps the blood pressure nice and steady.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I was a pretty hardy child, and I guess that stuck. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. No trouble with bee stings, shellfish, pollen… nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… let me think. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father had some heart trouble. His brother had it too, so it seems to run in that side of the family. Nothing else that I can recall, really. My siblings are both healthy as can be, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother and heart trouble in your father and uncle. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, but I convinced him to quit years ago. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Just a small glass, mind you. Nothing heavy. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I always believed in a healthy lifestyle, even when I was working long hours.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sucich, for providing all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. This will help me rule out any obvious causes for your hiccups.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think is best. Sounds perfectly reasonable. I always trust a doctor who takes the time to listen and examine. Go right ahead. I hope I’m not too much trouble!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sucich. This is what I'm here for. If you could lie back for me, please. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. There is a little bit of bloating as you mentioned, but nothing concerning. No hepatosplenomegaly. Your neurological exam is normal, and I am not seeing any other obvious cause for the hiccups at this point.
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… good, I suppose. Although I wish you could find something! It's just these pesky hic hiccups are so bothersome. What does all that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I haven't been feeling unwell in any other way, so it’s just a bit worrying to have something that won't go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Sucich. The good news is that, based on the examination, there's no sign of anything acutely serious. Sometimes, hiccups can be idiopathic—meaning we don't know the exact cause. They can be triggered by a variety of things, and often they resolve on their own. Given your history and the lack of concerning findings on the examination, I suspect this is a benign case of prolonged hiccups. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I would like to order a few blood tests. This will include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. This will help to assess your overall health and ensure there isn't anything else contributing to the hiccups. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… well, alright if it will help. I don't like needles, mind you, but if you think it's best, I trust your judgment. I just want these hic hiccups to go away! What exactly will those tests show? And how long will it take to get the results? I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I’ve had enough of doctors over the years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Sucich, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. The tests will help rule out things like electrolyte imbalances, kidney problems, and thyroid issues—all of which can sometimes cause prolonged hiccups. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them with you and discuss the next steps. If the tests are normal, we can assume this is a benign case of idiopathic hiccups. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend continuing to try simple remedies like holding your breath, sipping water, and trying to distract yourself. We can also discuss a medication if the hiccups continue to be bothersome after we get the test results. There are a few medications that can help, but we usually reserve those for more severe cases. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Just having something done makes me feel a little better, honestly. Hold my breath, sip water, distract myself… I've been trying! It's just not working. Alright, let's get the blood tests done then. Where do I go? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do enjoy my breakfast, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You do not need to fast before the blood draw. You can have breakfast as usual. Please take this requisition form to the lab just down the hall, room 102. The lab technician will draw your blood, and the results will be sent directly to me. They will likely take less than ten minutes. Once you've had the blood drawn, you can go about your day as usual. I’ll call you as soon as the results are in, typically within 48 hours, to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… hic I hope everything is alright. Thank you, Doctor, for listening to me and taking the time to figure this out. It’s reassuring to know someone is looking into it. I’ll go and get this done now. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. That's what I'm here for. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And don't worry too much – we'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
