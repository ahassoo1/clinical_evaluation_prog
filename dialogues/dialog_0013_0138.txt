DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit of a worry, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been after me to come in. Seems I’ve been having… spells. Not often, but enough to make her nervous. And my… my husband’s side of the family, they had… problems with headaches, bad ones, and… weakness on one side. It’s all a bit muddled in my head, to be honest. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “spells” – can you tell me a little more about what those are like?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… It’s hard to explain. Sometimes, just for a little while, my arm feels… heavy. Like I can’t lift it properly. And my speech… it gets a little… slurred, I think my daughter said. It doesn’t last long, maybe ten, fifteen minutes, and then it’s gone. But it’s happened a couple of times now. And with the headaches… they aren’t always there, but when they come, they’re… fierce. Not like a regular headache, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. And how long have these spells been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky one. It feels like… a few months, maybe? But honestly, time slips away from me these days. My daughter says it’s been happening more frequently lately, which is why she insisted I come see you. I try not to worry, you see. I had a good life, a good marriage… I don’t want to focus on… on things going wrong.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you. So, a few months of these spells with the arm weakness and slurred speech, and headaches that aren't constant but are severe when they happen. Have you noticed anything that triggers these spells – anything that seems to bring them on?
PATIENT: Hmm... Now that's a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. It doesn't seem to be after exertion, or a certain food, or… well, anything really. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting and reading, other times when I’m doing something around the house. It's quite random, really. My daughter mentioned something about stress, but I don’t feel particularly stressed… not anymore, anyway. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, random occurrences. And you said your daughter mentioned a family history of headaches and weakness on one side?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. My husband, God rest his soul, his mother and her brother… they both suffered terribly with headaches. The kind that would keep them in bed for days. And I remember my daughter saying something about weakness… on their right side, I think? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t as… attentive to those things, you see. We didn't talk about health much back then. It was… considered a bit private.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the headaches and these spells, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my eyesight hasn't been the best lately. It's a little blurry, especially when I read. I just figured it was my age, you know? And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but not often. It's a fleeting thing, comes and goes quickly. Nothing I’ve ever bothered the doctor about before. I chalked it up to getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and occasional dizziness. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's another thing that's a bit fuzzy. I had… I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. And I think I had a touch of the flu a few winters back. But as for things like high blood pressure or… diabetes, I don't think so. The doctor used to check me regularly, when my husband was still alive, but… it was a long time ago. I haven’t really kept up with it since. I suppose I should have.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder surgery in the past, but no other major medical conditions diagnosed. And have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, dear, I don't think so. Nothing else comes to mind. Just the gallbladder, many years ago. I was quite young then, really. A simple operation, thankfully. Nothing like these things you hear about nowadays. I’ve always been fairly healthy, you see. Or I thought I was, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… just this. I take a little something for my arthritis, just to help with the aches and pains. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of these… a sleeping pill, but not every night, just when I’m really restless. That’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what are the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear... let me see... This one... it’s... naproxen, I think. For the arthritis. And this one... oh, it's a small bottle... temazepam. That's the one for sleeping. It's been a while since I refilled them, honestly. I usually just ask my daughter to pick them up when she goes to the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen and temazepam. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... no, dear, I don't think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I've never had any trouble with medications. My daughter always asks, of course, but I always tell her, "No, dear, no allergies." I've just always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit, and my husband… he didn’t care for it either. So, no, I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I always preferred a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner, now and then. Not every day, mind you. Just on special occasions, or when we have guests. My husband and I used to enjoy a glass of Chianti with our pasta. But I don’t drink much anymore. It doesn’t appeal to me as much since… well, since he’s been gone.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your living situation?
PATIENT: I live in the house my husband and I bought when we were first married. It’s a little big for just me now, but I love it. It’s full of memories, you see. My daughter lives nearby, thank goodness. She comes over most days to check on me and help with the cooking and cleaning. I try to stay active, but… I get tired easily. It's a comfortable life, really. Just… a little lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live at home with your daughter nearby. Now, to go back to your symptoms for a moment... you mentioned headaches, arm weakness, slurred speech, and blurry vision. Can you rate your headaches on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a tricky one. When they’re bad… I suppose… maybe a 7 or 8? They’re not constant, you see. It’s more of a throbbing pain, right behind my eyes. And sometimes it goes all the way down my neck. It’s quite debilitating when it happens. I have to lie down in a dark room and just… wait it out. But thankfully, they don’t last very long.
DOCTOR: Okay. And about the arm weakness – which arm is it, and is it weakness throughout the entire arm, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: It's… it’s my right arm, dear. And it’s… well, it’s the whole arm, really. It just feels heavy and… clumsy. Like I can’t lift it properly. Sometimes it feels numb too, a little tingling sensation. It's not painful, just… not right. And it comes and goes, you see. It doesn't happen all the time, just during those spells.
DOCTOR: Okay, right arm weakness during spells. And you said the slurred speech happens at the same time as the weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It all seems to happen together, really. The arm weakness, the slurred speech… and sometimes a little dizziness. It’s all very unsettling, you see. I try not to think about it too much, but… it’s hard not to worry. My daughter says I should get it checked out, and I suppose she's right. I just hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice deep breath for me… and another one… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Can you squeeze my hands as tight as you can?
PATIENT: Is that alright? I don't want to be too forceful. It's a little hard to squeeze as tightly as I used to.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Alayne. Just do what's comfortable. Okay, and now the other hand. Good. Now, let's check your legs. Can you push your feet against my hands like this?
PATIENT: It feels… a little harder on this side. Not painful, just… not as strong, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. I notice some mild weakness on your right side as well. And now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your coordination and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Is that alright? My eyes get tired easily, you see. It's hard to keep them focused for very long.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, just do your best. Good. And now, I'm going to ask you to touch your nose with your finger, then touch my finger, then repeat.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m not very good at this, am I? It feels a little awkward.
DOCTOR: That's okay, it's just a quick assessment. Now, one last thing. I'm going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me. Just walk normally, and let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Oh dear… it feels a little… off balance. I have to concentrate to keep my feet moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne. Thank you. I noticed some mild weakness on your right side, some difficulty with coordination, and a slight drag when you walk. Your blood pressure is a little elevated as well. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, I'm concerned about a possible neurological issue. It’s too early to say for certain what's going on, but we need to investigate further. I want to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural problems, and I'd also like to order some blood work to check your overall health. And I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a neurologist… oh dear. It sounds… serious. But… yes, yes, that sounds alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t want to just sit here and worry. But a neurologist… will that be expensive? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable questions, Alayne. Let’s address those one at a time. The CT scan is covered by your insurance, but there may be a co-pay depending on your plan, which you can check with your insurance provider. As for the neurologist, I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, who is excellent and accepts your insurance. I’ll make sure the referral includes all my findings from today, and the office will work with you to schedule an appointment. It typically takes a few days to a week to get the results back from the CT scan. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the neurologist's recommendations at that time. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any new symptoms – like sudden severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking – go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A neurologist, a CT scan... avoiding strenuous activity... yes, yes, that sounds manageable. I'll be careful, Doctor. I'll listen to everything you've said. And I'll call my daughter, she'll want to know all this. And... thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, just knowing what we're going to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. I’m glad I could help. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us once we have the CT scan results. Here's a printed summary of our discussion today, including the referral information and instructions. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and remember, we’re here to help you through this. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think I'll call my daughter now. She'll want to drive me home. Goodbye.
