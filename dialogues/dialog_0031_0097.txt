DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must say, finding a doctor who understands the importance of… proper education is becoming increasingly difficult. But never mind that. I am here because my husband, bless his heart, thinks I need to fill out some… form. An “Advance Directive,” he called it. Or a “POLST” form. Honestly, the man worries too much. But he insists, and a peaceful marriage is… advantageous. So, here I am. Do you handle these sorts of things?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, I do. It’s very responsible of both of you to be thinking about these matters. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both important tools for ensuring your wishes are respected should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. It sounds like your husband is very thoughtful. To clarify, are you primarily here today to complete these forms with my guidance, or are you experiencing any health concerns that prompted this discussion now?
PATIENT: Well, "thoughtful" is… a generous description of his tendency to overreact. But yes, completing the forms is the objective. I assure you, my health is perfectly… adequate. I maintain a rigorous routine, both mental and physical. No, no current concerns. It’s simply… preventative. Though I confess, I haven’t the faintest idea what needs to be written on these documents. My husband said something about “end-of-life decisions,” which is rather… dramatic, wouldn’t you agree? Is this a long process? I have a luncheon scheduled for one o'clock.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s quite common to feel overwhelmed by these documents. “End-of-life decisions” can sound daunting, but it really just means thoughtfully considering what’s important to you regarding your medical care should you become seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself. We can certainly work through this efficiently. It shouldn't take excessively long, especially if you’re currently feeling well. Before we begin, perhaps we could briefly review your medical history just to have a complete picture?
PATIENT: Medical history. Honestly. I suppose. Though I assure you, it will be… unremarkable. I have always been quite diligent about maintaining my health. No chronic illnesses, no… difficult procedures. Just the usual childhood ailments, decades ago. I did have a rather unpleasant bout of food poisoning in Marrakech a few years back, but that was entirely due to a questionable street vendor. And a broken wrist skiing, but that was… a long time ago. I see no need to bore you with the details. Is it absolutely necessary to list every childhood cold? Perhaps we could focus on the Advance Directive itself?
DOCTOR: You’re right, we don't need to delve into every childhood illness. It's more important to understand any significant past medical issues, surgeries, or hospitalizations. Knowing about the food poisoning in Marrakech is helpful, as it gives me a sense of your body’s response to illness. And the broken wrist is good to note as well. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. High blood pressure? The very idea! I maintain a very… controlled lifestyle. Diabetes? I am exceedingly careful about my diet. And heart disease? Unthinkable. My father lived to be ninety-five, perfectly healthy until the very end. It’s a matter of genetics, you see. And discipline. Really, Doctor, I assure you, my medical history is… quite pristine. Are we getting anywhere with this Advance Directive, or are we simply discussing my exemplary health? I do have that luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, I understand. It sounds like you've been very proactive about your health. That’s excellent. Let’s move on to the Advance Directive then. Essentially, this document allows you to name someone – a healthcare proxy – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Would you like to discuss who you would consider for that role?
PATIENT: Well, naturally, it would be my husband. Though he can be… rather insistent, as I mentioned. And prone to panic. But he is, after all, my husband. He handles the finances, and I suppose he can handle… medical decisions as well. Though I will need to be very specific about my preferences. I do not want any… unnecessary interventions. I have seen what happens in hospitals. It’s… undignified. And certainly no prolonged… artificial support. Is there a form I can simply sign that says “No prolonged artificial support?” That would be most efficient.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Chilla. It's very common to have specific wishes regarding end-of-life care, and we can certainly document those clearly in the Advance Directive. There isn’t a single form that says exactly “No prolonged artificial support,” but we will use specific language to outline your preferences regarding things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and resuscitation. To ensure we capture everything accurately, could you tell me a little more about what "unnecessary interventions" mean to you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I simply do not want to be kept alive artificially if there is no reasonable hope of recovery. No machines breathing for me, no tubes feeding me, no… desperate measures that prolong suffering. I have lived a full life, a cultured life, and I would prefer a peaceful end, with dignity. I do not want to be a burden on my family, or… a science experiment. Is that clear enough? Must we dissect every minute detail? I assure you, I am quite rational. I simply want my wishes respected. And I would prefer to avoid any… prolonged hospital stays. They are… ghastly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, that is very clear. You want to prioritize a peaceful, dignified end of life, with no artificial prolongation of suffering, and you wish to avoid prolonged hospital stays if possible. We will document all of that in detail. Now, the POLST form, which your husband mentioned, is a bit different. It's a medical order that specifies current medical wishes, and it's typically completed when someone has a serious illness or frailty. It’s more concrete than the Advance Directive, and it's something healthcare providers would follow immediately. Since you are currently in good health, we don’t necessarily need to complete that form today. But we can certainly discuss it for future reference. Do you have any questions about the difference between the Advance Directive and the POLST form?
PATIENT: So, the POLST form is… unnecessary? Good. That simplifies matters considerably. I confess, the very thought of a "medical order" specifying my wishes… it feels rather… presumptuous. And intrusive. I prefer to maintain control, thank you very much. So, we are focusing solely on the Advance Directive then? And you will document my wishes regarding… no artificial prolongation, peaceful end, and the avoidance of… ghastly hospital stays? Is that correct? And will this document be easily accessible to my husband, should the need arise? He does have a tendency to… overreact, you see. I need to be certain he will understand and respect my wishes.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, that is correct. We are focusing solely on the Advance Directive today. I will document your wishes regarding no artificial prolongation of life, a peaceful end of life, and avoidance of prolonged hospital stays. And yes, the document will be easily accessible to your husband. It will be included in your medical record, and we can also provide you with a copy to keep at home and share with him. We can also discuss how to best communicate your wishes to other family members or healthcare providers if needed. To finalize the document, we just need to identify a secondary healthcare proxy – someone who can make decisions on your behalf if your husband is unavailable. Have you thought about who that might be?
PATIENT: A secondary proxy… Hmm. My sister, perhaps. Though she is… rather opinionated. And prone to unsolicited advice. But she is… family. Yes, my sister, Fatima. She lives in Casablanca, but she is… resourceful. She can be contacted via email, I believe. Though I haven’t spoken to her in… some time. She will need very clear instructions. Regarding my wishes, of course. Do you have a form for that? A list of “Do Not Do” items? That would be most efficient.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, we can certainly include Fatima as your secondary healthcare proxy. We'll need her contact information, and I'll document that in the form. And yes, we can create a list of "Do Not Do" items – your specific wishes regarding treatments you would like to avoid. To be precise, are there any specific treatments you definitely do not want, regardless of the situation?
PATIENT: Absolutely. No intubation. Under no circumstances. I have seen the… aftermath. It's barbaric. No feeding tubes, either. I prefer to maintain my… dignity. And no resuscitation if my heart simply… stops. I have lived a full life, Doctor. I do not wish to be… jolted back to life against my will. And no… experimental treatments. I am not a science project. Is that clear enough? I want this document to be absolutely unequivocal. And I want my husband to understand. He sometimes… misinterprets things. Perhaps a simplified version for him? A "Husband-Friendly" Advance Directive?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, perfectly clear. No intubation, no feeding tubes, no resuscitation, and no experimental treatments. We will document all of that very specifically in the Advance Directive. And yes, we can certainly create a simplified version for your husband, outlining your key wishes in plain language. We often do that to ensure everyone is on the same page. Okay, so to finalize the Advance Directive, we just need Fatima’s contact information and your signature. Once that's complete, you’ll have a copy for your records, and we’ll ensure it’s accessible to your husband and other healthcare providers. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. As long as you've documented my wishes precisely, and created a "Husband-Friendly" version, I think we're all set. I do appreciate your patience. It's not easy explaining these things to… less educated individuals. And please, assure my husband that this is a very important document. He tends to… dismiss things unless they are explicitly stated. And perhaps a brightly colored folder for it? It would be more… noticeable. And do you have a pen? A nice one, preferably.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. I have documented all of your wishes carefully, and I’m happy to provide you with this bright red folder for safekeeping. And yes, here is a lovely pen for you to use. If you would please review the document one last time to ensure everything is accurate, and then sign at the bottom, we will have everything finalized. And rest assured, I’m happy to explain anything further to your husband if he has any questions. Take your time, Ms. Chilla.
PATIENT: There. Done. It is… quite a long document, isn’t it? But necessary, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… adequate. And please, send a copy of the "Husband-Friendly" version to my email address. It’s marijachilla@email.com. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon to attend. It involves a rather discerning group of… patrons. And I mustn’t be late. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. I will email the simplified version to marijachilla@email.com immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a lovely luncheon. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. And thank you for allowing me to assist you.
