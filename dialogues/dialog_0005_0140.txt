DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day. It's… something with my mouth. A bit embarrassing, really. It’s white, and it’s not… pleasant. I’d rather not dwell on the details, if we could just get it sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. “Something with your mouth.” Well, I need something to work with, sir. “White and unpleasant” doesn’t exactly narrow it down. Is it painful?
PATIENT: No, not painful, exactly. More… irritating. And it’s hard to eat, sometimes. Especially anything sweet. Look, is this going to take long? My wife is expecting me home. It’s just… a coating, a film. It doesn’t look serious, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, “irritating, hard to eat sweets, coating.” Still not much, but we’re getting somewhere. Has this been happening long?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know… a week, maybe? Perhaps a little longer. I didn’t think much of it at first. It just… appeared. I assumed it would go away on its own. I don’t usually bother doctors for minor things. Valuable time, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, assuming things “go away on their own” isn’t always the best course of action, Mr. Schieber. It's good you came in now, instead of waiting for it to worsen. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No. I told you, it's just the white stuff. And the difficulty eating sweet things. I haven’t felt unwell, no fever, no… anything else. Honestly, I think it’s probably just something I ate. A bad mango, perhaps? I don’t understand why we need to go into such detail.
DOCTOR: Because, sir, “something you ate” can cause a multitude of problems. I need a complete picture to determine what’s going on. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No. I haven’t been sick. I rarely get sick. I’m a… a healthy man. I work hard, I eat reasonably well, I don’t spend my time lounging around getting ill. Look, Doctor, with all due respect, are we getting anywhere with this, or should I just go home and try some mouthwash? I really don’t have time for a lengthy investigation over a bit of white coating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Let’s just get this over with. I’m going to take a look. Open wide. And try to be patient. It's faster if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Finally. Just get it done, please.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. As I suspected. There’s a whitish coating on your tongue and the buccal mucosa. It’s easily scraped off… …and there’s some underlying redness. No obvious lesions, thankfully. It looks like a mild case of oral thrush, likely caused by a fungal infection. Not a serious condition, but irritating, as you’ve pointed out.
PATIENT: Thrush? What causes that? And what do I need to do about it? I haven't got time for a lecture on fungi, Doctor. Just tell me what medication I need. Quickly.
DOCTOR: It’s often a sign of a weakened immune system, though it can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Sometimes it’s a side effect of certain medications, or even just a disruption in the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth. But we won't dwell on the why right now. I’m going to prescribe you a mouthwash, Nystatin. Swish with it three times a day for two weeks. And you must finish the entire course, even if it seems better. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Nystatin… three times a day. Two weeks. Fine. And how much will that cost? I need to get home, you know. My wife…
DOCTOR: That depends on the pharmacy. Unfortunately, you're uninsured, so you'll have to pay out of pocket. It shouldn't be exorbitant, but I can't give you an exact price. I can write the prescription, and you can call around to compare costs. Now, if it doesn’t improve within a week, or if it gets worse, you need to come back immediately. And try to improve your oral hygiene – brush and floss regularly. Any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. Though, frankly, I think common sense and a good mouthwash would have sufficed. .
DOCTOR: Some people… Honestly. .
