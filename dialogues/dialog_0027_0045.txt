DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I keep getting…flushing. Like, my face gets really red. And sometimes my neck too. It’s been happening for, oh, maybe a month now? Not every day, but enough to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing for about a month. That’s helpful. And it's not constant, just comes and goes. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. And not really after…exercise, I don’t do much of that these days. Sometimes when I’m talking to people, maybe? But not always. It just…happens. It's very strange. I don't feel hot when it happens, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem consistently tied to food or activity…and it’s not accompanied by fever or feeling overheated. Sometimes with conversation, sometimes…just happens. Right. And how would you rate the intensity of the flushing?
PATIENT: Intensity… hmm. It’s not… terrible. Not painful, not like a sunburn. Just… noticeable. People look at me funny, I think. Maybe a 6 or 7, on a scale of 10? If 10 is super red and awful, it's not that bad. It fades pretty quickly, usually within a few minutes. It’s just… embarrassing, really. And worrying, because I don’t know why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6 or 7 out of 10, fades quickly. Embarrassing and concerning, I understand. Let's see... Have you noticed anything else happening with the flushing?
PATIENT: With the flushing… let me think. Sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little faster. Not racing, just… aware of it more. And maybe a little bit…sweaty? Just my face, though. Not like a full sweat. And, oh! Sometimes my hands feel a little shaky. But not always with the flushing. It’s all very mixed up, I guess. I wish I could tell you more clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased heart awareness, some facial sweating, and occasional shaky hands. That is a bit mixed up, but that’s alright. We'll try to sort it out. Now, have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Haven’t needed to, thankfully. Not since… well, not for a long time. Doctor gave me something for my… nerves, a few years back, but I stopped taking that. It didn't really help, and I didn't want to be on pills if I didn't need them. Just vitamins, sometimes. That's it.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, vitamins occasionally, stopped a nerve medication a few years ago. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that in… a long, long time. I don't think I’m allergic to anything, honestly. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach! But… she’s gone now, so I don't remember exactly. Sorry, that’s sad. It’s been a few years.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Withycombe. It's alright to remember. No known allergies, that’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. Never needed them. Um… I had pneumonia when I was a young man, a long time ago. But I recovered fully. And… high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. But it wasn't too bad. He said to watch my salt, and I did. I think it got better on its own. I haven't been to a doctor in… a while, until today. That’s why I don’t know for sure. I'm a bit of a stubborn one, I suppose. Don't like going to doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past, and a history of high blood pressure that appears to be managed with diet. And you haven't seen a doctor regularly recently. Alright. Now, do you have any family history of… heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart trouble when he got older. He had to have… a machine put in his chest, I think. A pacemaker, that’s it. And my mother had high blood pressure, too. She was always worried about it. And my sister… she had a lot of anxiety. She was always getting worked up, and I think that caused her problems with her heart, too. But that was a long time ago. I don’t know if any of that is important. I’m not very good at remembering family history, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and anxiety in your sister. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn't like it, and I didn't want to upset her. She was very… particular about her health. I used to smoke when I was a teenager, a few cigarettes, but I stopped a long time ago. I don’t like the smell of it. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol. That's good. Now, how would you describe your stress levels?
PATIENT: Stress… well, that’s a hard one. It’s been a little higher lately, I suppose. Since my wife… passed. It's quiet now. Too quiet. I used to worry a lot about things, even before. Just… a worrier, I guess. Trying to take it easy, but it's not always easy. I spend a lot of time alone now, which isn't good, I think. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately either. It just doesn't feel the same.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it's natural to feel stressed and anxious. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure and heart rate, and just listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m not a fan of doctors, but I trust you. Just… be quick, if you could. It makes me a little nervous, all this poking and prodding. But I want to know what’s going on, so do what you need to. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Not alarmingly high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Your heart rate is 88 and regular. I hear a normal heart rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs sound clear, good air entry on both sides. No swelling or tenderness in your neck. Everything seems within normal limits, physically. Your skin is warm and dry. I noticed some redness on your face and neck, consistent with your description of the flushing.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. So what does it mean? Why am I getting this flushing? Is it my heart? My blood pressure? I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it. I don't want to worry about it all the time. It's just… unsettling, you know? I feel like something is wrong, even if you say it isn’t.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the flushing, Mr. Withycombe. There are several possibilities. It could be related to your blood pressure, but it doesn’t sound severe enough to be the sole cause. Sometimes flushing can be a sign of anxiety or stress, which you’ve mentioned experiencing. It can also be caused by a number of other things, less common, but worth considering. To rule out anything serious, I would like to order some blood tests. We'll check your thyroid function, your complete blood count, and some basic electrolytes. I’d also like to do an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and that… EKG thing. Yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best. I don’t like going to the hospital, but I want to know what’s going on. So, yes, do the tests. But please, tell me what everything means, okay? I don’t understand all the medical talk. Just… explain it to me like I’m a regular person. And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything in plain language, Mr. Withycombe. No medical jargon, I promise. The blood tests and EKG will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results, so let's say about three to five business days. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Are there any questions you have for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for not making me feel like I’m crazy. And for explaining things. I appreciate that. Three to five days… I can wait. I just hope it's nothing serious. It's just… a lot to worry about. But I’ll wait for the results. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. It was nice meeting you.
