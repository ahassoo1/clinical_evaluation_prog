DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s this… tingling. In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just… annoying, you know? I’m Teretha, by the way. Uzarski.
DOCTOR: Yes, Teretha, nice to meet you as well. Annoying tingling, okay. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad. And it comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, others it’s… well, noticeable. Mostly in the mornings, I think. And it’s both hands and both feet, pretty much the same. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Teretha. No need to apologize, you’re doing great. So, mornings are worst, and it's in both hands and both feet... about how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? At first, I didn’t pay much attention to it, just thought I was getting old, you know? But it hasn’t gone away. And it seems to be… getting a little more frequent, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. I haven’t really tried to keep track. Just hoping it wasn't anything serious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradually increasing in frequency. That's helpful. And you said it's not painful, just tingling... Does anything specifically make it worse – certain activities, positions, or times of day beyond the mornings?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t know if anything makes it worse, exactly. But it feels a bit more bothersome when it’s cold. Like, if I'm doing the dishes and the water is cold, it’s worse then. Or if I’m out in the garden on a chilly day. Not a lot worse, just… more noticeable, I suppose. And sitting for too long maybe? I do a lot of driving for work, you know, being a mail carrier, and sometimes my hands get a bit numb after a long route. Though, that could just be the steering wheel.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold temperatures and prolonged sitting seem to be factors. And you’re a mail carrier, so you do quite a bit of driving. Let’s talk a little more broadly – have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not really. I can still do everything I need to. I can still carry the mail, still garden, still cook… I haven’t dropped anything or stumbled or anything like that. It just… feels strange, you know? Like my hands aren’t quite right. But I haven’t lost any strength, if that makes sense. I get worried about my job, though. I need to be able to do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weakness noted, which is good. "Not quite right" is a useful description, thank you. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… not that I know of. The doctor I used to see retired a few years back, and I haven't really gotten around to finding a new one. I try to eat healthy, mostly, and I walk a lot with my job. I haven’t been told I have anything… serious. My husband… he passed away a few years back, and he took care of all the doctor’s appointments. I’m probably not very good at remembering all this. I don’t take any regular medications, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Teretha. It’s helpful to know you haven’t been officially diagnosed with any medical conditions and aren’t taking any medications. We’ll get to the bottom of things. And I appreciate you sharing about your husband – that must have been difficult. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was a teenager. Fell out of a tree. Other than that… no, nothing really. No major surgeries, no hospital stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know? I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. At least, I used to be. This tingling is just… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm. Good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a bad reaction to any food. And I don't have any allergies to… plants or animals, nothing like that. I used to have a cat, a long time ago, and I was fine. So, no allergies, I don’t think. Are we getting close to figuring out what’s wrong with me? I'd like to get back to work if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And I understand you're eager to get back to work – we’ll do our best to figure this out. Now, sometimes tingling can be related to family history. Do you know if anyone else in your family has experienced anything similar – tingling, numbness, weakness, nerve problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands when she got older, arthritis mostly. She used to complain about them being stiff and achy. But I don't remember her ever mentioning tingling or numbness, like I'm having. My father… he was a farmer, a strong man, never really got sick. I don’t think so, no. No one in my family that I know of had anything like this. We weren’t really a family that talked about our health a lot. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had arthritis, but no similar nerve symptoms. That's helpful to know. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’m just going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won't take long. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this figured out. I don't mind. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? I'm not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Teretha, no needles today. Just a gentle exam. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It's a bit hard for me. Old hands, you know. Everything's a bit stiff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Teretha. Both hands feel equal in strength. Now, I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this – it's a cotton ball. Just tell me when you can feel it. Can you feel this on your fingertips?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I think so. It's… faint. Very faint. It’s hard to tell. Is that right? It’s not very strong, you know. And it feels a bit… different on each hand. Some spots feel tingly even before you touch them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Reduced sensation and reports of tingling even before stimulation. Now, can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Alright, I’ve got my eyes closed. Go ahead. Don’t poke too hard!
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha. I’m going to gently touch different spots on your hands and feet with this. Tell me “yes” when you feel the touch, and “no” when you don’t. Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. No… No, I don't feel that one. Yes… Oh, wait, yes, I feel it now. It’s… hard to tell. It’s tingly already, you know? It feels different everywhere. No… No, I definitely don't feel that one. Yes…
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Teretha. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, there are a few possibilities. The reduced sensation and tingling, especially with the reports of it being worse in the cold and with prolonged sitting, suggests a possible peripheral neuropathy - which is a problem with the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. This can have a lot of different causes. It could be related to vitamin deficiencies, diabetes , or simply age-related changes. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and a few other things. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… alright. If that’s what you think is best. I don’t like needles, but I’ll do it if I have to. As long as it will help me figure out what’s wrong. And get back to my mail route. Yes, that’s fine. Just… tell me beforehand, alright? I get a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Teretha. I’ll explain everything beforehand, and we'll take it slow. We'll start with a simple blood draw, and the lab technician will be very gentle. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend that you try to keep your hands and feet warm, especially when you’re outside or doing the dishes. And if you can, try to avoid prolonged sitting. Small breaks to move around can help. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… how long will the tests take? And when will I get the results? I just want to know if it’s something serious, you know? Is it going to stop me from doing my job? That’s the biggest worry. I don't want to lose my route.
