DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I need to get a card... a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. I want to keep working, you see, and I understand I need this to be legal. It's all very new to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're referring to a medical examiner’s certificate, often called a DOT physical, required for commercial drivers, which now includes ride-sharing drivers in many jurisdictions. We can certainly get that taken care of for you today. To begin, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, "DOT physical," that’s right! My grandson explained it. Overall health... well, I’m seventy, so things aren't perfect. But I feel pretty good, honestly. I still work out in the garden most days, and I can lift pretty heavy things for a little old lady. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, and I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t slow me down much. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active. Ten years ago for the gallbladder removal – do you recall any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: No, none at all. It was quick, and I recovered very well. I was back to gardening in a few weeks, maybe a month. Doctor did a good job, I remember. He’s retired now, though. I don’t even remember his name anymore, unfortunately. Old age… it’s a terrible thing. But the surgery itself? Perfect. No problems.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. No complications are always a good sign. And it's quite alright not to remember every detail – that's perfectly normal. Now, regarding your arthritis in your knees, do you take any medications for that, or do you use any assistive devices like a cane or brace?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter pain relievers when they really bother me. Mostly ibuprofen. I don't like taking too many pills, so I just push through it. No cane, no brace. I’m stubborn, I suppose. And I try to pace myself. I can’t work as hard as I used to, but I still manage. It's mostly just a little stiff in the mornings, and after a long day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think... High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed a few years ago. I take a pill for that… lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… oh, the doctor said something about my cholesterol being a little high, too, but he said it wasn't bad enough to need medication yet. Just told me to watch my diet. I try to, but I do love my sweets.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're aware of those things and trying to manage them. Lisinopril for the blood pressure – do you know your typical blood pressure readings, or approximately what range they’ve been in lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I leave all that to the doctor. I just take the pill he gives me! I think he said it was usually around 130 over 80, maybe? But I honestly don't pay much attention to the numbers. I just trust that if it was bad, he'd tell me. I don’t have a machine at home or anything. I go to the doctor for check-ups regularly, though. Every six months, usually.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. It’s good you have regular check-ups. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me my whole life! My mother always said I had an iron stomach. No reactions to any medicines, either. Never had anything like that happen. I'm very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Now, before we proceed with the physical examination, could you briefly tell me about any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mother had heart trouble when she got older, I believe. And my father... he had diabetes, I think. But he didn't take care of himself very well. Didn't eat right, didn't exercise. I try to be better than that. And my brother... he had high blood pressure, just like me, I think. Nothing too serious, though, as far as I know. It’s a bit of a blur, honestly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, unfortunately, but I always made him go outside. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs! I’m a very law-abiding citizen.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mrs. Sciarotta. Now, to proceed with the DOT physical, I’m going to need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your vision and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I just hope I pass! I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. I always get a little nervous when they take my blood pressure. It probably goes up just knowing they’re going to take it!
DOCTOR: It’s quite common to experience that. We'll take a few readings to get a good average. Just breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88 on your right arm and 140 over 86 on your left arm. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Your respiration is 16 and unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay. I haven’t had any trouble breathing, Doctor. And my heart feels fine, usually. Sometimes it skips a beat, but that happens to everyone, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles. That occasional skipped beat you mention – is it associated with any palpitations, dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just a little flutter sometimes. Happens maybe once a month, if that. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. It doesn’t bother me, really. It’s just… there. I’ve never had it checked out, to be honest. Never seemed serious enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your vision. Could you please read this eye chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Okay. Um... let me see… E, F, P, T, V… Okay, I can read down to… this line. Is that good enough? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know. I need reading glasses for close-up work.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. Many people need reading glasses as they get older. Your distance vision is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/30 in your left eye, with correction. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Oh dear, I always get nervous when they hit your knees! Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt, Mrs. Sciarotta. It’s just a gentle tap to see how your nerves are responding. It might be a little surprising, but not painful. Good. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s just do a quick range of motion check of your joints. Can you bend your elbows and knees for me?
PATIENT: Okay. There’s a little bit of a creak, but it’s just my arthritis. It’s worse in the mornings, you know. Not too bad, though, considering my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good. It sounds like you’re managing your arthritis well. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history to complete the DOT physical form. Have you ever had any issues with dizziness, fainting, seizures, or loss of consciousness?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single episode of dizziness, fainting, or anything like that. I’ve always had good balance, thankfully. Even now, I can walk without any trouble.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any heart attacks, strokes, or other serious cardiovascular issues?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My mother had some heart trouble later in life, but I've been lucky so far. Doctor always said my blood pressure was the only thing to watch, and I take my pills, so… I’m doing okay.
DOCTOR: And finally, have you ever had any neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or any other conditions that might affect your ability to safely operate a vehicle?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all like that. My mind is still pretty sharp, I think. I do crossword puzzles to keep it active. And I remember things just fine. Well, mostly. Old age, you know… but nothing serious enough to affect my driving.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta, based on my examination today and your responses to my questions, I am able to certify you as medically fit to drive commercially, including ride-sharing. Congratulations! However, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure and seeing your primary care physician regularly. It’s also a good idea to continue those crossword puzzles to keep your mind sharp. I will submit this form electronically to the appropriate authorities. You should receive confirmation within a few weeks. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you so much! No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. It’s a relief to know I can keep working. And thank you for being so kind!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Sciarotta. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and drive safely!
