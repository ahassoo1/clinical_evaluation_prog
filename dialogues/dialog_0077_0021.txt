DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's my foot, see? It’s been swelling up, especially my ankle. It started a few days ago, maybe four? It's not painful painful, just…big. And kinda warm, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, swelling in the ankle for approximately four days, with some warmth… not significantly painful, you say?
PATIENT: That's right. Not like a broken bone pain, you know? More like… when you wear shoes that are too tight all day. It's mostly just bothersome. Makes it hard to get my work boots on. I'm a loan interviewer, gotta be on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you said it’s been difficult getting your work boots on… Has the swelling been constant, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: It’s worse at the end of the day, definitely. When I get home from work, it's really puffed up. If I sit and put my feet up for a bit, it goes down some. Not all the way, though. It never really goes back to normal, you know? It's always a little bigger than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's exacerbated by activity and improves with rest… but doesn't fully resolve. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin around the ankle, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling. Color… hmm. I haven't really looked, to be honest. Let me see… It looks… maybe a little redder than usual? But I’m not good at that kinda thing. I just know it’s bigger. And warmer.
DOCTOR: Alright, some redness noted. And has this happened before, Mr. Parascandola?
PATIENT: No, never like this. I've twisted it a bit over the years, working, but it never stayed swollen. Usually just a little ice and it’s fine. This is different. It just keeps getting bigger, even with resting it. It worries me a little. I gotta be able to walk to do my job, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely. We’ll certainly try to get to the bottom of this. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Not much, really. I haven't been to a doctor in…oh, a long time. Maybe ten years? Just for a check-up, nothing serious. I don't have any regular conditions, like diabetes or heart trouble. I don’t take any pills, either. I try to eat okay, mostly. Nothing fancy. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical history aside from an appendectomy. And no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or insect stings?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, pretty much. And bugs don't bother me too much, just a little itch. Nothing serious. I’m lucky that way, I guess. My sister’s allergic to everything, poor thing.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, before we proceed, I would like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had trouble with his knees when he got older. Arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago, I wasn’t really paying attention to doctor stuff then. Nobody died of anything fancy, if that makes sense. Just…old age. My aunt on my mother's side had some kinda swelling in her legs too, when she was older. But I don’t know what it was.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of hypertension and some arthritis in the family, and a possible history of leg swelling in an aunt… Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your ankle and foot, if that’s alright with you. It will help me to better understand what’s going on. I will need you to lie on your back for this.
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need. Just tell me if it’s gonna hurt. I don’t like pain, you know? I'm a sensitive guy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't be painful, just some light pressure. Okay, Mr. Parascandola, I’m just going to feel around your ankle. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore… I'm noting some warmth and mild tenderness to the touch on the outer side of your ankle. And there is some slight swelling present. Your range of motion is a bit limited, but not significantly so. I'm also checking your pulses… Good pulses in both feet, which is reassuring. And cap refill is normal.
PATIENT: Okay. It is a little sore when you press right there, on the outside. That’s where it feels the worst, I think. Glad to hear the pulses are good, though. I worry about circulation, you know? My cousin had some trouble with that a few years back. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, based on the examination and your history, it seems likely that you have a sprain or strain of the ankle. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but given the lack of significant pain, good pulses, and normal cap refill, it doesn’t appear to be anything acutely serious like a fracture or a blood clot. However, the persistent swelling warrants further investigation to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order an X-ray of your ankle to rule out any underlying bone injury. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray, huh? Never had one before. Is it gonna…hurt? And is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. I try to avoid the hospital if I can. It gets pricey real fast. What do you think the chances are it is something serious, like a broken bone?
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself doesn’t hurt at all, Mr. Parascandola. You’ll simply lie still while a machine takes a picture of your ankle. It’s very quick and painless. I understand your concern about the cost, and that's a valid point. We can discuss options for minimizing the expense. I will speak to the billing department and see what the cost will be upfront, and we can explore potential assistance programs if needed. As for the chances of it being a broken bone, it’s relatively low given your symptoms and the findings on the examination. However, it’s always best to rule it out completely, especially since the swelling has persisted for several days. It's a precaution to ensure we provide the correct treatment. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the X-ray?
PATIENT: Alright… if you think it’s the best thing to do, then go ahead. Just… please tell me how much it’s gonna cost before you do it, okay? I don’t want any surprises. And if it is broken, what happens then? Do I need a cast? I gotta get back to work, you know? I can't be laid up for weeks. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Parascandola. I will find out the exact cost of the X-ray immediately and let you know before proceeding. If the X-ray reveals a fracture, the treatment would depend on the severity and location of the break. A minor fracture might only require a walking boot or a brace, while a more significant fracture might require a cast or even surgery. I want to assure you that we will explore all available options to get you back on your feet as quickly as possible. I will step out now to speak with the radiology department and the billing office. Please remain here, and I will return shortly with more information.
