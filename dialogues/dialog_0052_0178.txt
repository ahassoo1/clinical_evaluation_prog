DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…Gerardo is fine. Look, I ain't got a whole lot of time, if you don’t mind. Been coughin’ up stuff for…well, a long time now. And tired. Real tired. Seems like I get a sinus thing every other month too.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Gerardo. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll get through this as efficiently as possible. “Coughing up stuff” – could you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's…phlegm, mostly. Greenish-yellow sometimes. Other times it's clear. It just… comes up. Especially in the mornings. And when I lay down at night, it feels like it’s drippin’ down the back of my throat. Makes it hard to sleep, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Gerardo. That’s helpful. And you mentioned tiredness – is this a new fatigue, or something you've been experiencing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been a while. Years, I guess. Gets worse when I’m sick with one of these sinus things. But even when I ain't sick, I just…don’t have the energy I used to. Used to be able to work all day, now I need naps. And I'm single, so there ain't nobody helpin' with things around the house either.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite debilitating to experience both the persistent cough and fatigue. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through some routine questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had a fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Not really a fever, no. Maybe a little warm sometimes when the cough gets real bad, but nothin’ I’d bother takin’ medicine for. And chills…not usually. Mostly just achy, like I got the flu, but without the high temperature.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any shortness of breath or wheezing with the cough?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Not that I’ve noticed. I get outta breath doin’ stuff, yeah, but I figured that was just gettin’ old. I work in food processing, it's…physical work. Could be that.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, given your occupation. Now, have you had any chest pain associated with the cough, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No chest pain. And my feet…swell a little sometimes, yeah. I figured it was the heat. August, you know? Hot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your medical history, do you have any chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been diagnosed with any of that. Just…this cough, and bein’ tired. I go to the dentist regular, but other than that… not much. My insurance is private, so I try not to go unless I have to.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ taken out. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. But that was…ages and ages ago. Don't remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone who has a history of lung problems, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: My mom…she had somethin' wrong with her lungs when she was old. Couldn’t breathe good near the end. But she smoked her whole life, so…figured it was that. Dad was fine, healthy as a horse 'til the day he died. No cancer in the family that I know of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Gerardo. And finally, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Not much. Just some ibuprofen now and then for the aches. And… sometimes I take a multi-vitamin, but I forget half the time. That’s about it. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gerardo. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, if you'll allow me, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Get it over with then. The sooner I can go, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Please take deep breaths in and out when I ask you to. Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale… another deep breath… and exhale. Now I’ll listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular. Now, could you open your mouth, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright.
DOCTOR: Your throat appears mildly inflamed, but no visible lesions. Now, let me take a look at your ears. Ears appear clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, and pulse is 88. Alright, Gerardo. Thank you for your cooperation. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and there is some mild inflammation in your throat. Based on what you've told me and the physical examination, it sounds like you may have a chronic bronchitis exacerbation, possibly with some underlying hypertension. However, to be certain, I would like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work…more time, more money… Look, Doc, I don't like goin' to the hospital. Is it really necessary? Can’t you just give me somethin’ for the cough? An antibiotic or somethin’? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Gerardo. It's not ideal to undergo more tests, and I appreciate you voicing them. However, an antibiotic without knowing the cause of the cough is not advisable, as it won’t be effective for all types of infections, and overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance. The X-ray will help rule out pneumonia or other serious lung conditions, and the blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health and identify any underlying issues contributing to your fatigue. Given your elevated blood pressure, it's also important to assess your cardiovascular health. While I can prescribe a medication to manage the cough symptoms, that would be treating the symptom, not the underlying cause. I want to provide you with the best possible care, and that involves gathering sufficient information to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan. If you're hesitant about going to the hospital, we could start with the blood work first, and based on those results, decide whether the X-ray is necessary. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you?
PATIENT: Blood work first… alright. That… I can do. But no promises on the X-ray, Doc. No promises. Where do I go for that? And how long’s it gonna take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Gerardo. That’s a very reasonable approach. You can have your blood work done at the lab just across the street – they’re open until 5 PM today. I’ll send the order electronically to them now. They will let you know when the results are available, typically within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have the results, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, to help alleviate your cough, I can prescribe a cough suppressant with dextromethorphan. It won't cure the problem, but it may provide some relief. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Cough suppressant sounds good. Anything to get some sleep. Just… make sure they don’t make me drowsy, I still gotta work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Gerardo. I’ll prescribe dextromethorphan 30mg, to be taken every 6-8 hours as needed for your cough. It has minimal sedative effects at the recommended dosage, but it's always best to start with a lower dose to see how you react. Here is the prescription. Please take it to the pharmacy of your choice. Do you have any other questions for me today, or is there anything else I can assist you with?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that’s it. Just… thanks, Doc. And I hope these tests don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gerardo. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do our best to expedite the results. If you have any questions or experience any worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
