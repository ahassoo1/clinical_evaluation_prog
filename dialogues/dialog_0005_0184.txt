DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, good to see you. Or, as good as can be, I suppose, when someone's coming to see a doctor. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about… this. <gestures vaguely at his stomach> It just ain't right, you know? Used to be strong, solid. Now… well, look at it. It's all… soft. And hangin'. It’s disgraceful. I want it fixed. Plain and simple. Don't need a whole lot of talkin', just fixin'.
DOCTOR: Right. “Fixin’,” you say. Okay. So, this softness… how long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Change? Boy, I notice things. Always have. But it’s been… oh, maybe five, six years now? Started after my wife passed, I reckon. Not that that has anything to do with it, mind you. Just… started. And it ain’t gettin’ better. It’s just… there. And I don't like it. I used to have a proper build, you see. A man needs to look strong. It's respect.
DOCTOR: Five or six years… alright. And has there been any pain associated with this change?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not pain, exactly. Just… discomfort. When I bend over, sometimes. And it feels… empty. Like there’s nothin’ in there anymore. Like a balloon that’s lost its air. Does that make sense? Probably not. You young doctors and your fancy words. I just want it… tighter. Like it used to be. Before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand you’re experiencing some discomfort and a change in your abdominal appearance. "Tighter," you said. Let's try to get a little more specific. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you’re askin’ about… things a man don’t talk about! Look, I didn’t come here to discuss my… toilet business. I came here to get this fixed! This hangin’ belly, this… this weakness! What does my… stool have to do with it? Are you even listenin’ to me? I’m a pile driver operator, not a… a baby! I need action, not questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, these questions are relevant. It’s not about being a “baby,” it’s about understanding the whole picture. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes indicate what's going on inside your abdomen, which is what you're concerned about, correct?
PATIENT: Correct! I’m concerned about this… this mess! But look, if you’re gonna start askin’ about things like… that, I'm gonna have to leave. I ain’t comfortable. I came to a doctor to get a physical problem solved, not… not a… an inspection. You understand? I’m a man of dignity. And this line of questionin’ is undignified. Just tell me if you can fix it or not. Yes or no. That’s all I need to know. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your discomfort. However, to determine if anything can be done, I need information. I can't simply "fix" something without knowing what's causing it. It sounds like you're experiencing some abdominal wall laxity, likely due to age and potentially weight loss. But there are many possibilities. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam to assess the situation. If you're unwilling to allow me to do that, I cannot offer any further assistance. I can give you a referral to another doctor if you prefer. It is your choice.
