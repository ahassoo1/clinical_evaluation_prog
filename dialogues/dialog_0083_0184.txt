DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day, you know. It's about… well, it's about this. It’s just… gone soft. Always been a strong man, pile driving and all, but now… not so much. Want to see if anything can be done about it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. We'll certainly try to be efficient. When you say “gone soft,” could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It's… flabby. Like a bag. Used to be hard as rock, you know? From the work. Now it wobbles when I walk. It's not a good look. Never been one for… softness. And the wife… she always liked a strong build. Before… well, you know. Just want it back to how it was. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Trendler. You're concerned about a loss of muscle mass and a change in your abdominal area. It sounds like you’ve noticed a decline in your physical strength and tone. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit about when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, it didn't happen overnight, you know. It was… after the wife passed. About five years ago now. Stopped eating proper. No appetite, really. And… less work. Started getting these aches in my back, couldn’t lift like I used to. So I stopped pile driving mostly. Just… easier. That's when it started, I reckon. Everything going downhill. Not much point in anything after that, truth be told. But I suppose I should try… something.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. Grief can have a significant impact on both appetite and motivation, and reduced physical activity can certainly contribute to muscle loss. It sounds like you've experienced a lot of change in the past five years. To help me get a complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not much else, really. Bit tired sometimes. Not like proper tired, just… sluggish. And my clothes feel tighter. Used to be a good size, now I'm having to loosen the belt. That's about it. No pains, no dizziness, nothing fancy. Just… old. Feeling old, you know? And a bit… round. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Trendler. The feeling of sluggishness and the change in your clothing size are relevant. Now, regarding your past medical history – have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe. The doctor, old Dr. Miller, said something about it years ago. Gave me some pills. Didn't like taking them, made me feel funny. So I stopped. Been fine since, as far as I know. Never been sick, never had anything serious. Pile driving keeps a man strong, you know? Used to be able to work all day without a problem. Nothing fancy, never needed a hospital or anything. Just a bit of a bad back now and then. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had a surgery in my life. What would be the point? Pile driving is a rough job, gets you cuts and bruises, but never needed no knife. No, never. And I don’t want any now. Don’t like hospitals. Full of germs and… waiting. Just tell me if you can fix this, or not. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. We'll do our best to be efficient. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – for example, heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my father… he was a strong man too. Worked on the docks. Died young, though. Heart, they said. Sudden like. And my mother… she lived a good long life, but always complaining about her joints. Arthritis, I think. That’s about it. Nobody else much. Didn't keep up with the family, not really. Mostly just remember my parents. Strong people, both of them. Died before their time, though. A bit like me, feeling now. Getting old, and weak. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is helpful, Mr. Trendler. A family history of heart disease and arthritis is good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I wake up, I eat something… when I can. Used to eat a good breakfast, proper Jamaican food, but now… not so much. I read the paper. I watch a bit of TV. Mostly news. And… I sit. Mostly I just sit now. Not much else to do. Used to be busy, always working, always moving. Now… quiet. Too quiet. Is that what you want to know? A boring life, that's what it is. A very boring life.
DOCTOR: No, it sounds like you’ve experienced a significant change in your routine, Mr. Trendler. And that can be difficult. Just a couple more questions, if you don't mind. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills. Nothing else. Maybe a painkiller now and then for my back, but not regular. Just when it flares up. Used to be able to handle it myself, you know? Pile driving keeps a man strong. But now… not so much. Just the occasional painkiller. And maybe a little something for my joints when it's cold. But that's it. Nothing fancy. I don't like pills. Make me feel… wrong. Is that everything? Can we get to the part where you tell me if you can fix this? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Mr. Trendler. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies in my life. Not to food, not to pills, not to anything. Strong constitution, always been that way. Pile driving and all, you know? A bit of dust, a bit of dirt, never bothered me. No allergies. Never had any. Now, can we get on with it? I’m starting to feel a bit tired just talking about it. Tell me what you can do. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for providing me with this information. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? Look, I don’t like being poked and prodded. Never been one for doctors. But if you have to, I suppose you can. Just… be quick about it. And don’t dig around too much. I haven’t got all day, you know. And be gentle. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Just relax as much as you can. Deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 160 over 90. A bit high, as you suspected. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. I notice some softness in the abdominal area, and it seems a bit tender to the touch. Your muscle tone is reduced as well. No masses or any obvious abnormalities. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Ouch! Easy there, you know. That’s… tender. Like I said. And stop poking. Don't like being handled like this. Just tell me what you think. Is it fixable or not? No need for all this… poking and prodding. I'm a simple man, you know. Just want a straight answer. Stop with the reflexes and all that nonsense. Just… what can you do? And how long will it take? I haven’t got all day, you know. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand your discomfort. We'll stop there. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination I was able to perform, it sounds like you’re experiencing a loss of muscle mass, likely due to a combination of reduced physical activity, dietary changes, and possibly the grief you’ve experienced. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. It is fixable, but it will require a multi-pronged approach. It won't be a quick fix, I'm afraid. We'll need to focus on several things: a healthier diet, incorporating regular exercise, and getting your blood pressure under control. I recommend we start with some blood work to get a more detailed picture of your overall health and rule out any other underlying conditions. Then, I’d like to refer you to a registered dietitian to help you develop a personalized meal plan, and a physical therapist to design a safe and effective exercise program. We can also discuss medication options for your blood pressure, but I’d prefer to start with lifestyle modifications first. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Blood work… diet… exercise… it sounds like a lot of work. And I don’t like pills. Honestly, I just wanted a quick fix. Something to tighten things up, you know? Not all this… fuss. A pill, maybe? Something to take and be done with it? I haven’t got the energy for all this… lifestyle modification. Look, how long will all this take? The blood work, the diet, the exercise… it sounds like months. I’m an old man, you know. I just want to feel a bit better. Is there anything quick you can do? Honestly. And how much will all this cost? I’m on a fixed income. Don’t need any surprises. Just give it to me straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. You're looking for a quick solution, and I appreciate your honesty about the challenges of lifestyle changes. A pill would be the easiest route, but unfortunately, there isn't a magic bullet for this. Medication can help manage your blood pressure, and we can certainly discuss that, but it won't address the underlying cause of the muscle loss. Regarding the timeline, the blood work will take a few days to process. Seeing the dietitian and physical therapist would be separate appointments, likely scheduled within the next couple of weeks. The duration of the program depends on your progress and commitment, but we're talking several months to see significant results. As for the cost, the blood work will be covered by your insurance, with a co-pay that you'll need to pay at the time of the test. The dietitian and physical therapy appointments will also be covered by your insurance, subject to your deductible and co-pays. I can have our billing department provide you with a detailed estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. Before we proceed with any testing or referrals, I want to be upfront: lifestyle changes are essential for improving your health and well-being. If you're not willing to commit to that, then medication alone may not be the best option. Perhaps we can start with a low-dose blood pressure medication, combined with some simple dietary recommendations, such as increasing your protein intake. We can also explore some gentle exercises that you can do at home, without needing a physical therapist. Would you be open to trying that as a starting point?
PATIENT: Low dose pill… and a bit of eating better… and some easy exercises… that… that might be doable. I don't like the idea of being on medication, but a low dose… and if it helps… and if it doesn’t take too long… alright. But no fancy exercises. Nothing strenuous. Just something simple. And no diet fads. I just want to eat more… proper food. Jamaican food. Alright. Let's start with the pill and the… simple stuff. But if it doesn't work, I’m not wasting any more time or money. Understand? And don’t expect miracles. I’m an old man. Just want to feel a bit better. Now, get me that pill. And tell me about the food. What kind of simple stuff are we talking about? Don’t want any surprises. Honestly. .
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Trendler. I think that’s a good starting point. I’m going to prescribe a low dose of Lisinopril for your blood pressure. We’ll start with 10 milligrams once a day. I’ll also write you a referral to a registered dietitian who specializes in culturally appropriate meal planning. She can help you create a personalized plan that includes your favorite Jamaican foods, while ensuring you’re getting the nutrients you need. As for the "simple stuff," we’re talking about increasing your protein intake with foods like fish, chicken, beans, and lentils. Incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet, and reducing your intake of processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats. I'll also give you a handout with some gentle exercises you can do at home, such as walking, chair exercises, and light stretching. Start slowly, and listen to your body. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in four weeks so we can monitor your blood pressure and discuss your progress. Does that sound good?
