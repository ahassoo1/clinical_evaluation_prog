DOCTOR: Hi Nykisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it’s been a few months now, but my skin has been getting darker. Not like…sunburnt, just generally darker, you know? And I’ve been feeling really tired a lot, even when I get enough sleep. It’s just…odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue… those can be a few different things. Let’s try to get a bit more detail about both. First, about the skin darkening – where is it happening?
PATIENT: Hmm…it started on my hands and feet, I think. And now it’s…pretty much everywhere, but it’s most noticeable on my hands and feet and around my knuckles. It’s not patchy, it’s just…even. Does that make sense? I haven't been going out in the sun any more than usual, so I was surprised when I noticed it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Even darkening, starting on the hands and feet… okay. And you said a few months?
PATIENT: Yeah, probably about three or four months now. It wasn’t sudden, it just…gradually got darker. I didn't really think much of it at first, figured it was just…something with the light, or maybe I was imagining things. But then I started feeling so tired all the time, and I thought maybe they were connected.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say tired, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s…hard to explain. It’s not just sleepy, you know? It’s like…everything takes so much effort. Like, even just getting up and doing things around the house feels exhausting. And I sleep okay, usually seven or eight hours, but I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. It’s been making it hard to concentrate at work too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and skin darkening… Let's go through some other things to get a better picture. Do you have any other symptoms – anything at all, even if it doesn't seem related?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? And…now that you mention it, I think I’m a little constipated. Not terrible, but…yeah, definitely not as regular as I used to be. I haven’t noticed anything else, really. Oh! And my appetite hasn’t been great, but I figured that was just because I’m so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, thirst, constipation, and decreased appetite alongside the fatigue and skin changes. I want to ask about your medical history – have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a couple of times, and I broke my wrist when I was younger, but nothing major. I don’t take any regular medications. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor when I need to, but I haven’t been in for anything serious in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history, no medications, no allergies. What about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my dad had high blood pressure. That’s about all I can remember, to be honest. They both passed away a long time ago, so I don’t really know much about their medical history beyond that. And I don’t have any siblings, so there’s no one to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to round things out, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at the chemical plant, so it's pretty active, lots of walking and checking systems. I usually eat okay, I try to. I don't drink a lot, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. I live alone, so I mostly keep to myself. Nothing too exciting, really. I don’t do a lot of traveling or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Alright, Nykisha, based on what you've told me, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I want to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin more closely. Also, I'm going to want to order some blood work to get a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on with me. I'm getting worried. Blood work is fine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. If you could just sit here for me… And then we’ll take a look at your skin. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 142 over 90. Your pulse is normal at 78. Let's move on to listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I see the darkening you mentioned. It’s fairly uniform, no lesions or anything concerning. It's most prominent on your knuckles and the soles of your feet. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good starting point. The lab results usually take a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once they're back to discuss the results and next steps. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A few days is fine. I appreciate you taking the time to look at everything. And explain it all to me. I just hope it's nothing too serious. So, I just go to the lab and they’ll do the blood work?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. I'll send the order electronically to the lab – it’s right across the street. They'll call you to schedule an appointment if needed. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the test, just try to drink plenty of water beforehand. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial exam, we need to rule out a few things. Your symptoms – fatigue, skin darkening, decreased appetite, constipation – could be related to several conditions. We need those lab results to get a clearer picture. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I guess. You explained everything pretty well. Just…try to get the results back as soon as you can, okay? I'm a little anxious, waiting. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your anxiety, and we'll get those results back as quickly as possible. My nurse will be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you feel significantly weaker, more confused, or develop any new symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Here’s a copy of the lab order for your records. Take care, Nykisha. .
