DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...something down there. A bit of a mess, really. Not nice. It's been...leaking. Yeah, leaking. Don't know how long, though. Old age, I guess. Everything starts to go, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Something down there" and some leaking. We'll definitely figure this out. When you say leaking, can you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Describe? Well...it's not like a waterfall, Doctor. Not that much. More like...a drip. A slow drip. And it's...not clear. Yellowish, maybe? I dunno. I don't really look at it, you know? It just...is there. Makes things sticky. And smells a little funny. Not a good smell. Like...old fish, maybe? Though I haven't smelled old fish in ages. Honestly, it's embarrassing even talking about it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your embarrassment, Ms. Genard. It is a sensitive topic, and you're doing the right thing by bringing it to my attention. A yellowish discharge with an odor… that's helpful information. And it's good you noticed the color change. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Let me think. Everything's kinda... achy these days, Doctor. Hard to tell what's from that and what's just...old bones. I get a little tired, but who doesn't? Oh! Sometimes it itches. Down there, where it's leaking. Not all the time, but sometimes. And...I don't know if this matters, but it feels a little...sore. Like I been rubbing against something rough. But I haven't, not that I know of. Honestly, I just try not to bother it. It's probably nothing, right? Just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so achiness, fatigue, itching, and soreness with a sensation of rubbing... those are all things we need to consider. It's good you're telling me everything, even if you think it might not be important. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, Lord. That was a long time ago. Old Man Tanaka, the village doctor, he patched me up when I was a kid. A bad scrape on my knee, I think. And when my mama passed, I was just...sad. He gave me something for that, something sweet tasting. That's about it, really. I don't go to doctors. Never have. Waste of money, mostly. And they always poke and prod. I just figure things will fix themselves. Mama always said a good rest and some coconut oil fixes everything. Don't have much insurance, you know. Can't afford it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you haven't had a lot of regular medical care, and that's okay. We'll work with what we have. Since you mentioned not having much insurance, we’ll keep costs in mind as we figure things out. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh, no, never. Not me. Too scary. Too many sick people. I avoid hospitals like the plague. Surgeries? Definitely not. I'm too old to be lying on a table letting someone cut me open! Besides, like I said, I've always just taken care of things myself. Coconut oil and a good rest. That's all I need. Though... now this leakin' thing is worryin' me a bit. It's not goin' away, you know? That's why I finally came. But still, no hospitals. Promise me, Doctor, no hospitals.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand your concerns about hospitals, Ms. Genard, and I promise we will explore every option before considering that. We'll start with a gentle examination and see what we can find. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family—your mother, sisters, aunts—has had similar problems, or any issues with their reproductive health?
PATIENT: Reproductive health? Oh dear. We didn't talk about things like that, back in my day. Mama just said women had babies, and that was that. No discussin'. My sisters… they all had babies, too, I think. But nobody ever talked about...leaks. Or aches. Or smells. It was just… private. Nobody shared. We were Chamorro women, you know? We kept things to ourselves. So, no, I don’t know if anyone had this problem. Honestly, I doubt it. We were strong women. Didn't complain about things like this. But...maybe they did. Just didn't tell anyone. It's a mystery, I guess. Is this important, Doctor? Seems like a lot of askin' about private things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it wasn't common to discuss these topics openly in your family. That's perfectly alright. It's helpful to know, but we can move on if it's uncomfortable. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently—even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no medications. I don't believe in all those pills. They just make you sicker, I think. I've got a little jar of ginger for my stomach, sometimes. And I rub some menthol on my chest when I cough. But that's it. No pills. Never have. I like things natural, you know? Coconut oil, ginger, menthol… those are good enough for me. I don't trust those doctors and their fancy medicines. And like I said, I don't have the money for them anyway. This leakin’ thing… it's just… a bad patch, I guess. It’ll probably go away on its own. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just natural remedies. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Genard, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a gentle physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A...physical exam? Oh, dear. You mean...look at it? Down there? I... I don't know, Doctor. That's a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? I already told you about the leakin'. What more do you need to see? I just... I don't like being poked and prodded. It's private. Very private. Is there another way? Can't you just give me something for it? Maybe some coconut oil? Or a good rest? I really don't want you lookin' down there. Promise me you won't poke too much. And be quick about it, please. Very quick. This is makin' me nervous, Doctor. Very nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Genard, and I completely respect your privacy. I wouldn’t do anything you’re not comfortable with. I promise to be as gentle and quick as possible. The exam is really the best way for me to figure out what’s going on and make sure it's nothing serious. It will help me determine the cause of the discharge and the best way to treat it. We can start slowly. I'll explain everything as I go. I’ll use a clean speculum, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain the exam in more detail first?
PATIENT: Explain? Oh, dear. I don't even know what a 'speculum' is! Sounds scary. Is it going to hurt? I really don't like pain. Mama always said a good doctor shouldn't cause pain. Will you be wearing gloves? I don't want any… germs. Honestly, Doctor, I'm gettin' a bit flustered. Maybe I should just go home. Maybe it will just go away on its own. But... you promised not to poke too much, right? And you'll explain everything? I just... I'm an old woman. I've lived a long life. I don't need any trouble now. Tell me about this… speculum. What does it do? Is it cold? Please, Doctor, be gentle. Very, very gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Genard. It's perfectly alright to be nervous, and you're right to ask questions. A speculum is a smooth, curved instrument that we gently insert into the vagina to allow me to visualize the cervix, which is the opening to the uterus. It doesn’t hurt, but you might feel some pressure, like when you're having a Pap smear. It’s not cold, and we can warm it up first if you prefer. I will absolutely be wearing gloves, and everything is sterile to prevent any germs. We can take things very slowly. We don't have to do the exam right now if you're not comfortable. We can start by just talking, and if you decide later you want to proceed, we can. Would you like me to show you the speculum first, so you can see what it looks like?
PATIENT: Show me? Oh, dear. I don't know… I suppose. If you think that will help. But don't get too close! I don't want it… near me. Just… show it to me. But gently, Doctor. Very gently. And explain what all the… bits are for. I just… I don't like surprises. I'm an old woman, you know. Easily startled. And don't poke too much, even with just showin' me. I really don't want to be poked. This is makin' me very anxious. Very, very anxious. Just… show me the thing. Quickly. And gently. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard, here it is. It’s made of plastic, and it's smooth and curved. See?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It looks scary. Like a little… tool. What are those… prongs for? Are you going to… open me up with that? It looks like something a mechanic would use! And it's cold. Is it supposed to be cold? I really don't like it. No, no, no. I don't think I want to see any more of it. Just… put it away, Doctor. Please. This is too much. I think… I think I just want to go home. Maybe it will just go away on its own. This is too stressful. Too stressful for an old woman. Just… put it away, and let me go home. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. You are absolutely right. We can stop right here. I completely understand, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. Your comfort is the most important thing. We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Since you’re not comfortable with an exam today, let’s talk about some other options. I can prescribe a cream to help with the discharge, but without knowing the cause, it’s hard to say if it will be effective. I also strongly recommend a follow-up appointment so we can re-evaluate and discuss other possibilities. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A cream? Hmm… That sounds… less scary. If it doesn't involve any pokin'. And a follow-up… I suppose. But promise me, Doctor, no pressure. No pokin', no proddin'. Just talkin'. And if I decide I don't want to come back, that's okay too, right? I'm an old woman, you know. I've got things to do. But… a cream sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t smell funny. And it's easy to use. I don't have much strength in my hands these days. So… yes. A cream sounds alright. If it doesn’t smell. And no pokin' at the follow-up. Promise?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. No pressure, no poking, and a follow-up only if you want one. I'll prescribe a cream that's unscented and easy to apply. It's a simple, over-the-counter antifungal cream, which can help with many types of discharge. It comes in a tube that's easy to squeeze. I'll also write down instructions for how to use it. It's applied twice a day for a week. And if you decide you don't want to come back, that's perfectly fine. Your health is your decision. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A simple cream, twice a day… I can manage that. As long as it doesn't smell. And it's easy to squeeze. You've been very kind, Doctor. Even though… the speculum was scary. But you listened to me. And you didn't poke. That's important. Thank you. I think… I think that will be enough for today. Just the cream. And maybe… maybe I’ll think about a follow-up. But no promises. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman. Very patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Genard. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the prescription. I'll also give you a sheet with some information about discharge and what to look out for. Please take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
