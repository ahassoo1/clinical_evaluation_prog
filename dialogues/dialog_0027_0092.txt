DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Fazzina, huh? Sounds…foreign. Anyway. I’m here 'cause I can’t…breathe good. Not like I used to. And my mouth feels like sandpaper. And my eyes too, all scratchy. It’s been gettin’ worse, I think. Don't really keep track of dates, you know? Old age.
DOCTOR: Right, right. “Not breathing good,” and a dry mouth and eyes… and it’s been worsening, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, worsening. Definitely. It’s like…when I walk, I gotta stop. Used to be I could walk all day. Now? A block and I’m done. And the thirst…always thirsty. It’s…annoying. Don’t ask me when it started, I wouldn’t know. Maybe a few months? A year? Time just…goes. You understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Guilds. It’s common for things to feel…less distinct as time goes on. Okay, so shortness of breath with walking, and increased thirst… and the dry mouth and eyes. Have you noticed any cough, or chest pain with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Cough? Sometimes. Not a bad one, just…a tickle. Like somethin’ stuck in my throat. No pain, though. Never had pain. I’m a tough old Cuban, you know? We don't feel pain. Mostly. What's this got to do with my mouth being dry anyway? Seems kinda separate, don’t it?
DOCTOR: It might be connected, Mr. Guilds. Dry mouth can sometimes be a sign of dehydration, or other things going on. Let me just pull up your records here… Okay, I see you've had Medicare for some time. And… your weight is listed as 94 kilograms. Has that changed recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, I dunno. Probably. I eat. I like to eat. Rice and beans, mostly. And a little bit of pork if my niece brings it over. She’s a good girl, my niece. Always lookin’ after me. I wouldn't know how much I weigh. Never really bothered me. Why does it matter? Are you sayin’ I’m too heavy? I’m just a regular size, for a Cuban!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Just gathering information. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before—like diabetes, or heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No! Never. Strong heart. I tell ya. I worked hard my whole life. Traffic technician, you know? Standin’ in the sun, directin’ cars. Builds a strong heart. Diabetes? Never heard of it. Sounds…fancy. Some kinda city disease, probably. I mostly just get regular aches and pains. Old age, like I said. What’s a traffic technician anyway? You wouldn't know, you're too young.
DOCTOR: I may be younger, but I can look things up! No history of diabetes or heart problems noted in your records… Alright. And any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Nope. Never needed one. I'm a tough old Cuban, remember? We fix ourselves. Hospital? Maybe once, a long time ago. Fell off a ladder, I think. But it wasn’t serious. Just a scrape. They patched me up and sent me home. Don't recall the year, though. Everything’s a blur. Look, are you gonna fix my breathing or what? I got things to do. Not much, but things.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Guilds. We’ll get to that. I just need to do a quick physical exam, to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will only take a few minutes. If you don’t mind, could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Lie down? At my age? I ain’t as nimble as I used to be. But alright, alright. Don’t expect me to jump up and down. Slow and steady, that's me. But what are you even lookin’ for? You're gonna poke and prod, I suppose. Just be gentle, okay? And hurry up. My niece is makin’ arroz con pollo tonight, and I don’t wanna miss it.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Mr. Guilds. I'm just going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and eyes. Take a deep breath for me, if you can… and let it out slowly. Your breathing sounds a little…wheezy. Not overly concerning at this point, but something we need to investigate. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150 over 90. Throat looks a little dry, as you mentioned. Now, let me just take a quick look in your eyes… Eyes are a little dry as well, and I see some mild redness.
PATIENT: Wheezy? Fast? Redness? You’re makin’ me nervous now! All this talk of things bein’ wrong. I just want to breathe normal again, that’s all. Look, I told you, I'm an old man. Things are gonna be wrong! What does all this mean? Are you gonna give me pills? I don't like pills. And don't tell me to exercise. I tried that once. Didn’t end well.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Guilds. It’s good that we’re talking about this. These findings aren't necessarily cause for alarm, but they do warrant further investigation. The wheezing and redness suggest some possible inflammation in your airways. The elevated blood pressure is something we want to monitor as well. I’d like to order a couple of tests. A basic blood work panel to check your overall health, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We can also do a simple oxygen saturation test right here in the office to see how well your body is getting oxygen. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Blood work…I hate needles. And an X-ray? Is that safe? You’re gonna take pictures of my insides? What if you find somethin’ bad? I don’t wanna know. Look, can’t you just give me somethin’ for my throat? A lozenge or somethin’? I’m a simple man. I don't need fancy tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Guilds. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. The blood work is just a simple draw, and we can use a very small needle. The X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation—less than you get from a cross-country flight—and it helps us rule out any serious issues. We can start with a lozenge for your throat, and I’ll write you a prescription for one. But the tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on and allow us to provide you with the best possible care. Before we proceed, let me explain why I think these tests are important. Your symptoms – shortness of breath, dry mouth, wheezing – could be caused by a number of things, like a mild infection, allergies, or even something more serious like early-stage pneumonia or heart failure. The tests will help us pinpoint the cause and get you the right treatment. Would you be willing to consider the blood work and X-ray, just to be safe?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Pneumonia?! Now you're scaring me! I just want to breathe, that's all! You're makin' it sound like I'm dyin'. Look, I don't like this one bit. But… alright. Alright, fine. Do the tests. But hurry up. And be gentle! And tell me what's going on, okay? No fancy medical words. Just… plain English. I'm an old Cuban, not a doctor. And if you find somethin’ bad, don't sugarcoat it, but don’t scare me to death either. Just… tell me straight. And where do I go for these tests?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. I promise to explain everything in plain English, and I won’t scare you. I'll also take things slowly and answer any questions you have. The tests are just to rule things out and make sure we’re on the right track. We’re going to start with the blood work right here in the office. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. Then, you’ll go to the imaging center across the street for the chest X-ray. I’ll give you a referral slip and instructions. It shouldn't take long. Here’s the referral slip and the instructions for the imaging center. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for throat lozenges to help with the dryness. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I take a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. But I forget what it's called. And…my niece gives me something for my arthritis, when it’s bad. But that’s all. I mostly just take what people give me. I don’t really pay attention. Look, is this gonna cost me a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare doesn’t cover everything, they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me check your Medicare coverage. It looks like your Medicare should cover both the blood work and the chest X-ray, with a small co-pay. The exact amount will depend on your plan, but it shouldn’t be too significant. We have a billing department here who can help you understand the costs and navigate any potential issues. I’ll have them speak with you after the tests, if you’d like. Here's their number. Don’t hesitate to call them if you have any questions. Now, while we wait for the phlebotomist, let me ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or cough with phlegm?
PATIENT: Phlegm? What's phlegm? Like…stuff you cough up? Sometimes. When I’m sick. Not much, though. Just a little. And no chills, no fever. I get a little warm sometimes, but that’s just the sun. I was a traffic technician, remember? Always in the sun. This is all very complicated. I just want to breathe normal. And maybe have some arroz con pollo tonight. My niece makes a good one. She puts olives in it. Do you like olives?
DOCTOR: Olives are good. I enjoy them myself. It’s alright if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed, Mr. Guilds. It’s a lot to take in. Okay. So, no fever, chills, or significant phlegm. That’s helpful. The phlebotomist should be here any moment to draw your blood. It will just be a quick prick in your arm. Once that’s done, you can head over to the imaging center. Do you have someone who can drive you over there?
PATIENT: Drive me? No. I walk. I still walk. But… it’s a bit of a walk. And I get tired. My niece usually drives me, but she’s at work. I can walk it, I guess. I’m a tough old Cuban, remember? But… maybe if I could just rest for a bit after the blood work? Before I walk all that way?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. Absolutely. You can rest here for as long as you need after the blood work. We have a comfortable waiting area. You don’t have to rush. We’ll get you settled and comfortable before you head over to the imaging center. Oh, good, the phlebotomist is here. She’s going to take care of your blood work now. It will only take a few minutes. Just let me know if you feel dizzy or uncomfortable at any point. And remember, we’re here to help you. Everything will be alright.
PATIENT: Alright. Alright. Dizzy… I get dizzy sometimes. Especially when it’s hot. But I’ll be alright. Just… be gentle, okay? And hurry up. I got arroz con pollo waitin' for me. And olives.
DOCTOR: I’ll be right here, Mr. Guilds. And I promise, we'll get through this quickly.
