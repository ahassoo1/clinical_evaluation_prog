DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I keep getting in my side, lower down. And… the waterworks. Seems like I get infections quite a bit, down there. It's been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: "On and off" is a bit vague, Mr. Espinueva. Can you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's hard to say exactly. Years, really. But it feels worse lately. Maybe the last six months it's been more frequent. I used to just get a little ache now and then, but now… it’s a proper pain, you know? And the infections… at least three times this year, I think. Perhaps four. I do try to drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Four infections in six months is quite a bit, Mr. Espinueva. And when you say "infections," have these been confirmed by a doctor – a urine test, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, they have. Every time I go to the clinic with the trouble, they test it. They always say it’s an infection. I get a prescription, and it clears up for a bit. Then it comes back. It’s… tiresome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good that they’ve been confirmed. Repeated infections suggest we need to investigate why they keep happening. Now, let’s talk about the pain itself. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: It’s a… a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes it’s sharp, like a really bad cramp. It’s on my left side, lower down. It comes and goes, but when it's bad, it’s hard to move. It doesn't go all the way through to my back, not usually. It’s just… there. Sometimes I feel a bit sick with it, too. Not proper vomiting sick, just… queasy.
DOCTOR: Queasiness… alright. And does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, no. It just… comes on. Sometimes after I’ve been walking a bit, but not always. And sometimes it just wakes me up in the night. It doesn't seem to matter what I’ve eaten, or what I’ve been doing. It’s very… unpredictable, really. Frustrating, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. I see you've had some previous visits to the clinic, let me pull up your records here. Alright, it does show frequent UTIs… and a few mentions of flank pain. Now, have you had any issues with your kidneys in the past – stones, for example?
PATIENT: Kidney stones… no, Doctor, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I had them. I've had a lot of trouble with my waterworks over the years, especially as I’ve gotten older, but no one ever mentioned stones. They just said I had infections, and gave me something for them. I'm not even sure what kidney trouble feels like, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the frequent infections and the flank pain, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your abdomen and back, and I’ll gently press on a few areas. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do to figure out what’s going on. I’m happy to help. It’s just… tiring, always being unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Now, I’m going to gently press here and here… any tenderness when I do this?
PATIENT: Right, no problem. … Yes, a little bit there, on my left side. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. And maybe a little bit here, too. It’s hard to say exactly, Doctor. Everything feels a bit sore, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the left flank… and some general discomfort. Your abdomen sounds relatively normal, no obvious masses or fluid. Now, I'd like to order a urine sample for a full analysis and culture, just to confirm the infection and identify the specific bacteria. And I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of your kidneys, bladder, and surrounding structures. We need to rule out any blockages or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. A bit concerning, perhaps, but if it will help figure things out, then yes, I’m happy to have it done. The urine sample is no trouble at all. Just let me know where to go. Will it show anything serious, do you think? I hope it’s not anything too bad.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Espinueva, it’s important to remember we're just gathering information at this point. The scan will help us see what’s going on, and it doesn't necessarily mean there is anything serious. But given your history of frequent infections and the flank pain, it’s prudent to investigate. The nurse will give you a container for the urine sample, and she’ll direct you to the radiology department for the CT scan. It’s a quick procedure – you’ll just lie on a table while the machine takes some pictures. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… hmm. I don’t think so, Doctor. I’ve never had a scan before, so I wouldn’t know. I’ve got a bit of a sensitive stomach, generally, but I haven’t got any specific allergies that I know of. Should I tell the radiology people about my stomach?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, let the radiology staff know about your sensitive stomach. They can adjust the dye dosage or give you something to help with any potential nausea. Alright, I’m going to write up the orders for the urine sample and CT scan now. The nurse will be in shortly with instructions. In the meantime, please try not to worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you for taking the time to listen, and for doing these tests. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about it. I do hope it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
