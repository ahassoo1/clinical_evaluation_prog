DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s a soreness in my mouth. It’s not serious, I assure you. I just… thought I should get it checked. It's been a few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed, Mr. Schieber. We check all sorts of things here. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Three, maybe four days. It started… well, I don’t know how it started. Just… there. And it’s uncomfortable. It makes eating a bit… unpleasant. I’m a busy man, Doctor. Let’s not dwell on the specifics unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Right, I appreciate that. Three or four days, and it's making eating uncomfortable. Can you tell me a little more about the soreness itself?
PATIENT: It’s… white. Patches. In my mouth. Mostly on my tongue, I think. And it hurts when I… consume anything acidic. Or spicy. Really, anything with flavor, if I’m being honest. I eat very simply, usually. This is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, white patches on your tongue, mostly, and it's painful with acidic or spicy foods, or anything flavorful. Do you notice any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? It hurts. Isn’t that enough of a symptom? No, Doctor, I don't have… other symptoms. I don't have a fever. I don't have… spots anywhere else. It’s localized. Clearly. And I suspect it’s something minor. I really don’t have time for extensive testing.
DOCTOR: Right, no fever, no spots elsewhere, just the soreness in your mouth. And you're hoping it's something minor. I understand. Let's take a quick look, if you don’t mind. Just open wide for me, and I’ll have a look around.
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have appointments, you know. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some white patches on your tongue, as you mentioned. They do appear a bit inflamed. Do you notice any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No. No difficulty swallowing. Absolutely not. I eat perfectly normally. It’s just… unpleasant. As I said. And honestly, Doctor, is that all you’re going to do? Look at it? I was expecting… something more. A diagnosis, perhaps? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. Based on what you've told me and a quick look, it could be a few things. It could be something called oral thrush – a yeast infection in the mouth. It’s not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Or it could be something like lichen planus, which causes inflammation. To be sure, we could do a quick swab to send to the lab. That would give us a definitive answer. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Must we? Look, Doctor, I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene. A yeast infection… that sounds… preposterous. I haven't had a yeast infection since… well, ever. And lichen planus? Is that even a real thing? I’m a faller, not a… a botanical specimen. Honestly, I’m starting to suspect this is a waste of my time. I’ll just… try some mouthwash. A strong one. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Schieber. While good hygiene is important, thrush can happen even with good care, especially if your system is a little off. And lichen planus is a real condition, an inflammatory one affecting the mouth. However, I respect your wishes. Using a strong mouthwash is a reasonable first step. I would recommend one containing… let me see… …chlorhexidine gluconate. It's an antiseptic. Rinse twice daily after meals. If it doesn’t improve within a week, or if it worsens, please come back, and we can reconsider the swab. It's important to rule out anything more serious. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Chlorhexidine… got it. A week. And then, I suppose, I’ll return. If absolutely necessary. I really must be going now. I have a schedule to maintain, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. You're welcome. If you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
