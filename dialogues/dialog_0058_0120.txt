DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he passed, and I don’t want to deal with any of those… complications people have. Is that… possible? Just a normal pregnancy, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, I understand you’d like to become pregnant, and you're hoping for a straightforward experience. It's good you're planning ahead. Let's start with a little background. Have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not really. I just… figured things would happen. I mean, I was married for a long time. It should just… work, right? I don't understand why I'd need to try. Is something wrong with me? Honestly, this is already taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. While a previous, healthy relationship can make conception easier, it doesn't guarantee it will happen immediately, or without any assistance. It’s actually quite common for couples – or individuals, in your case – to take several months to conceive. But let's get a better understanding of your situation. First, can you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? I barely pay attention. They… happen. Every month, I guess. Regular? I don’t know. I've never really kept track. It’s not like I needed to before, and now… well, now I’m supposed to remember all this stuff? Look, is there a test I can just take to see if everything’s alright? I really don't have time for this whole life story thing.
DOCTOR: Right. A test is certainly part of it, yes. But we need some information beforehand to know what to look for, and to interpret the results correctly. Okay. Do you happen to know when your last menstrual period was?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I really don’t. It was… sometime in July, probably? Maybe June? I don’t know! It’s been a while, okay? And honestly, it’s a little personal, don’t you think? I’m here to have a baby, not give you a calendar of my… private life. Can we just skip to the test? I have a lunch meeting, and I'm already running late.
DOCTOR: Okay. While I understand your desire to expedite things, Ms. Villarreal, getting a precise history is important for your health and safety. A rough estimate of your last period is helpful, but it does impact how we proceed. Alright. Let’s focus on other things then. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No! Never. I… always thought it would just happen naturally, like I said. Is that a problem? Is me not having been pregnant before a problem? I just… I don't understand why everything is so complicated. People have babies all the time! Why is my situation so different? I really think I’m wasting my time here. Honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a problem that you haven't been pregnant before, Ms. Villarreal. It simply means we need to do some baseline testing to ensure everything is functioning as it should. Before we order any tests, let's just quickly cover some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. I think I'm allergic to… dust? Maybe? I sneeze sometimes. And I don't like penicillin, but that's more of a dislike than an allergy, I think. Honestly, I haven't been to a doctor in years. I keep myself healthy. I eat well, I get enough sleep... well, mostly. This is all just… so tedious. Can we please just move on to the tests now? I have a very important meeting and I don't want to be late. I really think I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can proceed with some initial blood work. This will help us assess your hormone levels and check for any underlying conditions that might impact fertility. We’ll also do a basic physical exam. First, let me explain the blood draw process…
PATIENT: Ugh, blood? Seriously? Look, I really, really don’t like needles. Can’t we just… skip that part? Maybe there’s a different test? Some kind of scan? Anything but a needle. This is ridiculous. I came here for a simple thing, and now I have to endure torture? I swear, I’m going to have to cancel my meeting. This is a complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, blood work is a crucial part of the initial fertility evaluation. It provides us with valuable information that we cannot obtain any other way. I understand your aversion to needles, but it is a necessary step to ensure your health and determine the best course of action. We can use a smaller gauge needle to minimize discomfort, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. However, skipping this step is not an option if you want a thorough assessment. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
