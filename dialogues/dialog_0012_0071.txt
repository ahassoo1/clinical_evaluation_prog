DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter saying I should come in to discuss what shots I need… for, well, my paperwork. I’m hoping to get everything sorted so I can visit family. It’s a bit confusing, all of it, to be honest. I just want to make sure I have everything right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Karry, that makes perfect sense. It can be confusing navigating all the recommended vaccinations, especially with travel involved. We'll definitely get everything sorted out. So, this paperwork is for travel… do you know where you’re planning on visiting?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. I’m trying to visit my daughter and her family. They moved to Canada, just outside of Vancouver, British Columbia. It's been too long since I've seen my grandchildren. That’s why I’m trying to get this done… to make sure I can go. I don’t want to cause any trouble at the border.
DOCTOR: Okay, Canada… Vancouver. Good to know. That helps us narrow down what we need to consider. Have you had any vaccinations recently – even just a flu shot or a tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get a flu shot every year, usually at the pharmacy in the fall. And… I think I had a tetanus shot… maybe five years ago? It was after I stepped on a nail in the garden. But other than that… not really. It's hard to remember exactly. I don’t keep very good track of these things, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Karry. Many people don’t keep track! We can look it up if needed, but for now, that gives us a starting point. Do you have any allergies to medications or vaccines?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I did have a bit of a fever once after a flu shot, but nothing too serious. Just a little achy for a day or two.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It's called Celebrex, I believe. My doctor prescribed it a few years back. And… sometimes I take a multivitamin, but not every day. It depends if I remember! It’s nothing regular, I assure you. Just the Celebrex is consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex for arthritis. That's helpful to know. Do you mind if I ask how long you've been taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… probably close to eight years now. Maybe a little longer. It really helps with the pain in my hands and knees, you see. It makes it easier to… well, to do things. Gardening, mostly. I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear it’s helping you stay active. Eight years, okay. Now, before we talk about specific vaccinations, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had pneumonia when I was younger, about… forty years ago. I was in the hospital for a week, but I recovered fully. Other than that… not much, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I did have some issues with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been well-controlled with diet and exercise, thankfully. No diabetes or heart problems, if that’s what you were wondering.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Pneumonia long ago, well-controlled blood pressure… excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, ma’am. I had my gallbladder removed when I was in my early fifties. It was causing me a lot of trouble, so the doctor recommended it. It went well, though. No complications, thankfully. It was a long time ago now, I barely even remember it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal. Good. Now, I always like to ask about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother had diabetes, unfortunately. She developed it later in life, but it was quite severe. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. He had a stroke a few years before he passed. My sister, on the other hand, is very healthy. She doesn’t have any major health issues, thankfully. As far as I know, nobody else in the family has had anything too serious. Though, we weren’t very close, so I don't know the full story.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father. That’s helpful. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I'm a widower. My wife, bless her heart, passed away five years ago. I live alone now, in a small house just outside of town. I keep busy with my garden, mostly. And I volunteer at the library a few times a week. I enjoy reading and… well, just keeping myself occupied. I don't drink or smoke, never have. I used to travel a lot with my wife, but I haven't done much of that since she passed. I mostly stay close to home now.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry for your loss, Karry. It sounds like you keep very busy, though, which is wonderful. Now, to get back to the vaccinations… Have you ever had a measles, mumps, rubella vaccine?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a long time ago, but I’m doing alright. As for the shots… oh dear. I really don’t recall. I had all my shots as a child, of course, but it was so long ago. I don’t think I ever had any booster shots as an adult. I honestly couldn't tell you if I’ve had that MMR one or not. It’s just… hard to remember things from that long ago. I’m afraid I don’t have any records either.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Karry. It’s very common to not have records from that long ago. In that case, we’ll treat it as if you haven’t had it. It's often recommended to get a booster, especially with travel. Now, let's talk about the physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just want to make sure I have everything sorted out for my trip, so I’m glad you’re being so thorough. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Karry, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your overall appearance is good, but I notice some mild arthritis in your hands, consistent with your history. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. No acute concerns. Now, do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: That all sounds… good, I suppose. What does all that mean, exactly? And what about the shots? What will I need? I’m a little worried about getting sick from them, to be honest. I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: That all means your vitals are within a normal range for your age, and your physical exam didn’t reveal any immediate concerns. The mild arthritis is what we’d expect, given your history. As for the shots… You're right to be concerned about potential side effects, and it’s good you're asking. Typically, the most common side effects are mild – a little soreness at the injection site, maybe a low-grade fever for a day or two. Serious reactions are very rare. Given your travel plans to Canada and your history, I recommend three vaccinations: an updated COVID-19 booster, a tetanus booster , and an MMR booster to be safe. We may also consider a flu shot, depending on the timing of your trip and the current strains circulating. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Three shots… oh dear. That sounds like a lot. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, though. I just… I don’t like needles. And I worry about getting sick right before my trip. When would I need to get them? And what about… afterwards? Can I still travel?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Karry. It’s perfectly normal to not like needles, and it's smart to think about potential side effects and travel plans. We can spread them out if you’d prefer, although getting them all at once is the most efficient. Typically, we recommend getting the COVID-19 booster and the tetanus booster at least two weeks before your trip to allow your body time to develop immunity. The MMR booster takes a bit longer, about a month, so we might consider spacing that one out a bit. As for afterwards, you might feel a little under the weather for a day or two – mild fever, muscle aches – but it shouldn’t be anything serious. You should still be able to travel, but it’s best to avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. We'll also provide you with a record of the vaccinations for your travel documentation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That… does sound a bit better, spreading them out. Perhaps the tetanus one first, then the COVID one, and then the other one later? I just… I want to be prepared. What’s involved with each shot? Like, how big are the needles? And… is it painful? Please don't laugh. I know it sounds silly.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Karry. It’s perfectly reasonable to ask. We want you to feel comfortable and prepared. The needles are quite small, actually – about the size of a thin sewing needle. You might feel a quick pinch or sting, but it shouldn't be overly painful. We can also use a numbing spray if you’d like, to minimize discomfort. The tetanus booster is just one injection in your upper arm. The COVID-19 booster is also one injection, usually in the same arm. The MMR booster is given as a subcutaneous injection, meaning it goes just under the skin, and sometimes causes a little more tenderness than the others. We’ll be sure to talk through each step before we do it, and I’ll let you know when you’re done. How about we schedule the tetanus booster for next week, and then we can discuss the other two after that?
PATIENT: Next week sounds… manageable. Yes, let's do that. I suppose it’s best to get started. What day is good for you? And… where exactly will it be given? Is there anything I should do to prepare? Like, should I eat something beforehand? Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. I'm happy to help. I have availability next Tuesday afternoon, or Thursday morning. Either one would work. The injection will be given in your upper arm, in the deltoid muscle. It’s best to eat a light meal beforehand – nothing too heavy – and make sure you’re well-hydrated. You can also take a pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen afterwards, if you’re feeling sore. Just let the nurse know if you have any allergies or medical conditions. I'll have the nurse schedule you for next Tuesday at 2:30 pm. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 2:30 works perfectly. Thank you so much, Doctor. I feel a lot better now, knowing what to expect. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I really do. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Karry. I’m glad I could help. We’ll see you next Tuesday. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, and please enjoy your visit with your grandchildren!
