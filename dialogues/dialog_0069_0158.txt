DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, is it? Yes, yes… well, it’s about a letter. A letter for my… companion. You see, they want a letter saying I own him, or something. It's all rather silly, if you ask me. People these days... needing proof for everything. It’s for the housing people, I think? My daughter handled most of it, honestly. I just… need the letter.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wrye. So, to clarify, you're needing a letter stating… your relationship to your companion, for housing purposes?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s it. A relationship… and that I’m responsible for him. He’s a lovely boy, really. A bit… unusual looking, perhaps, but very well-behaved. Though, he does shed everywhere. Honestly, it’s a nightmare. But a good boy. They just want proof, you know? Like I haven’t got better things to do than explain about… him.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand you need documentation for housing. Could you tell me a little more about this companion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, he's… a large lizard. A very large lizard. From… somewhere in Africa, I believe. My ex-husband brought him back. Said he “rescued” him. Honestly, the man didn’t have a sensible bone in his body. Anyway, he’s quite affectionate, really. Likes to sit on the sofa and watch television with me. But as I said, the shedding! It’s awful. And he eats a lot of insects. Honestly, the smell sometimes...
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, thank you for sharing that with me. While I appreciate you coming to me for this documentation, I’m a medical doctor specializing in internal medicine. Providing a letter stating your relationship to a… reptile isn’t within my area of expertise or ethical guidelines. It's important that any documentation is legally sound and accurate, and I'm not qualified to assess that in this situation.
PATIENT: Oh, now you tell me! Honestly, the things they make you jump through these days. My daughter said a doctor could write it. She said it needed to be official. I don’t understand why it’s so difficult! It’s just a letter! Is there someone else here who can do it? A nurse, perhaps? I really haven’t got time for all this fuss. And he is a lovely lizard, you know. Very well-behaved for a reptile.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any confusion. You're right, it should be straightforward. However, this requires specific legal knowledge and documentation procedures that I’m not equipped to provide. I wouldn't want to provide something that isn't legally sound and could cause issues for your housing application. Unfortunately, we don’t have anyone here who is qualified to write such a document. I would recommend contacting a legal professional – a lawyer or a paralegal – who specializes in animal ownership or tenant rights. They would be best equipped to assist you and ensure the documentation meets the necessary requirements. Would you like me to help you find some resources for local legal assistance?
PATIENT: A lawyer? Honestly! For a lizard? This is ridiculous. My daughter is going to be furious. She said a simple letter from a doctor would be enough. But… alright. If you insist. I suppose a lawyer is better than nothing. Do you have a number for… a nice one? Someone who won’t laugh at me? And please, don’t make me explain about the shedding again. It's quite embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I understand your concerns. I have a list of local legal resources here. Let me find a few that specialize in animal law or tenant rights – and I assure you, they will be professionals and won't judge. Here’s a number for Peterson & Associates. They have experience with animal ownership cases, and their website says they offer free initial consultations. The number is 555-123-4567. I can also email you a link to their website if you’d like?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… helpful, thank you. Peterson & Associates… 555-123-4567. Yes, email the link, please. My daughter is very good with computers. She can sort it all out. I just… wanted to get this done. It’s a bother, really. But thank you, Doctor. I suppose. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I’m glad I could provide some resources for you. I've emailed you the link. If you have any other health concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, and I hope everything works out with the housing application. .
