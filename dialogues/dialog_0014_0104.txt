DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? It’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a bit now. I really don't have time for this, if you don't mind. Just need to know what it is and how to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. A sore throat, you said. "A bit now"... can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t do specific. It started… sometime last week, I think. Maybe earlier. It’s just a pain. Like… when you have a cold, but maybe not as bad. I work with machines all day, very noisy machines. Perhaps it's from shouting over the noise? It’s hard to say. I don’t remember exactly when it started. Really. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "sometime last week" isn't terribly helpful, but we'll work with it. You mentioned working with noisy machines… Do you feel like it’s worse after a long day at work?
PATIENT: Of course it’s worse after work! Everything is worse after work. I’m tired. My throat is tired. My whole body is tired. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I don’t see what that has to do with anything. It hurts when I swallow. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, pain on swallowing. And just to be clear, this pain is only when you swallow?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn’t feel good, does it? Of course it’s only when I swallow! What would it be, Doctor, pain when I think about swallowing? Honestly. It’s a very straightforward problem, I assure you. I'm a practical woman. Just tell me what pill I need.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I understand you want a quick answer. But even "straightforward problems" need some information. Have you had a fever, any chills, or a cough?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? No. Cough? Maybe a little, but that’s just the dust from the factory. Everything is dusty. Honestly, Doctor, I don't spend my time taking my temperature. I have work to do. And a life, or what's left of it since my husband… well, never mind. Look, just… is it something serious? Will I need to take time off? Because I can’t afford to.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, cough from dust. I understand your concerns about time off. Let’s just take a quick look at your throat. Open wide, please. And try to relax. Hmm. There's some redness and a little swelling back there. Nothing terribly alarming, but it's definitely inflamed. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, Doctor, who doesn't have allergies these days? Dust, probably. And maybe… pollen? I don't keep track of such things. My husband used to handle all that. Honestly, it’s probably just a bit of a cold. Can we please be done now? I have a schedule to keep. And I really don’t like having things poked around in my mouth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dust and pollen. And no known drug allergies?
PATIENT: No. Never taken anything stronger than a painkiller for a headache. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, truly, but I have very little time. Can you just prescribe something and be done with it? I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Just a bit of irritation. A simple fix. Please.
DOCTOR: Tammie, I understand you're busy and want a quick solution. However, prescribing medication without a clearer picture of what’s going on wouldn’t be responsible. It could be something simple, like a viral infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Doctor, I’m standing here, aren’t I? Of course I’m not having difficulty breathing! And swallowing? I just told you it hurts! That's why I’m here! Honestly, are you even listening to me? This is getting ridiculous. Just give me an antibiotic, or whatever you think is best, and let me go. I have a factory to run, you know. People depend on me. I really don't have time for this interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Given your insistence and the lack of other symptoms, I can tentatively diagnose this as pharyngitis, likely viral. However, because you are uninsured, and I don’t have a way to easily follow up to confirm this improves, I'm going to recommend you see a specialist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I can give you a prescription for a symptomatic treatment – a throat lozenge and a pain reliever. But I strongly advise you to get this checked out by someone who can do a rapid strep test and rule out other possibilities. I'll give you a referral to a low-cost clinic nearby. Here you go. And please, if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
