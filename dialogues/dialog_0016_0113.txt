DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Segretto is the name. Honestly, it’s… well, it’s the bladder, I suppose. Been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, that is. It's a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, I don't think, but my wife insisted I get it checked. Women, always worrying.
DOCTOR: It’s good of you to come in, even if it was at your wife’s insistence! It’s always best to get these things checked out. Frequent urination can have several causes, and it’s good we’re getting a handle on it now. So, when you say “a lot,” can you give me a rough idea of how often you’re going?
PATIENT: Rough idea… hmm. Well, I used to go, you know, normal times. Maybe four, five times a day? Now… I don't know… seven, eight maybe? Could be more. I lose track, honestly. I’m not one for counting trips to the bathroom. Used to have more important things to worry about, running the farm and all. Don't keep track of such things these days. It's mostly at night that bothers me, though. Waking up a couple times… sometimes more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an increase from around four or five times a day to seven or eight, with nighttime trips being particularly bothersome. That gives me a good starting point. And is it a full bladder each time, or just a little bit?
PATIENT: Full bladder… mostly full. Not always bursting, mind you. Sometimes it's just… a little something. Feels like I can't quite empty it all, either. Like there's always a little left in there. It's a strange feeling. Used to be able to, you know, completely empty. Body doesn't work like it used to, I suppose. Getting old, that's all. Is that what causes it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be related to age, Mr. Segretto, but there are several possibilities we need to consider. Not being able to fully empty your bladder is definitely something we want to investigate. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little discomfort sometimes, a bit of a… strain, maybe. But not pain. And no burning, no. It just… feels like it takes a bit longer, and like I'm not getting everything out. And sometimes, you know, it's just… a sudden urge. Gotta go right now, even if there isn't much in there. It's a bit embarrassing, truthfully. Used to have much better control. Everything's slipping, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or burning, but some strain and a feeling of incomplete emptying. And you're experiencing a sudden, urgent need to urinate. That's helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Now you're asking something. Let me think. It looks… normal, I suppose. Usual color, nothing cloudy or anything. Haven't seen any blood, thank goodness. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to my… output, if you don't mind me saying. I just go when I need to go. My wife's the one who notices these things, usually. Always keeping an eye on everything. She would probably know better than me if there was anything different.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. It’s good to have someone looking out for you. And it’s common for people not to pay close attention to these details. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any past medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I used to be a pretty healthy fella, always working hard on the farm. Had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been alright ever since. Nothing major, nothing serious. I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy, if that counts. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Worked too hard all my life, that's what it is. Don’t think I’ve ever been in a hospital for anything else. My wife handles all the appointments and remembers all the details. I’m not always the best at keeping track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and an appendectomy in your youth. No other major medical issues. And you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. Little white pills. Take 'em every morning with my breakfast. Can't remember the name of 'em, truthfully. My wife gets 'em filled and keeps 'em organized. I just take 'em. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Keeps me going, keeps everything running smoothly. Can't imagine life without her. It's been… a long time, you know? A good life, mostly. Just this bladder thing is a bit of a nuisance.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had a very full life, Mr. Segretto. And it’s wonderful you have your wife to help manage things. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No, I don't think so. Appendectomy was when I was a boy. Maybe some minor things, you know, skin tags removed or something like that, but nothing major. Never had any big operations. My wife would definitely know if I did, she remembers everything. She'd never let me forget it. Always saying I need to take better care of myself, but I was always too busy working. A farmer's life is a hard life, Doctor. No time for fussing over things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major surgeries besides the appendectomy. Now, thinking about your family, do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father had some trouble with his heart when he got older, I think. Had to slow down a lot, couldn’t work the land anymore. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad joints. Couldn't move around much when she got old. Besides that… not that I recall. We weren't really ones for talking about medical things. It was a different time, you know? You just dealt with things, didn't make a fuss. My wife might know more, she's the one who keeps track of all that family history stuff. She's a real researcher, that wife of mine. Always digging around, finding out things. A good woman, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble and arthritis. And you said your wife does a lot of family history research, that's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it didn't do him any good. So, no, never smoked. As for drinking… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, back when I was younger. A light beer, nothing strong. But I haven't had a drink in years. Doctor told me to cut back, said it wasn't good for my blood pressure. So, I stopped. Mostly drink water these days. Keeps me hydrated, my wife says. She's always looking out for me, that woman. A good woman, truly. Hard worker, too. Runs this whole place.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking and you used to drink light beer, but have stopped for health reasons. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with medications. Sometimes I get a bit of a rash if I brush up against poison ivy, but that's about it. Nothing serious. My wife always checks with the pharmacist when she gets a new prescription, just to be safe. She’s very careful, that woman. A good woman, truly. Keeps me out of trouble. I'd be lost without her, I tell ya. Always thinking ahead, always making sure everything's alright. She's a real lifesaver.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medication allergies, just a mild reaction to poison ivy. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Segretto, I think I have a good understanding of your medical history and current situation. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… well, alright. I suppose so. Haven't had one in a while, but I guess it's a good idea. Just don't poke around too much, alright? Getting old, bones are a bit creaky. And try not to take too long, I've got things to do. But yes, go ahead. As long as it doesn't take too long. My wife will be wondering where I am. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Always keeping me on schedule.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. We’ll take it easy. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. It shouldn't take long at all. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. Sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, which is common with age. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Abdomen… hmm. No, not really. A little bit of… discomfort, maybe, when you press down low. But nothing painful. Just a bit tender. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, so maybe it's that. Old age, you know? Everything starts to ache and groan. Just don't poke around too hard, alright? And try to be quick, my wife will be wondering where I am. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Always keeping me on schedule. She'd have my hide if I was gone too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some slight tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you mentioned. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is also common with age. Now, I'm just going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me. Gait is stable, a little bit slow, but nothing concerning. Alright, Mr. Segretto, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems normal overall, but the slight tenderness in your lower abdomen and your urinary symptoms warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urinalysis and blood test… hmm. Sounds alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. Don't want to be gone too long, my wife will be wondering where I am. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Always keeping me on schedule. She'd have my hide if I was gone too long. And try to make it quick, alright? I've got things to do. Running the farm doesn't just happen on its own, you know. Used to be able to do it all myself, but now… well, getting old. But yes, go ahead with the tests. As long as it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It should only take a few minutes. In the meantime, I’ll go over some possible causes for your symptoms. Frequent urination, especially at night, can be caused by several things, including an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age, a urinary tract infection, or even just changes in bladder function. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Enlarged… what was it? Prostate? Is that serious, Doctor? My wife never mentioned anything about that. She usually tells me these things. And infection… I don't feel sick, you know? Just gotta go to the bathroom a lot. I suppose that's alright. As long as it's nothing serious. And you're sure it won't take too long? My wife will be wondering where I am. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Always keeping me on schedule. She’d have my hide if I was gone too long. No, I don’t think I have any more questions. Just get it done quickly, alright?
DOCTOR: An enlarged prostate, also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It's not cancer, and it's usually not serious, but it can cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting and stopping urination, and a weak stream. We'll get the tests done to see if that could be the cause. And as for the infection, you don't always feel sick with a urinary tract infection, especially if it's mild. That's why it's important to rule it out. The tests shouldn’t take too long at all. The nurse should be with you shortly. And to reiterate, the nurse will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, I’ll leave you with some printed materials on BPH and UTIs. Please read through them, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask the nurse or me. We’ll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Printed materials… hmm. I suppose that's alright. But I don't read too well these days, eyesight's not what it used to be. My wife usually reads these things to me. But yes, go ahead. As long as it doesn't take too long. I've got things to do, you know. Running the farm doesn't just happen on its own. And my wife will be wondering where I am. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Always keeping me on schedule. Always keeping me on schedule. She'd have my hide if I was gone too long. Yes, just get it done quickly, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I’ll make sure the nurse explains everything to you and your wife in detail. We'll make sure you both understand the results and the next steps. The nurse will be in shortly. I'll leave you to it then. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Just get it done quickly, alright? My wife will be wondering where I am. She's a good woman, that wife of mine. Always keeping me on schedule. Always keeping me on schedule. She'd have my hide if I was gone too long.
