DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…the swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s in my…leg, mostly. It’s been getting bigger. Not fast, but…bigger. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. "After the cancer," you say. And the swelling is primarily in one leg?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly the right one. It feels…heavy, sometimes. And a little sore, if I stand too long. Not bad sore, just…there. Is that making sense? I'm not very good with explaining things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Queener. Heavy and sore with prolonged standing. And you said this swelling has been gradually increasing after cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. After. It didn't start during. The treatment finished…oh, let me think…last November, I think? Maybe October? It's hard to remember dates, you know. But it definitely wasn't while I was getting things done. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s…helpful. And what type of cancer treatment did you receive, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh! Um…chemotherapy, mostly. And some…radiation? Yes, radiation too. It was at the hospital, of course. I don't remember all the names of the things, I just…went when they told me to. Is it important what kind of chemo?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Queener. Different chemotherapy agents have different potential long-term effects. Do you recall if they discussed the specific names of the drugs with you, or perhaps you have a discharge summary from your oncology care?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I…probably have something at home. Lots of papers. My daughter helps me with things like that. I don't remember the names, no. They just…gave me the medicine. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful! It was a long time ago and…a lot to take in. Can't we just look at the leg? Maybe you can see what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with a physical examination. Please have a seat on the exam table, and I’ll take a look. I need to assess the extent of the swelling, check for any skin changes, and feel for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. It might be a little red, sometimes. But not always. And like I said, it gets heavier as the day goes on. I hope it's not too bad. I just want to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. I do observe some mild erythema, as you mentioned, on the lower right leg. And I’m going to measure the circumference of both legs at the widest points to assess the degree of swelling. Right leg measures 38 centimeters, left leg is 35 centimeters. A three-centimeter difference. Now, I’m going to palpate the leg to check for tenderness or any masses. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Hmm…a little. There. Not sharp pain, just…a dull ache when you push. Like a bruise, maybe? It feels…tight there, too. Is that normal? I just don’t want it to be…serious.
DOCTOR: I do feel some firmness in that area, Ms. Queener, and you are correct, there is mild tenderness to palpation. I'm also listening for any abnormal sounds to assess the blood flow in the leg. Blood flow appears normal. Now, I'm going to check the pulses in your feet. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. This examination suggests possible lymphedema, potentially related to your previous cancer treatment. However, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Lymp-what-ema? Is that…bad? I don't even know what that is. Is it something I need…medicine for? Or surgery? Oh dear. I’m getting worried now.
DOCTOR: Lymphedema is a swelling caused by a buildup of lymph fluid. It can occur after cancer treatment, especially if lymph nodes were removed or damaged. It’s not necessarily serious immediately, but it can become chronic if left unmanaged. It can cause discomfort and, in some cases, skin infections. We'll need to confirm this with a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow and lymph drainage in your leg. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to rule out any infection. Finally, I need you to bring in any discharge summaries from your oncology care. Do you think your daughter can help with that?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Ultrasound sounds…scary. But okay. And blood work. Yes, my daughter can definitely help with the papers. She’s very good at that. She took me to all my appointments, too. Is the ultrasound…painful? And when can I have it done? I just want to get this all sorted.
DOCTOR: It's a non-invasive procedure, Ms. Queener. There is no pain involved, just the application of a gel and a probe to assess the blood flow. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street. I will have my assistant schedule that for you now. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your right leg whenever possible, and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any compression stockings?
PATIENT: Compression…stockings? No, I don’t. I’ve never even heard of them! What do they do? And where would I get them? Oh dear, this is all a lot to take in. Is it something expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. Medicare covers some things, I think...
DOCTOR: Compression stockings help to improve lymph drainage and reduce swelling. They apply gentle pressure to the leg, encouraging fluid to move back towards the heart. They are available at most pharmacies or medical supply stores. Medicare does often cover them with a prescription, but it depends on the diagnosis and your specific plan. I will write you a prescription for compression stockings, and my assistant will help you navigate the coverage options with Medicare. For now, let’s focus on getting the ultrasound scheduled and the blood work done. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, thank you. No, no allergies. Not to anything, as far as I know. I took all sorts of things during the treatment, and I was fine. So, ultrasound tomorrow, and the blood work…where will that be done? At the same place? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor’s appointment next week, and I’d like to know before then.
DOCTOR: The blood work will be done at the lab right here in the clinic. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. My assistant will contact you as soon as they are available. We can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment next week, or sooner if there are any urgent findings. For now, I believe we've covered everything. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if it’s a little…scary. I appreciate you explaining things, and I’m glad I came in. I just hope it’s not too serious. My daughter is meeting me, so…I should go wait in the waiting room.
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will escort you to the waiting room. We’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: .
