DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that’s all. Want to get it over with if we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical, that’s perfectly reasonable. We can certainly get that done for you. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any health problems currently, or is this purely for the insurance requirements?
PATIENT: Nah, no problems. Just… routine stuff, I guess. They just want to make sure I’m not gonna drop dead on ‘em or somethin’. I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: Alright, "mostly alright" is good to hear. A little tired is pretty common these days. We’ll still go through a standard check-up to make sure everything is alright, just to be thorough for the insurance company, and more importantly, for you. I see here you’re Waleed Putney, 49 years old… and your weight is listed as 97 kilograms. And your height is 174 centimeters. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Sounds about right. I ain’t been to the doctor in a while, so I guess that info is… old. Don’t worry too much about it. Let’s just get this done.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. It’s helpful to have a baseline, even if it’s a little outdated. Before we proceed with the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… hmm. Not much, honestly. Had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. As an adult… not much. Had a bad back for a bit a few years ago, but it mostly sorted itself out. No big surgeries, no major illnesses. Why do you need to know all this anyway? Is it gonna take long?
DOCTOR: I ask about your past medical history to get a complete picture of your overall health. It helps me understand if there are any pre-existing conditions that might be relevant, even if they seem minor now. It also helps me determine what kind of tests or screenings might be appropriate. And no, it shouldn’t take long – we’ll keep it as efficient as possible. Okay, so no major surgeries or serious illnesses as an adult, and a childhood history of typical illnesses and a broken arm. Have you been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Not even for the broken arm, just the doctor set it and I wore a cast. Everything healed up okay. Look, I appreciate you asking, but is this all standard stuff for the insurance? 'Cause I got things I gotta do later today.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is standard for the insurance physical, and I apologize if it feels a bit thorough. They want to be quite comprehensive. We're just covering all the bases. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… uh. My mom, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had diabetes, later in life. That's about all I know, really. Nobody really talked about health much when I was growing up. We were more worried about, you know, just getting by. Is that enough? I ain't a doctor, I just know what I remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Putney. Knowing about high blood pressure in your mother and diabetes in your father is helpful. It gives us a bit more information. We don’t need a complete family medical tree – just what you remember is fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. I can eat anything, take anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Can we get on with the actual check-up now? I’m starting to get a little antsy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can get right to the physical exam. Just a few quick questions first. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… sometimes a painkiller for a headache, but that's it. And not even regularly. Really, that’s all. Let's just do it. I need to get outta here.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No regular medications or supplements. Alright, Mr. Putney. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Just… get it over with. I’m ready when you are. I’m gonna stand on the scale, right? And then you poke and prod me? Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ve got it. First, we’ll get your height and weight. Then, yes, a little poking and prodding – it’s all part of the standard check-up. Please step onto the scale for me. And then I'll measure your height. Okay, your height is 174 centimeters, which is about 5 feet 8 inches, and your weight is 97 kilograms – that’s about 214 pounds. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please remove your shirt and I’ll listen with my stethoscope?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here we go. Just...try to be quick, okay? This is kinda awkward.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick as possible. I understand it can be a little awkward, so I’ll keep it brief and professional. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any unusual sounds or wheezing. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit back on the examination table and let your arms relax?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Relaxed. Like this? Just tell me what you want me to do. I’m not used to this doctor stuff, so you gotta be clear. Is everything alright so far? You don't look too worried, so that's a good sign, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is alright so far. Just relax, and I’ll take care of the rest. Okay, your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Please open your mouth and say “Ah.” Okay, your ears and throat look clear. No signs of infection or inflammation. Everything seems normal so far.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. Clear. That's what I wanna hear. So...what now? Are we done? Can I go? I got places to be, you know. Is this enough for the insurance people? Do I need blood tests or anything? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: We're almost done, Mr. Putney. Just a few final questions, and then we'll discuss the results and what, if anything, is needed for the insurance company. First, let me quickly review my findings. Your height and weight are within normal limits for your age. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your reflexes are normal, and your ears and throat are clear. Everything I've examined so far appears normal. To be thorough, and because of your family history of diabetes, I would recommend a basic blood sugar test. It’s just a simple check to make sure everything is alright. It's a routine precaution, given your father’s history. We can do it quickly here in the clinic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test… Ugh. Fine. If you really think it's necessary. But make it quick, okay? And don't poke around too much. I hate needles. Is this gonna take long? I got a fishing trip planned for tomorrow, and I don’t want to be sick. How much is this gonna cost me? I'm on a fixed income, you know. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Putney. It will be quick, I promise. Just a small sample of blood from your arm. And I’ll be as gentle as possible. The blood sugar test shouldn’t take long at all – just a few minutes to draw the sample and then a short wait for the results. It will cost approximately $30. Medicare should cover most of the cost, but there may be a small copay, depending on your plan. We can check with your insurance provider to confirm the exact amount. If you are worried, we can just submit the physical exam results as they are, but the insurance company may request the blood sugar test anyway. What do you think?
PATIENT: Fine. Just do it. Get it over with. $30… alright. But make it quick, and don’t mess it up. I don’t have time for complications. Just… tell me when you’re ready. And try not to be too rough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat and rest your arm on the chair. This might sting for a moment, but it will be over quickly. Just try to relax. Okay, all done. Just keep pressure on the bandage for a few minutes to prevent bruising. Now, while we wait for the results, do you have any questions or concerns for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when do you think you’ll have the results? And will I be able to go fishing tomorrow? That's all I care about. And is there anything I need to do now? Like, avoid certain foods or anything? Just tell me straight. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, the results are back. Your blood sugar level is 98 mg/dL. That’s within the normal range. Everything looks good. You are definitely able to go fishing tomorrow, Mr. Putney! There are no restrictions on your activities. You don’t need to avoid any specific foods or take any special precautions. So, to summarize: your physical exam was normal, and your blood sugar level is within the normal range. Given the results, this should be sufficient for your insurance requirements. I’ll prepare a summary report for them, and you can take a copy for your records. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's it. Finally. That was… a hassle. Just give me the report, and I'll be on my way. Thanks… I guess. Just… try to make things a little easier for the next guy, okay? A lot of us don’t like needles or being poked and prodded. Appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. I understand, and I always strive to make the experience as comfortable as possible. I’m glad everything turned out well. Here’s the report. Feel free to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. And enjoy your fishing trip! Have a good day.
