DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doc. It’s… it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’, see? Not a little bit either. It’s… messy. And frankly, it’s worryin’ me somethin’ fierce. Never had nothin’ like this happen before.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. And you’ve noticed this…recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Oh, yeah. Started maybe… a week ago? Hard to say exactly. I don’t spend a lot of time lookin’ at what comes out, if you catch my drift. But it's gotten worse each day. Darker, more of it. And now I just feel… weak, you know? Like somethin's drainin' me. I don't even have the energy to keep the place tidy anymore, and that's sayin' somethin’.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good you’re addressing it now, rather than later. A week is…significant enough. Can you describe the blood for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean describe it? It's… blood. Red. Dark red now, like I said. Like… used coffee grounds, almost. Honestly, Doc, I'm not a butcher. It’s blood comin' outta me, and it ain’t pretty. Is that what you want to know? I figure you’re the doctor, you tell me what different kinds of blood look like. I just experience it, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. The color and consistency are important indicators, Mr. Gentz. Dark, coffee-ground-like blood, as you put it, suggests… a potential source higher up in the digestive tract. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits alongside this bleeding?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're askin’ questions. Look, I eat, it goes in, it comes out. What’s so complicated about that? I haven't been throwin' up, no. Bowel habits… they're fine, I guess. A little looser than usual, maybe. But I ate a bad gyro last Tuesday, could be that. I ain't a delicate flower, Doc. A little stomach upset ain’t gonna bother me. But this bleedin’… this is different. It's... unnervin’. And frankly, expensive. You know what a roll of paper towels costs these days?
DOCTOR: Right. “A little looser.” And you attribute that to the gyro from last Tuesday?
PATIENT: Well, what else would it be? I had it from that new place down on Elm Street. Figured it was somethin’ I ate. Always been able to handle my food. Never had trouble with indigestion or nothin’ like that. Look, I'm a practical man, Doc. You don’t need to overthink everything. A bad gyro, a little loose stool, bleedin’… it's all connected somehow. Probably just somethin' that’ll pass. Though, if it keeps bleedin’, it’s gonna make a mess of my work. You know how it is. Gotta keep things presentable.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… resilience, Mr. Gentz, dismissing potential internal issues based on a gyro is… inadvisable. Let’s move on. Any previous medical problems, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. Diggin' into the past now, are we? Well, my wife… bless her soul… she passed three years ago. Cancer. Long battle. That’s the big one. Aside from that, I’ve been mostly healthy. A few bad backs from lifting at work, but nothin’ a little ibuprofen couldn’t handle. Never had surgery, never been in the hospital ‘cept for visitin’ her. I ain't a fragile man, Doc. Tough as nails, always been. And frankly, I don't have time for this endless questionin’. You gonna fix me or not? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. However, a thorough history is crucial. Family history, if you please. Any illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Yemenis, see? Lots of folks. My father, he lived to be eighty, mostly healthy. Mother, she had diabetes, passed when I was young. That’s about all I know. They weren't the type to go to doctors. Tough people. Didn't bother with fancy medicine. Believed in… strong constitution, and natural remedies. Honestly, Doc, half the family tree I don't even know. They all scattered, you know? Different countries, different lives. This is gettin' ridiculous. What does any of that have to do with my stomach bleedin'? You're just askin’ questions to justify somethin' expensive, aren’t ya?
DOCTOR: It’s not about justifying expenses, Mr. Gentz. It’s about proper assessment. Now, do you take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just ibuprofen, like I said. When my back flares up. Maybe a couple a week, sometimes none at all. That's it. I don’t go for all that fancy pill-poppin' nonsense. My wife… she was the one who went to doctors, took all sorts of things. Didn't do her any good, in the end. I believe in keepin’ it simple, Doc. Natural. You know? Plain food, plain livin’. And now… this bleedin'. Seems like somethin' ain't right, even if I can't put my finger on it. But I don't need a laundry list of drugs to fix it. That's just… foolishness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical examination then. I need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need to… gently palpate it. I'll also need to check your vitals. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Palpate? What's that even mean? Look, I'm not comfortable with strangers pokin' and proddin' around. And frankly, I’m a bit self-conscious. I ain't been to a doctor in years. And if you're gonna start jabbin' at me, I'm leavin’. I got better things to do than be… examined. You said you could fix me, Doc. Just tell me what’s wrong and give me somethin' for it. This whole thing is a waste of my time, and frankly, makin' me nervous. Just get on with it, if you're gonna get on with it. But no pokin' and proddin', alright? I’m a grown man, not a… a specimen.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, a physical examination is necessary to determine the cause of your bleeding. I assure you, it is a standard procedure and will be conducted professionally. However, if you are unwilling to cooperate, I cannot provide adequate medical care. I understand your apprehension, but your refusal hinders my ability to help you. Now, I will need to check your vital signs at the very least. Please allow me to take your blood pressure and pulse. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood pressure, fine. Pulse, alright. But that’s it. No layin' down, no pokin', no proddin'. You take your numbers, tell me what they mean, and then give me somethin’ for this bleedin’. That's all I'm askin’. I ain't got all day to spend in a doctor’s office. And if you start tryin’ to do somethin’ fancy, I'm walkin' out. Understand? I’m not lookin’ for a full-blown medical investigation here. Just a quick fix. That's all. I got a place to run, and things to get done. So, take your numbers and let’s be quick about it. Honestly, this is gettin' ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the vitals. Please sit still and extend your arm. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. Your pulse is 88 beats per minute. Now, I strongly recommend further evaluation, Mr. Gentz, but I understand your reluctance. Based solely on these vitals and your description, I suspect a potential upper gastrointestinal bleed. However, this is only a preliminary assessment. I recommend a complete blood count and a stool test to confirm. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Complete blood count? Stool test? Now you’re talkin’ about diggin’ through… never mind. Look, Doc, is this bleedin’ serious? Is it gonna kill me? That’s what I need to know. All this fancy talk about counts and tests… it don't mean nothin' to me. Just tell me straight: Am I in danger? And if I am, what’s gonna be done about it? ‘Cause I’m not spendin’ my last days runnin’ around gettin’ poked and prodded for tests. Just tell me what’s happenin’. And if it’s serious, I want the quickest, simplest fix you got. No fancy procedures, alright? I’m a practical man, and I want practical solutions. Now, are you gonna fix me, or am I wastin’ my time?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, your bleeding could be serious. It is not something to be dismissed. While I respect your preference for a… straightforward approach, I cannot provide adequate treatment without proper diagnostic tests. A complete blood count will determine the severity of blood loss. The stool test will check for blood and help identify the source of the bleeding. Based on those results, we can formulate a treatment plan. I will order both tests immediately. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any medications that could irritate your stomach, such as ibuprofen. I also suggest a bland diet and plenty of fluids. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or black, tarry stools, you need to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests, no ibuprofen, bland diet, fluids… and if I start feelin’ like I’m gonna pass out, go to the emergency room. I understand. But what’s gonna happen with these tests? How long will they take? And how much is all this gonna cost me? I ain't got insurance, see? Just tell me straight: What’s the damage? I need to know if I can even afford this before I start jumpin’ through hoops. Honestly, Doc, you're makin' me more nervous than the bleedin’ itself. Just give me a number. A straight, honest number. Then I’ll decide what to do. I’m a practical man, remember? I need to know if this is even feasible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns about the cost. However, providing an accurate estimate without knowing the specific results of the tests is difficult. The complete blood count will likely cost around $80. The stool test, depending on what they analyze for, could be between $100 and $200. These are estimates, and the lab may have additional charges. As for your feeling "like you're gonna pass out", that’s a symptom of significant blood loss and requires immediate attention. I strongly recommend discussing payment options with the clinic’s billing department. They may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. I also suggest exploring options for charitable assistance programs, as they may be able to help cover the costs. However, I cannot guarantee coverage. I’m ordering the tests now. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the receptionist contact you when they are ready. In the meantime, please adhere to the instructions I’ve given you. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… get it done. Get the tests done, get the results, and let me know. I’ll… I’ll figure somethin’ out. Thank you, Doc. For… tryin', anyway. It's just… a lot. I appreciate it. I'll go see about talkin’ to the billing department. Thank you.
