DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s… a bit complicated, to be honest. My, uh, my partner and I… we’re thinking about having a baby. And I thought it was best to… check things first. Before we really start trying, you know? I'm Smith, by the way. It's just… I’m not as young as I used to be, and want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, prudence is… admirable. Though, frankly, at your age, one should be prudent. Smith, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Smith Verrall. And… you’re right. Maybe I should be thinking about this more carefully. It’s just… we’ve talked about it for a while, and now feels… right. But I don’t really know where to begin, with all of this. Is there… things I need to worry about? I don't have any insurance, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Insurance is…always a factor. And, yes, there are considerations. Several. At 66, attempting conception presents… unique challenges. We'll need a thorough history, of course. Have you and your partner consulted with anyone else regarding this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not yet. You’re the first. We haven’t really talked to anyone else. It feels… personal, you know? And a little scary, to be honest. I just… I thought it was best to get a doctor’s opinion first. Before we get too hopeful. Is… is it very difficult? I mean, at my age? I don’t even know what questions to ask, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Difficult is…an understatement. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Hmm. Let me think. I had a bad knee for a while, a long time ago, but that’s been mostly okay for years. And… I think I had high blood pressure once, but it went down with diet and exercise. Nothing major, I don’t think. I try to stay active, walk every day, eat healthy... mostly. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox… but nothing serious. Is that what you mean? I forget a lot of details.
DOCTOR: “Usual childhood things” is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Verrall. We need specifics. Any heart conditions?
PATIENT: Heart… conditions? No, I don’t think so. No one ever told me I had a heart problem. I get a little breathless sometimes when I walk up hills, but I figured that was just because I’m getting older. I’ve never had any tests done on my heart. Would… would I know if I had a heart condition? Should I have been told? I just... I've always been pretty healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: That is precisely the concern, Mr. Verrall. We need to establish a baseline. Have you ever had a physical exam in the last… five years?
PATIENT: Five years… hmm. Let me think. I think… maybe? I went to a walk-in clinic once for a bad cold, but that wasn’t a full exam. Just a quick check of my throat and a prescription. Before that… it’s been a long time, I think. Maybe ten years? It’s hard to remember. I don't usually go to the doctor unless something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, with all due respect, this is… less than ideal. We need to proceed with some basic diagnostic testing. Blood work, an EKG, and potentially a chest X-ray to assess your overall health before even considering this undertaking. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Testing… yes, I understand. That sounds… thorough. Blood work and… an EKG, is that the one with the stickers on your chest? And a chest X-ray. Okay. But… how much will all of that cost? I really don't have any money set aside for things like this, and I don’t have insurance, like I said. Will there be a way to… pay it off, maybe? I want to do this, but I don't want to get into trouble financially.
DOCTOR: The cost…will depend on the lab. I can write you a referral to the clinic’s lab, and they may have a payment plan. However, I cannot guarantee affordability. Realistically, given your age and lack of prior care, these tests are essential. We are talking about potentially jeopardizing your health, and that of… your partner. The financial aspect, while unfortunate, must be addressed separately. I will have the nurse provide you with information regarding the lab's financial assistance options. Now, regarding your partner – does she have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I understand. I'll talk to the lab, see what they can do. Thank you. My partner… she’s pretty healthy, as far as I know. She’s a little older than me, maybe 70? She has some arthritis in her hands, makes it hard for her to do some things, but… nothing serious. She goes to the doctor regularly for that, gets some injections. She doesn’t have any major health problems, I don’t think. She's always been strong. She... she hasn't talked to her doctor about this yet, though. She wanted me to come first.
DOCTOR: Arthritis is…not ideal, but manageable. We will need her medical records as well. I will need her to schedule an appointment with me as soon as possible. The nurse will contact both of you to coordinate. Given her age and your own…limited medical history, this process will require significant oversight. Now, before we proceed any further, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I take penicillin, but that was a long time ago, when I was a kid. It wasn't very serious. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital, or anything like that. But… I guess I haven’t taken a lot of medication in my life. Just over-the-counter stuff for colds and aches. I'm not sure if that counts.
DOCTOR: A mild reaction to penicillin is… sufficient to note. We will avoid penicillin-based antibiotics, naturally. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, Doctor. I never have. Never liked it. Tried it once when I was young, but it made me cough too much. My partner doesn’t smoke either. We both try to stay healthy. Fresh air and walking, that's what we believe in. Does that… matter? Is that important? I’m just trying to answer your questions as best as I can. It's a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: It is...relevant. Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, we have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one glass. Maybe a couple on special occasions. Nothing heavy. We don't drink every day. It's just… a little something to relax with. My partner has one too, usually. Nothing more than that. I don’t think it does any harm.
DOCTOR: Very well. One glass of wine…occasionally. Now, let's proceed. The nurse will schedule both you and your partner for comprehensive physical examinations, blood work, and an EKG. Please understand that this is a preliminary assessment and further testing may be required. I trust you both appreciate the gravity of this undertaking. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. You’ve covered a lot. It sounds… complicated, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I guess we’ll just wait for the nurse to call and schedule the appointments. I hope everything will be alright. I just… we really want this to work. But I understand it might not be possible. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Prudence is key, Mr. Verrall. The nurse will be in shortly. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if any concerns arise. .
