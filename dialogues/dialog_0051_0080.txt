DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s not really for anything, if that makes sense. Just need some forms filled out. Medicare sent a notice saying I needed to come in and get some things done.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sometimes Medicare requires a check-up to update records, even if you're feeling well. It's good you came in to take care of it. Let's get that taken care of then. Just to be thorough, even though you say it's just for forms, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Overall… I’d say pretty good. I work out on the reservation pretty regularly, mostly just walking and helping with things around the place, you know? Nothing major. No big health problems that I know of. I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't, right? My husband usually worries more about me than I do.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you’re active and feeling generally well. It’s always nice when we have a supportive partner. And it's very common to feel tired, especially with an active lifestyle. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about that tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like… sick tired. More just… at the end of the day, I’m done. Like, really done. I sit down and I stay down, if you know what I mean. It used to not be so bad, but it’s been getting a little worse over the last few months, maybe? Not enough to stop doing things, but enough to notice. And sometimes, first thing in the morning, it takes a while to really wake up. It's probably just getting older, though. I'm 35, that’s… something, right?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're noticing these changes, and it's definitely worth exploring, even if it is just a normal part of life. A gradual increase in fatigue, especially with morning sluggishness, can have a lot of different causes. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve been to the tribal doctor a few times for check-ups, and he always said I was healthy as a horse. Mostly just aches and pains from working, you know? Nothing serious ever came up. I don't really go to doctors much unless I have to. My husband, he goes more often. He worries about everything. He’s the one with the medical cards and stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And it’s understandable to only see a doctor when needed. Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. And no surgeries either. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That was it. I’m pretty careful now, mostly. My husband still tells everyone about that broken arm, though. Like I'm a menace to society.
DOCTOR: Sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate. No surgeries or hospitalizations, just a childhood mishap. Alright, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom’s side, there was some heart trouble, I think. Her dad, my grandpa, he had a bad heart. And my aunt, on my dad’s side, she had… something with sugar, maybe diabetes? It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. Nobody really did. Mostly just, “Old Man So-and-So wasn’t feeling well.” That’s about all I can remember, honestly. It wasn't something we kept track of, you know? It just… was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble on your mother’s side and possible diabetes on your father’s side. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your lifestyle – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband drinks a beer sometimes, watching the game, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. We don't go for any of that. Raised better than that. We like our quiet life, you know? Walking, helping the community… that’s enough for us.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. A healthy lifestyle is very important. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes I get a little heartburn, but that’s just from spicy food. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. I'm starting to think I should be a test subject for something!
DOCTOR: Well, that's all very helpful information, Thyra. It sounds like you're generally very healthy, and that's wonderful. Now, just to complete the check-up and get a better understanding of what might be causing your fatigue, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get these forms filled out so Medicare stops sending me notices. I trust you, Dr. Glazewski.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam. If you could please have a seat here, we'll get started. Your blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent. Your pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6, and your weight is 70 kilograms. That's a healthy weight for your height. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, clicks, or rubs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. No focal neurological deficits noted. Everything sounds good so far, physically. Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to order some basic bloodwork. It will help us rule out things like anemia, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Glazewski. I just want to figure out why I’m so tired all the time. Bloodwork sounds fine. Will I have to come back for the results, or…?
DOCTOR: Good. We'll send you to the lab right down the hall. They'll draw a small sample of blood. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once they're available, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, or any other concerns – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… thank you, Dr. Glazewski. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me. I appreciate it. I’m glad I came in. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. I’m glad you came in as well. It’s my pleasure. We’ll get those bloodwork results back to you as quickly as possible. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the meantime. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment now. Have a good day, and take care.
