DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. I just… don’t seem to be able to keep much down these days, and I get full awful quick. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Time just… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for things to feel a bit blurry as time goes on. So, you've been experiencing nausea and feeling full quickly… and you said “a little while now”?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A little while. Maybe… a couple of months? It’s hard to say for sure. It comes and goes, but it's been more often lately. It’s just… uncomfortable, mostly. And worrying, I suppose. I don't remember feeling this way before, not like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. More frequent over the last couple of months. And you describe it as uncomfortable and worrying. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes, or does it happen randomly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so, not really. I try to eat light, you know? Nothing too heavy. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat, honestly. Soup, a little piece of chicken… doesn't make a difference. And it happens at all times of the day. I haven’t noticed a pattern. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not related to specific foods or times of day. And you said you’re already eating light meals. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea and fullness?
PATIENT: Let me think… other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… sometimes my stomach just… aches. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And… oh, I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't really been weighing myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. So tiredness, a dull stomach ache, and some unintentional weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowels? Oh dear. Well… I haven’t been as… regular, I suppose. Not like I used to be. More…constipated, I think is the word. It’s… not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you experienced any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes! A little bit of heartburn, especially after I lie down for a bit. Not awful, but… noticeable. And that burning feeling… sometimes it just creeps up on me. It doesn't happen every time, though. It's just… there when it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional heartburn. Ms. Kelder, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. A long time ago, now. And… oh, and I was told I had high blood pressure once, but I've been taking medicine for that for… well, for a good while. I can’t remember the name of it, though. And… I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, hypertension managed with medication, and a previous bout of pneumonia. Do you know what medications you are currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. I have so many little bottles. Let me see… Here it is... Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. And… something for my arthritis in my hands, but I can't recall the name of that one either. It's a little white pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure. And a white pill for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything. I used to help my grandmother gather wild plants, you know, and I never had any trouble with those. I think I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think... Hmm... No, I don't believe so. Just the gallbladder. And... oh! I had a hysterectomy a long, long time ago, when I was young. But that was… so long ago, I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Alright, hysterectomy and gallbladder removal. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... that's a tricky one. My mother… she had a little bit of everything, I think. High blood pressure, like me. And she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. My father… he was strong as an ox, always working outdoors. Didn't seem to have much trouble with illness. But my grandmother… on my mother’s side… she had something… a sickness, I think. But I don't remember what it was. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of hypertension and heart problems on your mother’s side. And an unspecified illness in your maternal grandmother. Finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked for a while, but I always told him to do it outside. And I barely drink any alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking or heavy alcohol use. Now, Ms. Kelder, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle with my hands, if you could. My arthritis acts up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, but I do note a slightly rapid heart rate. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. I notice some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpated. And now, I will check your hands. I observe some mild swelling and limited range of motion in your finger joints, consistent with arthritis.
PATIENT: Alright… that didn't feel too bad. My hands do ache a bit, you're right. So, what do you think, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kelder, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. The nausea, early satiety, weight loss, constipation, and tenderness in your upper abdomen are concerning. Your rapid heart rate also needs to be investigated. Several possibilities come to mind. It could be something relatively benign like gastritis, or it could be something more serious. Given your age and symptoms, I want to rule out any potential issues with your gallbladder, even though you had it removed previously. Sometimes complications can arise, and it’s also important to rule out any issues with your stomach or intestines. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and liver function tests. I also recommend a stool sample to check for any infections or abnormalities. Finally, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be beneficial to get a clearer picture of your internal organs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of tests. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. That sounds alright. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t like feeling this way. So, yes. Let’s do the tests. Will they… will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your apprehension, Ms. Kelder. The blood work is a standard procedure and should only cause minimal discomfort – just a brief pinch when the needle is inserted. The stool sample will require you to collect a small amount of stool – the lab will provide you with detailed instructions on how to do this. The CT scan is painless but does involve lying still for a short period of time. As for the results, the blood work should be back within a few days, and the CT scan results typically take a bit longer – usually around 3 to 5 business days. Once I have all the results, I will contact you immediately to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat light meals, staying hydrated, and avoiding any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen significantly – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Light meals, stay hydrated… and go to the emergency room if it gets really bad. And you’ll call me as soon as the results come back? That’s good. I appreciate that, Doctor. It just… it's nice to know someone is looking into it. I've been feeling a bit lost, to be honest. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I understand how unsettling it can be when you’re not feeling well and don’t know what’s going on. That’s why I’m here. I will call you as soon as the results are available. My nurse will also schedule the blood work and CT scan for you before you leave today. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I think I'm good for now. Just… thank you again. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. You take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to get everything scheduled for you.
