DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I’m here about… getting some help to stay healthy. My friend mentioned something about a pill you can take, to prevent… well, to prevent getting sick. I don’t know all the details, and honestly, I’d like to get this sorted quickly if possible. I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I understand wanting to stay on top of things. It sounds like you’re referring to preventative medications, which is a very proactive approach to healthcare. To best advise you, could you tell me a little more about what "getting sick" means to you?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, my friend, Fatima, she mentioned something about HIV. She said it’s… easily spread, and there’s a pill you can take before you get it, if you’re… at risk. I don’t… I don’t really talk about things like that with just anyone, so I haven’t asked a lot of questions. But Fatima said you could help, and she’s usually right about these things. Does that make sense? I’m just trying to be careful, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Helaina. You're referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, for HIV prevention. It’s excellent that you’re taking this step to protect your health, and Fatima is correct, we can certainly discuss this. Before we proceed, I do want to assure you that everything we discuss will be kept confidential. It's important we have an open and honest conversation so I can determine if PrEP is right for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Oh dear… I haven’t really thought about it like that. I’m single, haven’t been with anyone regularly for… a long time, honestly. But I do go on dates sometimes, and… well, you never really know, do you? I try to be careful, always use protection if… things go that far. I just want to be prepared, you know? Is that enough information? I'm not very good at this sort of thing. I've mostly just been… lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Helaina. It’s not something everyone thinks about regularly, and it’s good you’re considering it now. Any sexual activity carries some level of risk, and it's responsible of you to be proactive. To help me assess your risk a little more specifically, could you tell me about the types of sexual activity you engage in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, mostly just… kissing, holding hands, that sort of thing. If I go on a date and things are going well, it could lead to… intimacy. But I haven’t been with anyone in a while, so it’s not like it’s a frequent thing. I guess I should be more specific, but… it feels a bit personal. I've never had to talk about this with a doctor before. Is it really necessary to go into that much detail? I just want a pill that makes me feel safer.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Helaina, and I apologize if I’m pressing too much. You are absolutely right to feel that this is personal, and I want to assure you I only ask these questions to provide you with the best possible care. We can certainly discuss general risk factors if you prefer. However, to determine if PrEP is appropriate, we do need to understand the potential for exposure. Could you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection ?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been very careful, as I said. I haven't even had a cold in years! I’m usually very healthy. I… honestly, I’m a little offended you’re asking if I’ve had an STI. It implies… well, never mind. It’s just… it feels like you don’t believe me when I say I’m careful. But no, I’ve never been tested for anything, and I’ve never had any issues. Can we just move on to the pill? I’m really starting to feel anxious about all these questions.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Helaina. That was not my intention at all, and I understand why you’re feeling anxious and offended. You are right to feel that way, and I should have been more sensitive. My apologies for making you feel that way. Let’s absolutely move on. Before we discuss the medication itself, it’s important to do a quick check-up to ensure PrEP is safe for you. This involves a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any existing HIV infection, and also a screening for other STIs. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… reasonable. I suppose if it's necessary to make sure I’m healthy enough for the pill, I’m okay with it. But please, no more questions about my… personal life. Just tell me what I need to do for the blood test. And how quickly can I get the pill after the test? I really want to get this sorted today, if possible. I have a date next week, and… well, it would be nice to feel a little less stressed about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I completely understand. No further personal questions, I promise. Okay, so we’ll just need a small blood sample. It will be sent to the lab, and the results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can discuss the medication options. PrEP is taken as a daily pill, or as an on-demand regimen, depending on your individual needs and risk factors. I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in and draw the blood now. She's very gentle and will explain the process to you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Maria sounds lovely. Two to three business days… that’s a bit long, but I suppose I can wait. As long as I know everything is being taken care of, and I can get the pill soon after. Thank you, Doctor. And please, tell Maria I appreciate her gentleness. I… I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I’ll let Maria know. I understand your apprehension about needles, and she will be very careful. I’ll leave you with Maria now. Please don't hesitate to let me or her know if you have any questions or concerns.
