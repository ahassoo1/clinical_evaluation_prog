DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my speech. It’s been… a bit off, lately. I wouldn’t say bad, exactly… just… slurred, sometimes. It’s hard to explain. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, "a bit off" and sometimes slurred. That’s helpful to know. It’s perfectly alright if you don't have an exact date – sometimes these things creep up on us. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… I think it’s more noticeable when I’m… tired, maybe? Or if I’ve been talking for a long time. It doesn't happen all the time, though. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal. It’s just… inconsistent, I suppose. My husband mentioned it a few times, but I didn’t pay much attention at first.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more noticeable with fatigue or extended talking, but inconsistent overall. And your husband has noticed it as well. That’s good information. Can you describe what it feels like when it's happening?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to describe. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It just feels like… my tongue is a bit heavy, maybe? And the words don’t come out as clearly as they should. Like I’m trying to say something, but it’s… muffled, or slow. Does that make sense? I apologize if I’m not being very clear. It's hard to explain what it feels like to me.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Adyn. You’re describing it very well. “Heavy tongue” and “muffled” are helpful terms. It sounds frustrating. Let's try to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the speech changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think carefully… I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I work a pretty demanding job, so I just assumed it was that. Nothing else comes to mind immediately, no. No headaches, no dizziness… just the tiredness and the speech. I did have a bit of a cold a few weeks ago, but I’ve fully recovered from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and a recent cold that you've recovered from. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask some general health questions, if that's alright. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Let me see… I don't really have any major medical conditions, thankfully. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, and I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. I'm generally quite healthy, I believe. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. My husband handles most of the paperwork, so I don’t always know the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child, broken arm, and generally healthy. Medicare is good to know for billing. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils and arm?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Just the tonsils and the arm, as far as I can remember. My husband might know if I’m forgetting something, but I’m pretty sure that’s it. He usually reminds me of appointments and things like that, so if there was anything else, he’d probably mention it. I'm married, as I said before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. That’s good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don't really know much about her medical history. My father is still alive, but he doesn’t really talk about those things. I know he had high blood pressure, but I don’t know if there’s anything else. I don’t have any siblings, so there’s no one else to ask. I apologize for not being much help with that. It’s not something we discuss much in my family.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Adyn. It's completely understandable. Family history can be difficult to gather. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I work in construction management, and I need to be clear-headed and focused on the job. It’s very important to me to stay healthy and responsible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so non-smoker, very minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That’s good to know. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I've taken various medications over the years for minor things like colds and headaches, but I’ve never had any problems. I don’t wear any jewelry, so I don’t have any metal allergies either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s all very helpful information, Adyn. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your neurological function, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 122/78, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll test your strength and reflexes. Cranial nerves are intact. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear. Nose is clear. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Tongue is midline and without fasciculations. Everything looks normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring. However, the intermittent slurred speech is concerning, and we need to investigate further. Given the onset and nature of your symptoms, and with a normal neurological exam, my initial concern is something affecting your speech muscles or the nerves that control them. We could consider several possibilities.
PATIENT: That sounds… quite serious, Doctor. Is there anything seriously wrong with me? I apologize for not being very helpful with remembering details. It’s just… everything feels a bit fuzzy sometimes. What kind of tests are you thinking of? And what are these “possibilities” you mentioned? I trust your judgement, of course, but I would appreciate it if you could explain things in a way that I can understand.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Adyn, you’re being very helpful. And it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when something doesn't feel right. I want to assure you that I’m not saying there is anything seriously wrong, but it’s important to rule things out. The "possibilities" I mentioned are things like a mild viral infection affecting a nerve, or potentially something causing a bit of muscle weakness in your tongue or throat. It could also be related to stress or fatigue, although we want to be thorough. Rare possibilities, though less likely given your exam, include neurological conditions affecting speech. To investigate further, I'd like to order a few tests. First, I’d like to get a blood test to check for any inflammation or vitamin deficiencies. Secondly, I think a referral to a speech-language pathologist would be beneficial. They can perform a more detailed assessment of your speech and identify any specific issues. They can also perform some swallowing studies if needed. Finally, depending on the results of the blood test and SLP assessment, we might consider an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural problems, but let's start with the blood work and SLP evaluation first. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot, Doctor. But if that’s what’s necessary to find out what’s going on, then yes, that sounds alright. Blood work and seeing a speech person… I can manage that. What exactly does a speech person do? And how long will it take to get the results of the blood work? I have a pretty demanding job, and I don't want to be away for too long. Also, my husband usually drives me to appointments, so I need to know how much notice I need to give him. I apologize for all the questions. I just… want to understand everything clearly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. It’s good to ask questions. You’re right to want to understand everything clearly. A speech-language pathologist, or SLP, is a specialist who evaluates and treats speech and communication disorders. They’ll listen to your speech, assess your tongue movement and strength, and may do some exercises to help strengthen your muscles. It’s a non-invasive assessment, and they’re very good at explaining things. They’ll provide a report back to me with their findings and recommendations. As for the blood work, it typically takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. I can order it today and call you with the results as soon as I have them. I'll also make a referral for the SLP evaluation, and they will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. The SLP appointment may take longer to schedule, depending on their availability. I’ll give you a written list of the tests and the referral information, and I’ll also give you a note for your work explaining that you’re undergoing medical evaluation. I can also provide a work note if needed. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms or if your speech gets significantly worse, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very good plan, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for the notes for work. It’s a relief to know that you’re taking this seriously. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate that. I think I understand everything now. I will contact the clinic if anything changes. I'm grateful for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. It’s my job to listen to your concerns and help you get the care you need. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Here are the lab orders and the SLP referral information. I'll also print out a brief note for your employer. Have a good day, Adyn. And please take care of yourself.
