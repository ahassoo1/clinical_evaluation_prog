DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… difficult to explain. The words… they don't come so easy anymore. I find myself… searching. It’s frustrating, really. I know what I want to say, but… it just doesn’t come out right.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gyamfi. It sounds quite unsettling to experience that disconnect between your thoughts and your ability to express them. That can certainly be frustrating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: When it started… hmm. That is a good question. It wasn’t sudden, not like a switch. It was… slow. Over, maybe… six months? Perhaps longer. It’s hard to say exactly. I remember… noticing it more when I was talking to my… to friends. And… at the store. Small things, you understand? But now… it is happening more often.
DOCTOR: So, it developed gradually over the past six to twelve months, and you've noticed it becoming more frequent recently, impacting conversations with friends and even during simple interactions like shopping. To clarify, when you say the words don't come easily, can you describe how they don't come easily?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is correct. It is… like the word is on the tip of my tongue. I know what it is for… for the thing… the red fruit… you eat in the summer… Strawberry! Yes, strawberry. But sometimes… sometimes I cannot find any word. It's not just small words, either. Bigger words… important words. And sometimes… I use the wrong word. A similar word, but… not the right one. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you experience difficulty retrieving words – a feeling of them being “on the tip of your tongue,” and occasionally substituting incorrect words for the ones you intend to use. This is happening with both common and more complex vocabulary. And you’ve found it quite distressing. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if this difficulty extends to other areas?
PATIENT: Other areas…? What do you mean, Doctor? Do you mean… writing? No, I haven’t… I haven’t been writing much lately. Mostly just… letters to family. And… and bills. Reading is… okay. I can still read. But sometimes… if I read something complicated… I have to read it again. To… to understand it fully. But no… it's mostly just the speaking that is difficult. And… and finding the words. It's not my hearing, is it? I can hear you perfectly well.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gyamfi, this doesn’t sound like a hearing issue. It’s helpful to know that writing isn't affected, and that reading is generally okay, though requires more effort with complex texts. The primary difficulty is with spoken language and word retrieval. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me see. I had… high blood pressure, for a time. But it’s been… controlled. With medication. For many years now. And… and a small operation on my knee, a long time ago. Nothing serious. Oh! And… my wife… she passed away five years ago. She had… something with her heart. But… that was her. I… I haven’t been seriously ill. Not really. Do you need to know about… about her condition?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing that information. Knowing about your history of controlled high blood pressure is helpful. Regarding your wife’s condition, if you recall the general name of what she had, that would be useful, but don’t worry if you don't. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… yes. For the blood pressure. A small white pill. Once a day. And… and a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sun. That’s it, I think. Yes. Only the blood pressure pill and the vitamin. Sometimes… sometimes I take something for my… for my knees. When they are really sore. But that's only when I need it. A pain reliever. Over the counter. Do you need to know the name of that one too? It's… ibuprofen, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. So, you regularly take a medication for high blood pressure and a vitamin D supplement. Occasionally, you use ibuprofen for knee pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That is a good question. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. As a child… I think I was allergic to… to bees. But that was a very long time ago. No, I don’t think I have any allergies now. Not to food… not to medicine… not anything. I haven't had any… reactions. Nothing like that. But… my skin can be a little sensitive sometimes. To the sun. But that's not an allergy, is it? Just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. So, no known drug or food allergies, and a history of bee sting allergy in childhood, but nothing current. And some sensitivity to the sun. Now, before we proceed, could you briefly tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? What do you mean, Doctor? My… my life? Well, I… I live alone now. Since my wife passed. I have a son, he lives in… in Berlin. We talk on the telephone sometimes. I used to work… as a… a compensation specialist. For a big company. I retired a few years ago. I like to read. And… and garden. It’s a quiet life, mostly. I don't… go out much. Do you need to know more? I am not much of a… social person.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gyamfi, that’s perfectly alright. That gives me a good understanding. You live alone, have a son in Berlin, are retired, and enjoy reading and gardening. Now, I'd like to ask a few general questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision, hearing, or balance?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. My vision… not really. I wear glasses, as you can see. But I haven’t needed a stronger prescription recently. Hearing… no, my hearing is fine. You said so yourself! Balance… well, sometimes I feel a little… unsteady when I stand up quickly. But that happens to everyone, doesn't it? It’s just a little dizzy spell. Nothing serious. I haven’t fallen or anything. No… no real changes. Just a little… wobbly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. So, stable vision with glasses, good hearing, and occasional mild dizziness upon standing. Now, have you noticed any recent changes in your sleep patterns, appetite, or weight?
PATIENT: Sleep… hmm. I sleep alright, I think. Not as well as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night. But… that’s just getting old, isn’t it? Appetite… yes, my appetite is a little smaller than it used to be. I don’t eat as much. But I still enjoy my food. And… and weight? I think I have lost a little weight. Maybe a few kilos. But not much. It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t weigh myself very often.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. So, some difficulty sleeping, a slightly reduced appetite, and some unintentional weight loss. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I hope it won’t take too long. I don't… I don't like being poked and prodded, if you understand. But if it will help… then I am happy to do it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gyamfi. I’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Your throat looks clear, and your ears appear normal. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Your gait appears steady, though I did notice a slight slowness. Overall, your physical exam is largely normal. I noted a slightly elevated blood pressure and a mild slowness in your gait. Everything else appears within normal limits.
PATIENT: That is… good to hear. I am glad everything is… mostly normal. The slowness in my gait… that is probably just… getting old, isn’t it? So, what do you think is causing this… this trouble with the words, Doctor? Is it something serious? I am a little worried, if I am honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Gyamfi, and it’s good that you’re seeking medical attention. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, it doesn’t immediately suggest a serious condition. However, the difficulty with word finding, particularly as it’s gradually worsened, warrants further investigation. Several possibilities could be contributing to this. It could be related to normal age-related changes in cognitive function, or it could be something more specific. Given your age and the gradual onset, we should consider things like mild cognitive impairment, or possibly early signs of a neurodegenerative condition. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. Other factors, like stress, medication side effects, or even vitamin deficiencies, can also contribute. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to perform a brief cognitive assessment in the office – it’s a series of simple questions and tasks that can help us assess your memory and thinking skills. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help find out what is wrong… then I am happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests… and the questions… yes. Will the blood tests be painful? And will the questions be… difficult? I don't want to feel… embarrassed. But if it is necessary… then I will try my best.
DOCTOR: The blood tests are very straightforward and only involve a small needle prick. There might be a brief moment of discomfort, but it’s usually very mild. And the cognitive assessment is nothing to worry about at all. It’s a series of simple questions and tasks, like remembering a list of words or following simple instructions. It’s not a test to see if you’re “smart” or not, but simply to get a baseline understanding of your cognitive function. It's a normal part of the evaluation process. We can take breaks at any time if you feel uncomfortable, and I will explain everything clearly beforehand. I’ll order the blood tests now, and we can schedule a time for the cognitive assessment later this week. The lab results should be back in a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and develop a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Thank you. Blood tests… and the questions… I will try my best. Is there anything I should do… before the tests? Should I avoid eating anything special? Or… or anything else? I want to make sure I do everything correctly.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Mr. Gyamfi. For the blood tests, you should fast for at least eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. It's also best to avoid caffeine on the day of the test. As for the cognitive assessment, there's nothing special you need to do. Just come as you are, and try to relax and answer the questions to the best of your ability. Here are the instructions for the blood tests. It also lists the address of the lab and the times they're open. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. We’ll schedule the cognitive assessment for Thursday at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday at 2:00… yes, that sounds… fine. That gives me a few days to… prepare. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… helpful. I feel… a little less worried now. I think that is everything, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gyamfi, that is everything for today. I’m glad I could ease your worries a bit. Remember, we'll take things one step at a time. We'll get the test results, review them together, and develop a plan that works best for you. It was lovely meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before Thursday. Have a good day, Mr. Gyamfi.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day. .
