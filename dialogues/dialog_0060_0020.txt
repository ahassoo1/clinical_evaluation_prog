DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you. I am here for this… telehealth thing. The lady on the phone said I need to talk to you. It is about my… health, yes? I do not feel so good lately, but… I am not sure what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, telehealth is… convenient, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Convenient… yes. But… I prefer to talk to people, face to face. It is… better for understanding. I sometimes… I do not hear so well, and it is hard to know what is said on the phone. Is this okay? You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand perfectly. It’s… alright that we’re doing this in person. It’s just… a lot of paperwork involved these days. Let's try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Efficient… yes. Good. I try to be efficient also. What do you want to know? I have Medicare, if that is important. And… I am a mechanic. Cars, you know? I fix them. For many years. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. And… cars. Right. Well, let's focus on you for now, Ms. Benites. You said you haven't been feeling well lately. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It is… hard to explain. It is not one thing. I am… tired. All the time. Even after sleeping. And… my hands. They ache. Especially in the morning. It is difficult to hold the tools. I work with small things, you know? Nuts and bolts. It is… important to have strong hands. And sometimes… my stomach hurts. Not always, but… often enough to be annoying. Is that… a good start?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, hand pain, stomach discomfort. Alright. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… maybe six months ago? It started slowly. I just felt… less energy. I thought it was the winter. But it did not get better in the spring. It is… constant now. Every day. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now… I need to rest in the afternoon. Is that… helpful? Six months, maybe. It is hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of fatigue. And these hand aches… where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: It is… in the joints, mostly. The knuckles… and the wrists. Sometimes in the fingers, too. It hurts to… twist them. To grip things. Like when I use the wrench. Or… even to open a jar. It is… not always bad. Some days are worse than others. But it is always there, a little bit. And it is… stiff in the morning. Very stiff. I need to… work it out. Move my hands around to get them going. Is that… clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, joints and stiffness. Alright. And this stomach discomfort… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It is… not a sharp pain. More like… a dull ache. And… sometimes I feel… bloated. Like there is too much air in my stomach. And… I do not eat so well anymore. I used to have a big appetite. Now… I am not hungry. Sometimes I feel… sick to my stomach. But I do not… throw up. It is just… uncomfortable. And it happens… after I eat, mostly. But not always. It is… difficult to explain. It is not… one thing. Like the tiredness. And the hands. Everything is… little bits of trouble. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, hand pain and stiffness, and abdominal discomfort. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not very often, but… enough to notice. And… I have been losing weight. Not much, but… my clothes are a little looser. I do not… try to lose weight. I eat what I can. And… oh! I have been… going to the bathroom more often. To pee. Especially at night. I have to get up… one or two times. It is… annoying. Is that… important? I do not want to bother you with too many things. But… I try to remember everything. It is important to tell you the truth.
DOCTOR: Dizziness, weight loss, increased urination… Yes, that’s… a lot of things, Ms. Benites. Let’s go back a bit. Have you noticed any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever… no. I do not think so. I do not feel hot. And… no chills. I live in a warm house. I do not get cold easily. And… I do not sweat much. Even when I work on the cars. Sometimes, a little, but… not a lot. I always check the temperature in the shop, you know. It is important for the machines. But… I have not checked my own temperature. I do not… feel sick like with a cold or the flu. It is… different. Like everything is just… slowing down. Is that… clear? I am sorry if I am not explaining it well. I am not good with… medical words.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or sweating. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was young, I had… the measles. And chickenpox. But… that was a long time ago. And… I had my appendix out. When I was maybe twenty years old. But… that was also a long time ago. Other than that… no. I have not been to the doctor much. I am usually healthy. I work hard, I eat good food… I do not smoke, I do not drink… I try to take care of myself. But… lately… I do not know what is happening. I feel… old. Is that… okay? It is… strange. I have never felt like this before. And I do not want to bother you with too many stories. But… I want to be honest. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Measles, chickenpox, appendectomy. Any surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No. Just the appendix. When I was young. It was… a long time ago. I do not… like surgeries. I prefer to fix things myself. Cars, you know? It is… better to be in control. I do not want anyone cutting me open. I do not… trust doctors so much. But… I came here today because… I do not know what is happening. I need help. I hope you can help me. Is that… okay? I am sorry if I am rambling. I am nervous. It is… strange to talk about these things. Especially to someone I do not know. But… I try to be honest. That is important, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think so. I have not taken many medications. When I was young, I took… penicillin, maybe? For a sore throat. But… I do not remember having a reaction. And… I took some pain relievers when I had my appendix out. But… I do not remember anything bad happening. I do not like taking pills. I prefer to… tough it out. I do not want to put things in my body that I do not need. I do not… trust them. Is that… okay? I know it is strange. But… I try to stay away from medications. Unless I really need them. And… I have not taken anything recently. Not for a long time. Is that… clear? I am sorry if I am rambling again. I am just… trying to remember everything. It is… hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medication allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I do not take anything. Not even vitamins. I try to get everything I need from my food. I eat… mostly vegetables and meat. And… bread. I make my own bread sometimes. It is… good for me. I do not like taking pills. I do not… trust them. I do not… want to put things in my body that I do not need. I do not… want to get sick from the pills. I do not… want to get addicted to the pills. I do not… want to spend money on the pills. I do not… want to bother the doctor with the pills. I do not… want to worry about the pills. I do not… want the pills. Is that… clear? I know it is strange. But… I do not take any pills. Not even aspirin. I do not… want them. I do not… need them. I just… want to be healthy. Is that… okay? I am sorry if I am rambling again. I am just… trying to be honest. It is… hard. I think I said this before. But… I do not take any pills. At all. Not even… maybe just something for a headache once, a long time ago, but nothing now.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My… mother, she had… high blood pressure. And… she had arthritis, maybe? In her hands. She had trouble… gripping things. Like me. And… my father, he had… heart problems. He died when he was… maybe seventy years old. A heart attack, I think. And… my brother, he has… diabetes. He has to take… pills. I do not like that. And… my sister, she is… healthy. As far as I know. But… we do not see each other much. And… my grandparents… I do not know so much about them. They died when I was young. Is that… helpful? I do not know much about family history. We do not… talk about these things. It is… strange. But… my mother and my father had problems. And my brother has problems. Is that… enough? I do not want to bother you with too many stories. But… I try to be honest. It is… important. But… I do not know much about family history. I do not… remember. I just… know that my mother and my father had problems. And my brother. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, heart disease. And finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. Never have. It is… bad for your health. My mother smoked. She died of lung cancer. I do not drink alcohol, either. It is… bad for your liver. And… I do not use any recreational drugs. Never have. It is… illegal. And… bad for your brain. I work hard. I eat good food. I try to take care of myself. I do not need… these things. I do not… want them. I do not… trust them. I do not… like them. I do not… want to get sick. I do not… want to die. I just… want to be healthy. Is that… clear? I do not smoke, I do not drink, I do not use drugs. Never have. Not even a little bit. I just… want to be healthy. Is that… okay? I do not… know why I am explaining this. It seems… obvious. But… I want you to know. I just… want to be healthy. Is that… enough? .
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that's a lot of information. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. And then I'll listen to your lungs and abdomen.
