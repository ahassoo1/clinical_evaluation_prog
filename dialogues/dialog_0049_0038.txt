DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand I requested some paperwork regarding… future care, perhaps? I apologize for the vagueness. My memory isn't what it once was, and the details are…slippery. I believe it has to do with making decisions if I…am unable to do so myself. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Future care…ah, yes. Advance directives, likely. It is prudent to consider these things. Though frankly, at your age, it's a bit unusual to be focusing on this already. But, alright. So, you’re concerned about being able to make healthcare decisions if you were to become incapacitated. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Incapacitated… yes, that sounds right. It’s not… a pressing concern, not exactly. More of a… preventative measure. My…ex-husband, he was quite insistent. He said it was… foolish not to have something in place. Honestly, I don’t recall the specifics of why he felt so strongly, only that he did. It feels important, but I’m afraid I haven’t a clear picture of what these directives are. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I apologize for my… confusion. It’s rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Well, your ex-husband isn't entirely incorrect. It’s good to be prepared. These directives are essentially legal documents that outline your wishes for medical treatment if you’re unable to communicate them yourself. There are a couple of key components. A Living Will specifies what types of treatments you do or do not want—things like life support, feeding tubes, resuscitation. And then there's a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which names someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you can’t. Does that clarify things somewhat?
PATIENT: A Living Will… and a Power of Attorney. That sounds…complicated. Life support… resuscitation… I suppose I have opinions on those things, but I haven't really articulated them. And naming someone… that feels… weighty. I’m divorced, you see. My family is… distant. I'm not certain I have anyone I would completely trust with such a responsibility. Perhaps this wasn’t such a good idea after all. Is it…necessary? If I don't have these documents, what happens then?
DOCTOR: Well, necessary is a strong word. It’s more about having peace of mind. If you don’t have these documents, and you become incapacitated, the hospital will try to locate family members to make decisions for you. It can become… complicated, and often drawn-out. And, frankly, those family members may not know your wishes, or may disagree amongst themselves. It's rarely a smooth process. But if you're not comfortable naming someone, we don't have to do it today. We can start with just discussing your preferences for treatment—what you would or wouldn’t want in various scenarios. Would that be more manageable?
PATIENT: That…sounds better, yes. Discussing it. Simply talking about it. The thought of assigning such power…it feels premature. And, to be honest, a little frightening. I suppose… life support is…unappealing. I’ve seen it in films, of course. It doesn’t seem… dignified. And feeding tubes… I couldn’t bear the thought of being unable to… eat normally. Though, if it’s the only way… I don’t know. It’s all so difficult. Perhaps you could give me some examples? Specific scenarios, like you mentioned? That might… help me clarify my thoughts.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s consider this: You are in the hospital, suffering from a severe stroke. There is no realistic chance of recovery, and you are unable to breathe on your own. Would you want to be placed on a ventilator, or would you prefer comfort care only?
PATIENT: A stroke… That's… a rather stark scenario. No chance of recovery… I hadn't considered something so definitive. A ventilator… prolonging things… No. No, I don't think so. I believe… I would not want to be kept alive artificially. If there is no hope… then I would prefer comfort care. To be… allowed to pass peacefully. But… what is comfort care? Does that mean… no food, no water either? It feels… harsh. Is there any way to… lessen the discomfort, even then? I apologize for all the questions. It’s just… it’s a lot to process.
DOCTOR: Comfort care focuses on managing pain and symptoms to ensure you are as comfortable as possible. It can involve withholding artificial nutrition and hydration, yes, if that would cause more distress. But it's not automatic. The goal is to alleviate suffering, not to hasten death. We would consult with palliative care specialists to develop a plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any specific concerns about pain management?
PATIENT: Pain management… yes. That is a significant concern. I’ve always had a… low tolerance for pain. Even a simple toothache is… unbearable. And the thought of… prolonged suffering… it terrifies me. Would… would there be medication? Strong medication? And… who would decide when enough is enough? Would I be… conscious? Aware of… everything? It’s a terrible thought. Perhaps I should reconsider this entire exercise. It’s far too upsetting.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Buoniconti, these are difficult questions, naturally. And it's perfectly acceptable to feel overwhelmed. We can certainly slow down, or even postpone this discussion altogether. However, if you do want to proceed, you need to understand that pain management is a priority. We would use whatever medications are necessary to keep you comfortable. As for who makes the decisions, you do, as long as you are capable. If you are not, then we would follow the guidance of your healthcare proxy, if you’ve designated one. And yes, depending on the medication and the situation, you may or may not be fully conscious. It’s… variable. Are you familiar with the concept of a DNR – Do Not Resuscitate order?
PATIENT: A DNR… Do Not Resuscitate. I think… I've heard of it. It means… if my heart stops, don’t try to… revive me? Is that correct? The thought of… not being revived… it’s… unsettling. But then, the thought of being brought back to… a life I wouldn’t recognize… is equally terrifying. Is there… a middle ground? Could I… specify certain conditions? Perhaps I would want resuscitation if… there was a reasonable chance of recovery, but not… if it was clear… I don’t know. This is all so confusing. Perhaps you could explain the difference between resuscitation and… life support? I'm clearly not grasping the nuances.
DOCTOR: Very well. Resuscitation—CPR, defibrillation—is what we do when your heart or breathing stops. It's an attempt to restore function. Life support—ventilators, feeding tubes—is what we use to maintain function when you're unable to do it yourself. They are separate things, although often used together. A DNR order means we will not attempt resuscitation. You can specify conditions, yes. For example, you could say you want resuscitation only if there is a reasonable expectation of regaining cognitive function. However, determining “reasonable expectation” is… subjective. It's often a difficult conversation for families. Frankly, Ms. Buoniconti, this is a lot to unpack in one session. Perhaps we should schedule another appointment, and you can think about your preferences in the meantime?
PATIENT: Yes. Another appointment. That sounds… wiser. I need time to… process everything. And perhaps… do some research. Although I doubt I’ll understand much of it. Thank you, Doctor. For your patience. And for… explaining things. Even if I haven't fully grasped them. I… I’ll schedule something for next month, perhaps? If you have availability.
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will schedule something for you. Next month works. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any immediate concerns. We'll revisit this at your convenience. Good day, Ms. Buoniconti. .
