DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… lovely to meet you as well. Hmm, what brings me in… Well, it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s my daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. There’s been a bit of that in the family, I think. My brother, he used to get terrible headaches. It’s all a bit fuzzy, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very common for things to be a little fuzzy, and your daughter was smart to bring you in to get things checked out. We'll take our time. So, you mentioned weakness and headaches. Can you tell me a little more about the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my daughter says I've been having them more often. They’re… not constant, you understand? They come and go. And they’re not always the same headache, if that makes sense. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, like a band around my head. Other times… well, other times they’re sharper. I don’t know… I don’t usually pay much attention to the details, I just take a little lie-down and hope they pass. I’ve always been one to just “push through” things, you know? Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: It is very helpful, thank you. And it’s good you've been able to rest when you need to. The fact that they vary is good information. When did you first notice these headaches becoming more frequent, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… roughly… Let me think. My daughter… she’s always good with dates. It feels like… maybe since the spring? Yes, definitely after the weather warmed up. But it’s hard to say for sure. Time just… slips away, you know? It feels like everything is blending together lately. Was there something important that happened in the spring? I can't quite recall…
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal for things to be a little less clear as time goes on. Don't worry about pinpointing a specific date. Just the spring is helpful enough. And no, I don't see anything noted in your chart about a specific event. Now, you also mentioned weakness. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Weakness… Oh, goodness. It's not like I can’t do things, you understand? I still manage to do my little cross-stitch, and I get around the house… But sometimes, my hand feels… heavy. Like I’m trying to lift something really, really big. And sometimes my leg… just feels clumsy. Like I might stumble. It doesn’t happen all the time, just… sometimes. It’s mostly on one side, I think. The left side, maybe? Oh, now I’m not so sure… I really wish I could be more precise. It's all so frustrating!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you're doing great. It's good you're aware of it being more on one side, even if you're not certain which. And it’s helpful you can still do things, but notice the effort. Does anything seem to trigger this weakness, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger… Hmm. Well, sometimes after I’ve been standing for a long time, it feels a bit more noticeable. Like when I'm doing the dishes, or if I've been at the grocery store. And maybe… if I get a bit flustered? My daughter says I get a little worked up easily these days. But it’s hard to say if that's connected. It just feels like everything is more… difficult, you know? I don’t think anything specifically sets it off, but those things seem to make it… more present. Is that what you mean by trigger? I’m not very good with these medical terms.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly, and that is exactly what I mean by trigger. It sounds like standing for a long time and being a bit stressed can bring it on. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, vision… Now that’s a good question. Well, I have gotten new glasses recently. The old ones were getting a bit scratched, you see. But other than that… Hmm. Sometimes things seem a bit blurry, but I just figured that was my age. Or maybe just needing to clean my glasses. I don't think I've noticed anything drastic. No double vision, or spots, or anything like that. Just… a little fuzziness around the edges, maybe? Like looking through a slightly dirty window. Is that normal for someone my age? I wouldn’t want to worry you unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. And it is very common to have some changes in vision as we get older. The fuzziness you describe is something we can certainly check. Have you noticed any difficulty speaking, or understanding what people say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a scary question! No, no, I don’t think so. My daughter always tells me I talk too much, if anything! She says I repeat myself sometimes, but that’s just because I’m an old gossip, she says. No, I haven't had trouble understanding people. And I can still order my cappuccino just fine! I wouldn’t know what to do if I couldn’t do that. It’s just… sometimes I lose my train of thought, you know? Like I start to say something, and then… it just vanishes. But I wouldn’t say that’s a speaking problem, necessarily. Just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're right, losing your train of thought is very common, and doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or balance issues?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Hmm. I don’t think so. Not really. Sometimes, when I stand up quickly, I feel a little… whoozy. But I always figured that was just low blood sugar. I try to have a little something to eat regularly. But I haven’t actually fallen, or anything like that. And I don’t feel like the room is spinning, or anything. Just… a little unsteady sometimes. And I do try to be careful, you know? I don’t want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. Now there’s a long list, I suspect. Let me think. I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, that’s why I do the cross-stitch, keeps them moving. And my blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes, but I take a little pill for that. And… oh, yes, I had my gallbladder out years ago. But other than that… I can’t really recall anything major. My daughter keeps all my records, you see. She’s very organized. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I don’t want to leave anything out. It’s just… my memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can look at your records, don't worry. Arthritis, high blood pressure, and gallbladder removal – that’s good to know. And it’s perfectly fine that your daughter helps keep track of things. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I take a little something for the arthritis, it’s just over the counter, I think. Ibuprofen, maybe? Or naproxen? Something like that. And sometimes, when my blood pressure is really high, my doctor gives me a stronger pill to take. But I don’t take that very often. And… oh, yes, I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter says I don’t get enough sunlight. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I just take what they tell me to take! Is that bad? I wouldn’t want to mix anything up.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all, it’s good you’re taking things as prescribed. We’ll get a full list from your records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in years. And I don’t have any food allergies, as far as I know. I eat everything! Except maybe liver, I never liked liver. But other than that, no allergies to speak of. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s always a bit hard to remember these things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, except for bee stings in the past. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother, she had a bit of heart trouble when she got older. And my brother, he used to get terrible migraines. Really bad ones. He'd have to lie down in a dark room for hours. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But other than that… I can't really recall anything major. It's been so long, you know? And there were so many of us! It's hard to keep track of everything. My daughter says she has all the details written down somewhere, she's very organized. But I'm afraid I just don't have a very good memory for these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble, migraines, and diabetes in the family. That's helpful. Now, finally, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh, goodness. Well, I’ve been married for… oh, goodness, it must be over sixty years now! To a wonderful man, bless his heart. He's not feeling very well these days, that's why I don't get out as much. I used to love to go to the bingo hall with my friends, but I haven't been in months. And I used to volunteer at the church, but I had to stop when my husband got sick. I mostly stay home now, and do my cross-stitch, and watch my little stories on TV. It’s a quiet life, but it’s a good life. We don't smoke, and we don't drink very much. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Is that what you mean by social history? I'm not very good with these terms, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Thank you for sharing. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I just hope I don't have anything too serious! I'm a bit of a worrier, you see. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready. I'll just sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90, but not alarmingly so. I hear a regular rhythm, but there’s a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal at your age, but we’ll note it. Finally, I'm going to have you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. Your coordination seems good. Overall, your exam is mostly normal, but the elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a CT scan… That sounds a bit scary, doesn't it? Blood work, that’s alright, I’ve had plenty of those. But a scan… Is it really necessary, Doctor? I'm not sure I like the sound of that. What are you looking for, exactly? I always worry about what they're going to find. Will it be painful? And how long will it take? I just hope it’s not anything too serious. I'm already so worried about my husband…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Alayne. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about a CT scan. It's not usually painful at all. You’ll lie on a table, and the machine will take images of your brain. It’s like a very sophisticated X-ray. It doesn’t involve any needles or injections, unless we need to use contrast dye, which we can discuss. We're looking for any abnormalities that could be causing your headaches and weakness, such as a stroke, a tumor, or signs of bleeding. These are unlikely, but it's important to rule them out, especially given your symptoms. The scan will take about 15-20 minutes. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail. And I assure you, we’ll take every precaution to ensure your safety and comfort. If you’re not comfortable with the scan, we can explore other options, but it will make it more challenging to find the cause of your symptoms. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh… well, if it's just like an X-ray, that doesn't sound too bad. But the thought of finding something… My daughter always says I worry too much. She’d probably insist I go through with it, anyway. She’s very practical. And I suppose if it helps find out what's wrong… maybe it's worth it. But what about the contrast dye? Is that necessary? I've heard it can cause problems. And how long will I have to wait for the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks, worrying even more. Is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Should I tell my daughter? She’s the one who brought me in, after all.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s wise to be cautious. We don’t necessarily need the contrast dye, but it can sometimes help us see things more clearly. The risks are generally low, but it can cause a temporary allergic reaction in some people. We'll discuss those risks in detail if we decide to use it. We can schedule the scan for as early as tomorrow morning. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. And yes, absolutely, please tell your daughter. She’s right to be involved, and it’s always good to have someone with you. She can help you with any questions you have, and provide support. Before the scan, just let the technician know if you have any allergies or medical conditions. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. For now, let's focus on getting the scan scheduled. If it comes back clear, that will be very reassuring. If it shows something, we’ll discuss the options together. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, let’s schedule it. Tomorrow morning sounds… as good as anything, I suppose. It’s just… a lot to take in. My daughter will be glad to hear it, she's always so on top of things. And I'll be sure to tell the technician about everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and you’ve been so patient with my worries. I appreciate that very much. Is there anything else I need to do before tomorrow? Any specific questions I should ask the technician? I don’t want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alayne. It's my job to make you feel comfortable and informed. There's not much else you need to do for now. Just try to relax and get a good night’s sleep. When you see the technician, you can ask them about the radiation exposure – it’s a very low dose, but it's good to be informed. You can also ask them about any potential side effects. But honestly, the scan is very safe and well-tolerated. And most importantly, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns between now and tomorrow. We're here to help. For now, I'm going to write up the order for the scan and get it sent to the radiology department. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I feel a bit better now, knowing what to expect. And I’ll definitely call if I think of anything. A follow-up appointment is a good idea. It’s good to have a plan. You've been very kind and patient with an old woman like me. I really appreciate it. I think that’s all I need for now. I'll let my daughter handle the rest. She's very good at these things.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Alayne. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We’ll see you soon. And please give my best to your daughter. Have a good day.
