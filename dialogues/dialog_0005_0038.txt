DOCTOR: Alright, Evann, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… rather difficult to explain precisely. I believe I need to make some arrangements, just in case. Something about… what one does when one is unable to speak for oneself. A friend mentioned a form, an “Advance Directive” or perhaps a “POLST” form? I confess, the details are… hazy. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Right. "Just in case." Look, people come in here with all sorts of anxieties. It sounds like you're thinking about end-of-life planning. A bit young for that, frankly, but… alright. Let's try to be specific. Are you experiencing any new health issues that prompted this concern?
PATIENT: New health issues… no, not precisely. It isn’t a sudden worry, Doctor. More of… a persistent one. My memory, you see. It’s… unreliable. I’ve always been rather… scattered, but it’s become more pronounced recently. And I’ve been thinking… if something were to happen, and I couldn’t communicate my wishes… well, it feels irresponsible not to have something in place. I’m divorced, and while I have acquaintances, there’s no one I would necessarily rely upon to make those sorts of decisions for me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s memory concerns driving this. "Scattered" isn't a diagnosis, Evann. Everyone forgets things. But alright, let’s document this. How long have you noticed this increasing forgetfulness?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. It’s not a sudden shift, Doctor. More of a… gradual fading. Perhaps… the last few years? It’s hard to pinpoint. It's not like I can recall a specific date when it started. It's more the increasing frequency of… gaps. I sometimes struggle to remember recent conversations, or the names of people I’ve just met. Small things, mostly, but… unsettling. I do apologize for not being more precise. It feels rather foolish to not have a clearer account.
DOCTOR: "Unsettling" doesn’t help me, Evann. We need specifics to rule things out. Are these memory lapses impacting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. It's… subtle, mostly. I sometimes misplace things – keys, my etching tools – and have difficulty retracing my steps. And… I occasionally find myself unsure of appointments I've scheduled. It hasn’t progressed to the point of being debilitating, but it is causing a level of… anxiety, as I mentioned. I’m a meticulous person, Doctor, and this… lack of control… is rather distressing. It interferes with my work, primarily. A precise engraving requires a focused mind, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're noticing misplacing things, trouble remembering appointments, and it's affecting your work. Have you experienced any changes in your mood, sleep, or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes in mood… not significantly, I don’t believe. Perhaps a little more… preoccupied, given my concerns, but I wouldn’t characterize it as a mood change. Sleep has been… adequate. I tend to work late, so my schedule is somewhat irregular. Appetite is normal. I maintain a… simple diet. Mostly fish and vegetables, when I’m not too engrossed in my work to remember to eat. I do apologize again for the lack of clarity. I feel as though I’m being remarkably unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m not asking for a novel, Evann. Just trying to get a baseline. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no, none regularly. Occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever for a strained hand, but nothing prescribed. Vitamins… I try to take a multivitamin, but truthfully, I often forget. As for supplements… no. I prefer to rely on a healthy diet, when I remember to eat one. Is this… relevant to the memory issues, Doctor? Perhaps I should mention I’ve always been rather prone to distraction. It’s a character flaw, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, occasional pain reliever, inconsistent multivitamin. Given your age and the described symptoms, and the fact you’re experiencing anxiety around these memory lapses… we need to rule out some things. I'm going to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It's not a full neurological workup, just a few simple tests to get a better understanding of your current mental state. Then, I’ll likely order some blood work to check for deficiencies and other underlying causes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A cognitive assessment and blood work seem… prudent. I apologize for being so… vague. I assure you, I am typically a more organized individual. This… forgetfulness is rather distressing. I simply wish to be certain, you see. To be prepared. I trust your judgment implicitly. When would you like to proceed with the assessment?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let’s get started then. It will only take about fifteen to twenty minutes. I’m going to ask you a series of questions and have you perform a few simple tasks. Please just do your best. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… August… the second? Yes, I believe it is August 2nd. The year… is it 2025, Doctor? I apologize, that feels… remarkably distant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: The city… That’s… a surprisingly difficult question. I believe… it's an urban center? I moved here relatively recently, you see. My acquaintance mentioned something about… it being a major port city. I’m afraid my sense of direction – and geography – has always been… lacking. Is this… detrimental to the assessment, Doctor? I apologize for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: It's... unhelpful, Evann. You moved here relatively recently and don’t know what city you're in?
PATIENT: I know I’m in a city, Doctor. It’s… simply that my relocation was rather sudden. I was preoccupied with establishing my workshop. I’ve focused on my engraving, and… neglected to familiarize myself with my surroundings. I apologize profusely. It’s… foolish, I admit. It’s not that I don’t know, precisely, but rather that I haven't… made the effort to learn the name. Perhaps my acquaintance can remind me? I'm profoundly embarrassed. I assure you, I am usually a more… grounded individual.
DOCTOR: Evann, this is becoming… concerning. We’re not discussing your hobbies; we’re assessing your cognitive function. Do you recall anything about your journey here?
PATIENT: A journey… There was a train, I believe. A long journey. And… a relocation sale, to dispose of my previous studio. I remember… the difficulty of transporting my tools. And a… rather unpleasant inn, with… persistent draughts. Details are… fragmented, Doctor. Like… pieces of a broken mosaic. I recall the feeling of upheaval, of leaving… but not the specifics of the location. It's as though… the memories are coated in a layer of… mist. It’s profoundly unsettling, I assure you. I should remember, shouldn’t I? I want to remember. Perhaps… if I could see something familiar… a photograph, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s stop there for now. This is… not good. I'm ordering a comprehensive blood panel and a referral to a neurologist. You need a full cognitive evaluation. And frankly, I'm concerned enough that I'm going to recommend someone be with you until we have results. Do you have any family or close friends who can assist you?
PATIENT: A neurologist… comprehensive blood work… and someone… with me? It’s… more serious than I anticipated. As for family… I am estranged from my siblings. And… friends… acquaintances, perhaps, but no one I would rely upon. I live… quite independently. I believe I can manage… but perhaps… a companion would be… prudent, given the circumstances. I confess, the thought is… unsettling. I haven’t relied on assistance in… a very long time. But… if you believe it is necessary… I will consider it. Could you perhaps recommend an agency? Or… a suitable companion? I truly apologize for… all of this. It’s… quite overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Here's a list of neurologists in the area, and a few agencies specializing in companion care. We're also going to rule out vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and early-onset dementia. Don't panic, Evann, but you need to take this seriously. I’ll have the lab results sent to the neurologist. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And please, try to arrange for someone to be with you. I'm concerned about your ability to function independently given these symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Neurologist… companion care… comprehensive assessment. I… will schedule an appointment immediately. And I will… attempt to arrange for assistance. It’s… rather frightening, to admit one’s limitations. But… I trust your judgment implicitly. You believe it is necessary, and… I will comply. Thank you, Doctor. For your… candor. And for… not dismissing my concerns. Although… the thought of relinquishing my independence… is profoundly unsettling. Is there… anything else I should know? Or… any resources you would recommend? Perhaps… a support group? For individuals experiencing… cognitive decline? It feels… remarkably isolating.
DOCTOR: There’s a local Alzheimer’s Association chapter – here’s their contact information. They offer support groups and resources for both patients and caregivers. I'll also have the nurse give you a list of things to avoid – driving, operating machinery, managing finances – until we have a diagnosis. And Evann… please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any sudden changes or feel overwhelmed. We’ll get through this, but you need to take this seriously and accept help when you need it. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Alzheimer’s Association… I will contact them immediately. And… I appreciate the caution regarding driving and finances. Prudence is… paramount, given the circumstances. No, Doctor, I believe that is all for now. You have… addressed all of my concerns, and… provided invaluable guidance. Thank you. Truly. Although… the prospect of facing this… uncertainty… is daunting. I will schedule the appointments as soon as possible. And… I will attempt to embrace assistance. It’s… a challenge, but… I will endeavor to do so. Thank you again, Doctor. For your… kindness. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care of yourself, Evann. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes.
