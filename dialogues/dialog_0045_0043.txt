DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GIBBEL. Have a seat. Eighty-four, huh?
PATIENT: Yep, eighty-four come October the 18th. Though sometimes I feel like I'm still forty! But lately... this headache's got me feelin' every single one of those years.
DOCTOR: Headache, alright. And how long has this headache been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it started properly about… three weeks ago, I reckon. But it wasn't bad bad then. Just a little throbbin' now and then. The last week though… it’s been pretty constant. Right at the back of my head, feels like a tight band.
DOCTOR: Constant, you say. And is it the same kind of pain all the time, or does it change?
PATIENT: It’s mostly just… a dull ache, you know? Like someone’s tightened a rope around my head. But sometimes, if I move my neck just so, or if I try to really think hard… it'll shoot a sharp pain right up the back there. Not for long, just a quick little zap. And it sometimes makes me feel a little… dizzy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Dizzy, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, not fall-down dizzy, thankfully. Just… kinda lightheaded. Like I’m floatin’ a bit. It doesn’t happen every time I get the headache, but maybe… half the time? It’s hard to say exactly. And it seems worse when I’m tired, or if I haven’t eaten. I’m usually pretty good at lookin’ after myself, but this just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. GIBBEL, at your age, and with dizziness involved, we need to rule a few things out. Have you had any trouble with your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Now that you mention it… things haven't been quite as sharp as they used to be, I suppose. But I figured that was just gettin’ old! I don’t see any spots or anything, and I can still read my newspaper fine… with my glasses, of course. But maybe… things are a little blurry sometimes, especially when I look at things far away? I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. I've always just adjusted. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be, Mr. GIBBEL. We'll get to that. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not really. I still walk just fine, and I can manage my gardenin’ okay. My hands get a little stiff sometimes, especially in the mornin’, but that’s just arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. I take some stuff for that. No trouble holdin’ things, nothin’ like that. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, you know? I'm not one for complainin’, so I wouldn't notice somethin’ small, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your memory or confusion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, now… I forget where I put my keys sometimes, same as anyone, I reckon. And I might take a little longer to remember a name now and then. But I haven’t been gettin’ lost, or confused about where I am. My daughter checks on me regularly, and she says I’m doin’ okay. I remember all my grandkids’ birthdays, and I can still tell you stories from when I was a boy. I may be old, but I ain't losin' my marbles yet. Though sometimes I do repeat myself... is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GIBBEL. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. A little stiff, but I can manage. Just give me a moment. What are we lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Alright, look straight ahead. Now follow my finger... Keep your eyes on it. Good. Now close your eyes. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yep, I can feel that. A little cool, but nothin’ strange. Is somethin’ wrong? You seem… worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems normal so far. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that's to be expected at your age. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but again, not terribly concerning. But, given your headache and the dizziness, I think we should get a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything serious. It's a precaution, really.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Now, hold on a minute. Is it somethin’ bad? I haven’t had one of those before. Is it… dangerous? I don’t like hospitals much, and I'd rather not be poked and prodded if I can avoid it. Could it be somethin’ else? Maybe just… stress? I've been worryin' about my grandson lately… he's havin' some trouble with… well, never mind. But is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. GIBBEL, I understand your concerns. But at your age, a headache with dizziness requires investigation. It's highly unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out a bleed or a tumor. It’s a quick scan, and it will give us peace of mind. It's not dangerous, just a little radiation exposure, which is minimal. Frankly, I'd be negligent not to order one. I’ll write you a referral to the hospital, and they’ll schedule it for you. I want this done within the next 24-48 hours, alright?
PATIENT: … 24-48 hours… Alright. If you think it's best. But I don't like hospitals, you know? And I haven't got anyone to take me… my daughter works all day. Will they explain everything to me if they find somethin'? I don't want to be left in the dark. And… what if it is somethin’ bad? What then?
DOCTOR: Look, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The hospital will explain everything if they find anything. And you can always call my office if you have questions. Frankly, you're worrying about nothing, but we have to rule things out. I'll have the referral ready for you before you leave. Here's a list of the hospital's phone number and address. Get it done, Mr. GIBBEL. It's for your own good. Now, do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: … No. I guess not. Just… a lot to take in. I just wish it wasn't necessary. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… lookin’ after me. Even if I don't like what you're suggestin’. I suppose I better go home and… think about it. And call my daughter. I hope everything's alright. .
