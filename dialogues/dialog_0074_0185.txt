DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the receptionist. It’s my breath. It smells. Bad. It’s embarrassing, okay? I don't have time for a whole life story about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing, and I appreciate you sharing that with me, even if it feels uncomfortable. It's good you're addressing it. While a “life story” isn’t necessary, a little more information helps me understand why it’s concerning you now, and if anything else might be going on. Could you tell me when you first noticed this change in your breath?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. A few weeks ago, maybe? It just…started. I noticed people were subtly backing away when I talked to them. It's pretty obvious. I don't need a degree to figure that out. It's not like it's a sudden thing, but it's gotten worse recently. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. So, it's been gradually worsening over a few weeks. And you’ve noticed a social impact – people reacting to it. I want to assure you that we'll try to figure this out. To help me narrow things down, could you describe the smell?
PATIENT: Like…bad breath. What do you want me to say? It smells awful! Rotten, I guess. Like something died. I don't sit around analyzing my own breath, Doctor. It's unpleasant, that's all you need to know. I brush, okay? I really do.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s unpleasant to think about, and you're understandably frustrated. I apologize for asking you to describe it; I'm just trying to get a clearer picture. You mentioned you brush regularly. Could you tell me about your oral hygiene routine?
PATIENT: Look, I brush my teeth twice a day. Sometimes. Okay, most of the time. I use toothpaste. What more do you need to know? It’s not like I’m some cavewoman who doesn't know how to use a toothbrush. And I floss…when I remember. Honestly, it’s a hassle.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Zelina. It sounds like your routine is fairly standard, although consistency can be important. Now, outside of your teeth, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No. I mean, I'm tired, but everyone's tired, right? I had a divorce a while back, so…yeah. That's stressful. But that's not got anything to do with my breath. I don’t have a sore throat or anything, if that’s what you're asking. Just…tired. And annoyed. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Zelina. A recent divorce is certainly a major life stressor, and it’s good you’re acknowledging that. It can absolutely affect overall health. Okay, so no sore throat, no other immediate oral symptoms. Let's move onto your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. I'm perfectly healthy, aside from the obvious. Look, I work highway maintenance. It's physical. I'm outside all day. I'm not sitting in an office getting sick all the time. I don't need a doctor, honestly. I just need this breath thing fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting a quick resolution. Being physically active and working outdoors is excellent for your health, so that's good to hear. Okay, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No! Look, I had my wisdom teeth out when I was younger, does that count? But that was ages ago. Otherwise, no. I've never been seriously sick. I don't have time for hospitals. I have a job to do. This is ridiculous. Are you going to give me something for it or what?
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal, noted, thank you. It's helpful to know. Okay. And regarding family history - do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had similar issues with bad breath, or any chronic medical conditions like diabetes or dry mouth?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? I have no idea. My family is…complicated. I barely talk to them. My mother always smelled like cigarettes and perfume, so I wouldn’t know if she had bad breath anyway. My father…never mind. It doesn't matter. Look, I don't have a family doctor, okay? I don't know their medical history. Can we just skip this part? I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s a sensitive topic, and it’s perfectly alright if you don't have that information. We can certainly move on. To get a better idea of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick examination. I’ll check your mouth and throat, listen to your lungs, and check your vital signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And be quick, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina. Just open wide for me. I'm just taking a look. Your gums appear slightly inflamed, and I notice some plaque buildup. Your tongue also looks a little coated. No obvious lesions or significant abnormalities. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6°F. Based on what you've told me and the initial examination, it appears your bad breath might be related to poor oral hygiene and some mild inflammation in your gums. The coated tongue can also contribute. It is important to rule out other causes though. Would you be willing to undergo some tests to determine the source of your breath?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? Look, I don't want anything complicated. And I don't have insurance, so…I don't know if I can afford anything expensive. I just want something to fix it, not a whole battery of tests. Is there a simple mouthwash or something? A pill? Anything easy? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and time, Zelina. There are some simpler options we can explore before resorting to extensive testing. A simple mouthwash isn't likely to solve the underlying issue, but can provide temporary relief. However, to determine the cause, a few things would be helpful. We could do a quick saliva test to check for dry mouth, which can contribute to bad breath. We could also check for Helicobacter pylori infection, a bacteria that sometimes causes bad breath, with a simple breath test. Both are relatively inexpensive. If those come back negative, I may recommend a referral to a dentist for a more thorough cleaning and evaluation. Would you be open to those two tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Two tests. But that’s it. And if they don’t find anything, I’m not paying for anything else. This is ridiculous. Just get it over with. And tell me how much it's going to cost before you do anything. I'm not getting any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zelina. I completely understand. The saliva test is $25, and the breath test for H. pylori is $50. Total $75. We’ll proceed with those two tests first, and we can discuss the results and next steps if needed. First, we’ll do the saliva test. I just need you to spit into this collection tube. Then, we'll do the breath test which requires you to exhale into this bag after fasting for eight hours. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Eight hours? You've got to be kidding me. I had lunch a couple hours ago. This is a waste of my time. And what if I forget to fast? What then? Look, I already told you, I don’t do well with complicated things. This is getting worse and worse. .
DOCTOR: I apologize for the inconvenience, Zelina. The eight-hour fast is optimal for the breath test, but we can proceed with the saliva test now, and then reschedule the breath test for tomorrow morning, after you've had a chance to fast. For the saliva test, simply spit into this tube until it reaches the fill line. No need to brush your teeth beforehand. Alright, great. I’ll send this sample to the lab. You should receive the results in 2-3 business days. And as we discussed, we will reschedule the breath test for tomorrow, after you've fasted. Do you have any questions or concerns before we finish?
