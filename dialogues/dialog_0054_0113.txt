DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor... Dashevsky, is it? Yes, well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom business. Seems I’m going more often than I used to. It’s a nuisance, really. Old age, I suppose. Though my wife says I drink too much tea. She’s probably right, to be fair.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. Increased frequency of urination can certainly be a nuisance. And your wife might be onto something with the tea – caffeine can have that effect. But it’s good you came in to get it checked out, as there are several things that could be causing it. Could you tell me a little more about how often you’re going?
PATIENT: How often… Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t keep track of such things, you know? It feels like… all the time. Maybe every couple of hours? Less if I’m busy, but then I have to really go. It’s not a dribble, thankfully. It’s a proper emptying, each time. Though… I do get up once or twice at night, which is new. Used to sleep right through. My wife doesn't like that much, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, so every couple of hours during the day, and waking up one or two times at night to urinate. That’s helpful. And you said it’s a complete emptying each time, which is good. Now, aside from the increased frequency and waking at night, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me think. No burning, no pain. Nothing like that. Just… the going. Sometimes it feels like I don't empty completely, even though I think I do. A little bit left behind, perhaps. Hard to say, really. And… sometimes, just a little urge, even right after I’ve gone. Not strong, mind you. Just… there. It's not a big deal, I don’t think. I’ve always had a strong bladder, or so I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or burning, but a sensation of incomplete emptying and a lingering urge after you urinate. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, I’m an old man, Doctor. What doesn’t ache? I’ve got a touch of arthritis in my knees, keeps me from gardening as much as I’d like. And my wife keeps telling me my blood pressure is up, but I don't feel any different. She's the one who handles all the doctor’s appointments, to be honest. Medicare covers most things, thankfully. I can’t remember what the doctor said last time… something about watching my salt intake, I think. But other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees and your wife monitoring your blood pressure. We can certainly look into that blood pressure today. It’s good she’s keeping an eye on things. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. That’s about it, I think. And I was in the hospital once for the flu, many years back. Just a bad case of it. Nothing serious. Didn't even stay overnight, as I recall. Mostly just felt miserable for a few days. I've always been lucky, really. Strong constitution, my mother always said. Though, maybe this going all the time is my luck running out.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child and a bout of the flu. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, yes. Just a little something for my knees, the arthritis. It's a small white pill, I think. My wife gets it for me, fills the little pill box every week. Can’t recall the name of it, though. And… sometimes, if I’m really aching, I take a bit of ibuprofen. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? Nothing fancy. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your knees and ibuprofen as needed. We’ll try to figure out the name of that knee medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat most things. My wife makes a lovely borscht, you know. And I've always enjoyed a good apple. Never had any trouble with pollen, either. I do get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that's just the season, I think. Nothing serious. My wife keeps telling me to take something for it, but I just wave it off. A bit of a sniffle never hurt anyone. I’m a hardy Ukrainian, you know. We’re built tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, you know, and it didn't end well. As for alcohol… I used to enjoy a bit of vodka back in the old country, when I was a young man. But not anymore. My wife wouldn’t allow it. And truthfully, I don't really care for it anymore. A glass of tea is enough for me. Though, she says that’s the problem, as I mentioned before. Too much tea. She’s probably right, to be fair. A nagging wife knows best, they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and limited alcohol consumption. Mostly tea. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now, as are my siblings. My father had… something with his heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. My mother was always healthy, as far as I know. And my wife's family… they all seem to live to be a hundred, if you believe her. Lots of good genes, she says. I don't know much beyond that, to be honest. We didn't talk about such things much when I was growing up. More focused on getting through the day, you know? Hard life it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of heart problems on your father’s side, and longevity on your wife’s side. That’s helpful. Alright, Mr. Segretto, that gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I’m an old man, I’ve been poked and prodded before. Just be gentle with my knees, if you would. They aren't what they used to be. And please, don't tell my wife I'm complaining. She'll never let me hear the end of it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll be as gentle as possible. And your secret is safe with me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but not alarming given your age. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal, strength is good in all extremities. Prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not acutely concerning. Okay, Mr. Segretto. Everything seems generally okay, but the slightly enlarged prostate and elevated blood pressure are things we should address. Given your symptoms – increased frequency, especially at night, and the lingering urge – along with the prostate exam findings, it’s possible you have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s a common condition in men your age. The elevated blood pressure will need monitoring and potential treatment as well.
PATIENT: BPH… Now that’s a mouthful. Is that… serious, Doctor? And what does that mean, exactly? Enlarged prostate… sounds unpleasant. And my blood pressure… I feel fine, you know. Perhaps my wife is worrying too much. I don't like the sound of “treatment.” Does that mean pills? Because I really don't want to take any more pills. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s just old age. Everything aches and rattles a bit these days. Maybe I just need a good rest.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Segretto. BPH, or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, means your prostate gland is enlarged. It’s very common as men age, and it’s not cancer. It’s not immediately dangerous, but it can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – frequent urination, especially at night, and the feeling of not completely emptying your bladder. As for treatment, it doesn't necessarily mean pills. There are several options, and we can discuss what’s best for you. We could start with lifestyle changes – reducing fluid intake before bed, avoiding caffeine, and scheduled voiding. We can also monitor your symptoms for a bit to see if they improve on their own. If those don’t help, then medication is an option, but there are also minimally invasive procedures we can consider if necessary. And you’re right, it could be a combination of things, including just the normal changes that come with age. We want to rule out anything more serious and then manage your symptoms to improve your quality of life. Let's start with some tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and a PSA test to help assess your prostate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more poking and prodding, I suppose. Very well, go ahead. But please, no more digital exams if you can avoid it. Honestly, Doctor, it's a bit undignified for an old man. Caffeine… yes, my wife has been nagging me about the tea for years. Perhaps she’s right. I suppose I could try cutting back. And scheduled voiding… sounds like a lot of work. A PSA test… what exactly does that measure? And will it hurt? I don't like surprises, you know. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is this something serious, or is it just old age rattling my bones? Honestly, I’m starting to think I should have just stayed home and had a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. No more digital exams unless absolutely necessary, I assure you. The PSA test, or Prostate-Specific Antigen test, is a blood test that measures the level of a protein produced by your prostate gland. It can help us assess the size and health of your prostate, and it can also help us rule out other potential problems, like prostate cancer. It’s a simple blood draw, just like any other blood test, and it shouldn’t hurt at all. And you’re right to ask if it’s serious. The PSA test isn’t a perfect test, and an elevated level doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. It just means we need to investigate further if the level is high. We'll discuss the results thoroughly and decide on the best course of action together. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll write you a lab order, and you can get them done at your convenience. While we’re waiting for the results, you can try cutting back on the tea and see if that helps. We can also discuss strategies to manage your fluid intake before bed. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A plan. I suppose that’s better than poking and prodding. Yes, I can try cutting back on the tea. My wife will be pleased to hear that. And I’ll get these tests done. Hopefully, it’s just the tea, and this whole thing is just a fuss about nothing. But if it is something serious… what then, Doctor? Be honest with me. I’m an old man, I’ve lived a long life. I don't want any unnecessary treatments or… complications. Just tell me straight, what are my options? And what are the risks? I need to know what I’m getting into before I agree to anything. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here at all. Perhaps I should have just stayed home and enjoyed my tea. A nice, strong cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know what you’re getting into, especially at this stage of life. If the tests do reveal something more concerning, the options depend on what we find. If it’s a more aggressive form of prostate issue, we would discuss options like active surveillance, radiation therapy, surgery, or hormone therapy. Each option has its own risks and benefits, and we would carefully weigh them together to determine the best course of action for you. Active surveillance involves regular monitoring of the prostate without immediate treatment. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Surgery involves removing the prostate gland. Hormone therapy involves reducing the levels of hormones that fuel prostate growth. It's important to remember that we are not at that point yet. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first and then discuss the results thoroughly. If further treatment is needed, we will explore all options together, taking into account your overall health, your preferences, and your quality of life. I want to assure you that I will be honest with you every step of the way. My goal is to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes helping you make informed decisions about your health. I’ll write you a detailed summary of the tests we’re ordering and a few resources about prostate health. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You’ve explained everything… for now. A lot to think about, a lot of poking and prodding and tests and… complications. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite tired. Alright. I’ll get these tests done. And I’ll try to cut back on the tea. My wife will be pleased to hear that, at least. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. For everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go home and have a lie down. And maybe… maybe just one small cup of tea. Don't tell my wife. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. Get some rest. And don’t worry about the tea – one small cup won’t hurt. I’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
