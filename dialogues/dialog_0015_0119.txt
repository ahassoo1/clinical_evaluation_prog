DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s about a… discharge. A penile discharge, as the receptionist put it. Honestly, I was hoping to avoid discussing this, but… here we are. It’s not mine, you understand. It’s my… companion’s. He’s been a bit unwell.
DOCTOR: A companion’s?
PATIENT: Yes. A… gentleman friend. We’ve been together for some time. He’s not been feeling quite himself lately, and… well, this discharge started a few days ago. It’s… unpleasant. And frankly, concerning. I thought it best to get it checked, though he was rather resistant to the idea. Men, you know. Always thinking they're indestructible.
DOCTOR: Right. I understand. While I typically treat patients directly, and this is… an unusual presentation, we can certainly address your companion’s symptoms. To clarify, when you say a few days ago, can you give me a more precise timeline?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was after the bingo night at the community center. Yes, definitely after. That was… last Tuesday, I believe. So, perhaps four days now? It wasn’t noticeable at first, just a little dampness. But it’s become… more prominent since then. And he’s been… quieter than usual. Not his cheerful self, at all. Honestly, I had to insist he let me schedule this appointment.
DOCTOR: Four days, following bingo night. And a change in his usual demeanor. Is he experiencing any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, he’s not one to complain, you understand. Very stoic. But I have noticed him… fidgeting a bit. And he’s been rather… careful when he sits down, if you catch my meaning. He winces sometimes. No outright complaints of pain, but certainly discomfort. And no, I haven’t noticed any itching specifically. Though he has been rather… preoccupied with keeping things “tidy”, if you will.
DOCTOR: “Tidy,” alright. And has he had any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’ve noticed. He doesn’t run a temperature easily, bless him. And no chills, not that I'm aware of. He’s been a bit… lethargic, perhaps? Spending more time napping than usual. But he is getting on in years, you understand. A man needs his rest. Body aches… that’s difficult to say. He doesn't complain about those sort of things. He just… sits. A lot. Honestly, I worry he's just making a fuss over nothing. Men will be men.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to be thorough, has he had any changes in his urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits… now that you mention it… yes, actually. He’s been going to the… bathroom rather more frequently than usual. Not a large amount each time, mind you, just… more often. And he seems to strain a little. He wouldn’t admit it, of course. Very proud, that man. But I’ve noticed. And… well, there's a bit of an odor. Not terribly strong, but… different.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency, straining, and a noticeable odor. Thank you for that information. Now, has he had any sexually transmitted infections in the past, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a delicate question, Doctor. I really don’t think so. We’ve… been discreet, let's say. And he’s always been very careful. He wouldn’t brag about such things, naturally. I’ve never heard him mention anything of the sort. He’s not that kind of man. Not at all. I highly doubt it, honestly. It’s just… upsetting to even think about.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to conduct a physical examination. I understand this is… a sensitive situation, but it’s necessary to determine the cause of his symptoms. Would you mind if I examined him now?
PATIENT: Oh. That. Well… I hadn’t anticipated that. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, be gentle. He’s a bit… sensitive, you understand. And he doesn’t care for strangers touching him. It’s… awkward, to say the least. I suppose… but could you explain exactly what you’ll be doing? I need to be prepared to… to reassure him.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll need to visually inspect the area, check for any inflammation or discharge, and I’ll likely collect a urine sample. There may be some mild discomfort, but I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I may also need to take a swab for further testing, if indicated. The testing will help determine the cause of the discharge and allow me to prescribe the appropriate treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A swab? Oh, dear. He really won’t like that. He’s… particular about his personal space. And a urine sample… will he need to… perform in front of you? That’s… rather undignified. Honestly, Doctor, are you certain this is necessary? Couldn’t we just… prescribe something? A strong antibiotic, perhaps? I just want to make this as… painless as possible for him.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your concerns, but I cannot prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. A urine sample and, if necessary, a swab are essential to determine the cause of his symptoms. Prescribing antibiotics blindly could lead to antibiotic resistance and may not even address the underlying issue. As for performing the sample, I can provide a sterile container and allow him some privacy to collect it. However, I may need to verify its integrity. We are professionals here, and I assure you, I will maintain his dignity throughout this process. We must proceed with the examination to provide him with the best possible care. Are you prepared to assist me in this?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. You’re quite insistent, aren’t you? I suppose… I suppose I have no choice. He’ll grumble, of course. He always does. But I’ll explain it to him. A sterile container, you say? And you might need to… verify it? I hope this won’t take long. He gets very… agitated when he has to wait. And please, be as quick as possible. I’m not sure how much more of this I can take. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well. I have a sterile container here. I’ll leave you both some privacy to collect the sample. Once you’re ready, please let me know, and I’ll return to conduct the examination. And Ms. Wartick, please ensure he understands the importance of a clean-catch sample—that is, he should cleanse the area before collecting the urine. I'll also need a brief medical history from him, if possible. Do you have a list of any medications he currently takes?
PATIENT: A clean-catch sample… honestly, the indignity of it all. Very well. I’ll explain everything. A medical history… that will be difficult. He doesn’t remember much these days, bless his heart. Medications… let me think. He takes something for his… water retention. And a little something for his arthritis, when it flares up. I have a list somewhere… in the kitchen, I think. I’ll… I’ll fetch it. Give us a moment, Doctor. A long moment, if you don’t mind. He’s not a quick study, you understand.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Wartick. I’ll be here when you’re ready.
