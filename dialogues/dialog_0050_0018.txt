DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 56 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Westly Verbos, that is correct. Well, it’s… rather difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, I believe. It’s been… a while now, and it’s becoming a bit bothersome, honestly. I’m not entirely sure why it’s happening, and I thought it best to have someone take a look.
DOCTOR: “Quite a lot,” you say. Could you elaborate on that, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. Hmm. Well, let me see… normally, I would go perhaps… three or four times a day? And now… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more. And it's not just during the day, either. I've been… getting up at night, you see? Which is… not ideal. I find myself quite tired during the day as a result. It’s just… a constant need to go.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, both day and night, disrupting sleep. And you say this has been going on for “a while now”?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. It’s… difficult to say exactly how long. Perhaps… a month? Maybe two? Time… it slips away, you know? It hasn’t been sudden, not a change overnight. It’s been… gradually getting worse, I suppose. I don't keep meticulous records, if that's what you’re asking. Just… more and more frequent trips to the… facilities.
DOCTOR: A gradual increase over a month or two. And are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. No burning, either. It's not… uncomfortable, precisely. Just… the frequency. It feels… normal when I am going, if that makes sense. It's just that I'm going so often. Perhaps a little… weaker stream than usual, now that you mention it. But no pain, no burning, just… a persistent need to empty my bladder.
DOCTOR: No dysuria, no burning. Weakened stream noted. Alright, Mr. Verbos. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst levels?
PATIENT: Thirst levels… That’s a good question. I suppose… I have been drinking more water, yes. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. It’s been quite warm lately. But now that you mention it… perhaps I am drinking a bit more than usual, even when it's not so hot. It's difficult to say definitively, you see? I try to stay hydrated, but... I hadn’t really connected that to anything.
DOCTOR: Increased fluid intake. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, or noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss… No, not intentionally. I don't believe so. Perhaps a pound or two, but nothing significant. I haven’t been feeling particularly hungry lately, if that’s what you mean. But I haven’t been trying to lose weight, and I haven't changed my diet drastically. I still enjoy my… well, my meals. But perhaps a smaller portion here and there. It's not a conscious thing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: No intentional weight loss, slight decrease in appetite. Now, Mr. Verbos, do you have any family history of diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. My mother… yes, I believe she had something like that. Diabetes, yes. She needed… injections, I think. It was many years ago, and I wasn't particularly involved in her medical care. My father… no, I don’t recall any issues with him. And as for kidney problems… no, not that I am aware of. It’s rather difficult to say, you see. My family… we didn't discuss these things much.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of diabetes. Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just… over-the-counter things now and then, for a headache perhaps. Nothing serious. I’m generally… quite healthy, you see. Or, I was, before this… problem started.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, no regular medications. Alright, Mr. Verbos. I'm going to need to perform a quick physical examination now. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Examination table, you say? Yes, perfectly alright. I trust it's not too… involved?
DOCTOR: Nothing too involved, Mr. Verbos. Just a routine check. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also need to perform a digital rectal exam. This is to assess your prostate. It's standard procedure for someone presenting with your symptoms.
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? I see. Prostate, you say? Well… if it’s necessary, Doctor. I… wasn't expecting that. Is it… unpleasant? I apologize, I’m not very familiar with… these procedures. Is there any particular reason why it's needed with… this problem?
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary step, Mr. Verbos. An enlarged prostate can often cause frequent urination, particularly in men your age. It’s a common issue. As for unpleasantness, it is… not comfortable, but it’s quick and provides valuable information. It allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. Now, if you’ll just lie on your side…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you say it’s necessary… Please… be quick, if you would. And… gentle, as you said. I trust you have… everything prepared?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. I’m finished. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Now, let’s listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, normoactive bowel sounds. Alright, Mr. Verbos, you can sit up now.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Is that… serious, Doctor? What does that mean, precisely? And… no nodules, you said? That sounds… positive, doesn’t it? So, what happens next?
DOCTOR: An enlarged prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia , is common as men age, Mr. Verbos. The absence of nodules is reassuring – it suggests it’s less likely to be anything more concerning. However, an enlarged prostate can still cause the urinary symptoms you’ve been experiencing. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen blood test. The urinalysis will check for any infection, and the PSA will help us assess your prostate health further.
PATIENT: Urinalysis… and a PSA test. Infection… you mean there might be something else causing this? And what is a prostate-specific antigen? Is it… painful to take the blood? What kind of results would be… concerning? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I’m… rather worried.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, it’s standard procedure to rule out other possibilities. An infection is always a consideration. As for the PSA, it’s a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated level can indicate prostate enlargement, but also other conditions. The blood draw itself is routine, very minimal discomfort. A concerning result would necessitate further investigation, potentially including imaging or a biopsy. However, let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll start with these basic tests and go from there. I'm writing a requisition for you now. You can have those done at the lab just down the hall.
PATIENT: Imaging… and a biopsy… Very well, Doctor. Down the hall, you say? So, if the PSA is… elevated, what does that mean precisely? Is it… always something serious? I understand you don't want me to jump to conclusions, but… it’s difficult not to worry, you see? It's just… my mother… she had… issues.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, an elevated PSA doesn't automatically mean cancer. Many factors can raise the level, including prostate inflammation, age, and even recent ejaculation. It simply indicates a need for further evaluation. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly when we have them. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. You mentioned your mother… and issues?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. She had… diabetes, I believe. And… complications. She needed a lot of care towards the end. It was… difficult. That’s why I’m so… anxious, you see? Anything to do with… these areas… it brings back unpleasant memories. I just want to make sure… it’s nothing serious. And that I can… manage it, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Verbos. It’s natural to be anxious, especially given your mother’s experience. We’ll proceed methodically and address any concerns you have along the way. Now, the lab results typically take a few days. I’ll have my nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or significant difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. Fever, chills… and difficulty urinating. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything… and for not dismissing my concerns. I suppose I’ll… go to the lab, then. And wait for the results. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Verbos. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: .
