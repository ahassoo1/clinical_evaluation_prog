DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I've… well, I’ve gained a significant amount of weight recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It's quite concerning, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Concerning, yes. Weight fluctuations can be indicative of… a number of things. And you say no changes to your routine?
PATIENT: No changes at all, Doctor. I eat the same foods, the same portions. I walk every day, same route, same length of time. My husband says it's as if I’m… well, he joked I was getting wider by the hour, but it’s not a laughing matter. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It began, I would say, approximately six months ago. It was gradual at first, barely noticeable. But over the last three months, it's been… quite rapid. Perhaps ten pounds a month, or even more. I haven't weighed myself every day, you understand. But I can feel it in my clothes, and my husband has noticed, of course.
DOCTOR: Ten pounds a month… Right. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this weight gain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I have been rather… fatigued, I suppose. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And my hands… sometimes they feel a bit cold, even indoors. But other than that, no. No changes in appetite, no swelling, nothing like that. Just the weight and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and cold hands… Have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin? Not really… perhaps it's a little drier than usual, now that you mention it. But I live in a dry climate, and I've always had somewhat sensitive skin. It could just be the weather. I use a good moisturizer, you understand. Nothing drastic.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some more pertinent questions. Any family history of thyroid problems, diabetes, or… metabolic issues of any kind?
PATIENT: Oh, my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something with her thyroid, I believe. She was always very frail and needed medication. I don’t recall the specifics, sadly. My father's side… no, not that I’m aware of. He was a very robust man, always active. But my mother’s side… there was always a bit of… fragility, I suppose. Would that be relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be. We will need to investigate. Now, do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any regular medication. Just an occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps. But nothing consistent. I prefer to… manage things naturally, when possible. I take a multivitamin, of course, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Primarily, I’d like to assess your thyroid gland, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and listen to your lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. I understand that is standard procedure. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I do hope you find something that explains all this. It is… unsettling to not know what is happening to one’s own body, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, relax. Deep breath in… and out. Heart rate is a little elevated… lungs are clear. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. Skin is dry to the touch, as you mentioned. We will need to run some blood work to ascertain what is going on here. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid hormone levels, your blood sugar, and a complete metabolic panel.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Very good. Blood work, you say? I suppose that is to be expected. Will it be a lengthy process to get the results? And is there anything I should avoid doing before the test? I do have a bridge game scheduled for Friday, and I would prefer not to cancel it if possible.
DOCTOR: The lab work itself is quite straightforward, Ms. Selbitschka. As for delaying your bridge game... I advise against any strenuous activity for 24 hours. Otherwise, it shouldn't interfere. The results typically take 3-5 business days to return. The lab requisition is being printed now. You will need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. No food or drink, except water. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly, Doctor. Fasting for twelve hours, no food or drink, except water. I can certainly manage that. Friday’s bridge game is safe, then. Good. So, I simply take this requisition to the lab, and they will draw the blood? Is there anything else I need to be aware of? A specific time of day is better, perhaps? Or a particular lab you recommend?
DOCTOR: Any certified laboratory will suffice. The timing is not critical, but I suggest scheduling it first thing in the morning. And frankly, Ms. Selbitschka, I have other patients waiting. Take this to the lab, follow the instructions, and we will discuss the results when they return. Do you have any further questions right now?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, I understand. No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and your thoroughness. I shall… proceed with the blood work immediately. I apologize for taking up so much of your valuable time. I hope we can determine the cause of this soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. A nurse will escort you to the lab. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any unusual symptoms prior to our next appointment. Goodbye, Ms. Selbitschka.
PATIENT: Goodbye, Doctor. Thank you again. .
