DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this… breathing. When I lie down flat, it gets hard. Like something’s pressing on my chest. It’s been happening for… oh, maybe a month now? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And it only occurs when you’re lying flat?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sitting up, or even leaning back a little, it’s fine. But flat… no. It feels… constricted. I haven't changed anything about my routine, as far as I know. I eat the same, sleep the same. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been interfering with your sleep at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have to sleep with… well, with a lot of pillows. Two, sometimes three, propped up against the headboard. It’s not very comfortable, but it’s better than feeling like I can’t breathe. It’s a bit awkward, really. I haven’t told anyone.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No coughing, no wheezing. My ankles do swell up a bit sometimes, at the end of the day, but I always figured that was just… old age. It hasn’t gotten worse recently, if that makes any difference. I just wanted to get this breathing sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. My doctor back home – Dr. Alistair, lovely man – he always said my heart was strong. I had a checkup every year, and he never found anything. I’m divorced, you know, and I lived alone for a long time. I had to be sure of things. It's just this breathing now, and I'd like to get it checked.
DOCTOR: And what about any history of high blood pressure or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother, she had high blood pressure, yes. She was a bit… stubborn, wouldn’t take her medicine. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had the sugar sickness. But that was a long time ago. I try to eat healthy, you know. Mostly salads and fish. I don’t drink soda. I’ve always been careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual. A little something for my arthritis in my hands, but that’s it. And no, no allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. It just feels… unnatural.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check for any swelling in your legs. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. The sooner we get this sorted, the better. I do have an appointment with the library board this afternoon, so I’m a little pressed for time, but I can spare a few minutes. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat here. I’m going to start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. I hear a slightly rapid rate, but no murmurs or extra sounds. Breathe deeply again… and out… A few scattered crackles in the lower lobes, bilaterally. Not particularly concerning at this point, but we’ll need to investigate further. And there is some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. This, combined with the crackles in your lungs, suggests possible fluid retention.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Fluid retention… is that serious? My mother had swelling in her legs too, near the end. Is that what this is? I don’t want to end up like her. Could it be… the pillows? I’ve been using quite a few, as I said. Is it possible I’m just… making it worse?
DOCTOR: The pillows are unlikely to be causing this, Ms. Vanderwiele. While they might offer temporary relief, they don't address the underlying issue. We need to determine why you’re retaining fluid. It could be related to your heart, your kidneys, or even a protein deficiency. I’m going to order a few tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. We’ll also need an EKG to assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh. Tests. Alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I’d like to know what’s going on. And how long will these tests take? I really do have that library board meeting this afternoon. I’m the treasurer, you see, and it’s rather important. I don’t want to cause any delays. I do have a driver taking me home. Can he pick up the results? I really do hate to fuss, but…
DOCTOR: The tests should be relatively quick. The blood work will take about ten minutes, and the X-ray won't take long either. As for the results… it depends on how busy the lab is. I can have them faxed to your primary care physician, Dr. Alistair, if you prefer. And no, your driver cannot pick them up directly; we have strict patient confidentiality protocols. It's best if Dr. Alistair contacts you directly. I'll write up the orders now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll be expecting you. And Ms. Vanderwiele, please avoid lying flat until we have a better understanding of what's going on. Continue sleeping propped up with pillows.
PATIENT: Alright. Faxing them to Dr. Alistair sounds fine. That’s probably best. And yes, propped up with pillows. I’ll do that. I understand about the confidentiality. I just… I really do appreciate you seeing me so quickly, Doctor. It’s a relief to finally be getting this checked out. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go find this lab now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will guide you through the process. Let me know if you have any trouble locating it. And Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Try to remain calm. Anxiety can exacerbate these symptoms. I will contact Dr. Alistair with the results as soon as they are available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. Calm. I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. .
