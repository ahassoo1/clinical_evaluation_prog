DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Andraca, huh? Sounds… foreign. Anyway, I’m here 'cause… well, it’s hard to breathe sometimes. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too. Real dry. It’s been… a while now. Don’t remember exactly when it started. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint when things started, especially as time goes on. “Foreign” is perfectly alright, sir, I was born in Venezuela. Let's focus on getting to the bottom of what's going on. So, the shortness of breath and the dry mouth and eyes… is this happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Venezuela… that’s… South America, right? Listen, it comes and goes. Mostly when I’m… doing stuff. Walking, you know? Or… thinking too hard. Sometimes just sitting here! It’s… annoying. I used to be able to do anything. Traffic work is hard when you can’t catch your breath.
DOCTOR: Yes, Venezuela is in South America. And I apologize for interrupting your train of thought, sir. It's good you’re noticing when it happens. So, it sounds like it's related to activity – walking, even thinking can bring it on. “Traffic work” – are you a traffic controller?
PATIENT: Traffic technician. Not one of those guys yelling at people. I… fix the lights, the signals. Used to, anyway. Now… I mostly supervise. Too much walking around, checking things. It’s… complicated. You wouldn’t understand. All those new computers… give me a headache.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that to me, sir. And you’re right, it is complicated – I may not understand the specifics of traffic technology, but I do understand how frustrating it can be when your body doesn't cooperate. It sounds like you’ve been a traffic technician for quite some time. Now, when you say “walking around,” how far would you say you typically walk before you start to feel short of breath?
PATIENT: A long time. Too long. Everything's different now. Walkin’… not far. Maybe… across the parking lot? Or… up a small hill? It used to be nothing. I could walk all day. Now… I gotta stop. And the mouth… always dry. I drink water, but it doesn't help much. It’s just… old. Everything’s just… old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when your body changes and things you used to do easily become difficult. So, across the parking lot or up a small hill is when you notice the shortness of breath. And the dry mouth persists even with drinking water. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shortness of breath and dry mouth?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired… real easy. Even after sleepin'. And… sometimes my ankles swell up. Not all the time. Just… when it’s hot. Or… when I’ve been sittin' too long. Don't remember much else. Everything feels kinda… blurry sometimes. Maybe that’s just the age, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue even after sleeping, ankle swelling in the heat or after prolonged sitting, and some blurry vision. Those are all important things to know. And it’s good you’re sharing these details with me, even if you think they might be “just the age.” Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what? Diabetes? No, I don’t think so. Never been told. Doctor before… just gave me pills for my knees. Old knees. Heart… maybe? I had a little… flutterin’ once, a long time ago. Didn’t seem serious. Just a little thump-thump. That was… decades ago. Everything's a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known history of high blood pressure or diabetes. A brief episode of palpitations decades ago. Alright. And do you take any medications currently, besides the pills for your knees?
PATIENT: Just the knee pills. White ones. I think. Doc just told me to take ‘em. I don’t remember the name. Can’t keep track of things anymore. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach. Heartburn. It gets bad with all the… spicy food I like. Small blue pills, maybe? Everything’s a blur, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so knee pills and something for heartburn. We’ll get the names of those sorted out shortly. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes when I’m around… flowers? But that’s just a little sniffle. Nothing serious. I eat everything. I used to eat a lot of shellfish, but… I don’t eat much anymore. Gets expensive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Guilds, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and looking at your ankles. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. My time ain’t free, you know. All these doctors… always poking and prodding. But… alright. Do what you gotta do. Just… be gentle. Old bones, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. I’m listening to your heart now… I hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but we’ll want to investigate further. And your lungs… I hear a little bit of crackling, particularly in the lower parts of your lungs. And finally, your ankles… there’s a little bit of swelling here. Alright, Mr. Guilds. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard and seen, it sounds like we need to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on. I'm concerned about your blood pressure, the murmur I heard, and the fluid in your lungs and ankles. We’ll start with a blood test and a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Just what I needed. Blood… and… X-rays? You ain't gonna… turn me into a monster, are ya? Listen, I don’t like needles. And I don’t like… radiation. But… alright. Do what you gotta do. Just… hurry up. I got things to do. But what are you lookin’ for, exactly?
DOCTOR: No, sir, we won’t turn you into a monster! The blood test will help us look at your kidney function, check for any signs of infection, and rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. The chest X-ray will let us see your lungs and heart more clearly, and help us understand what might be causing the crackling sound I heard and the fluid buildup. We’re looking to rule out things like heart failure, pneumonia, or other lung conditions. It’s a standard procedure, and the amount of radiation from an X-ray is very small. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: Heart… failure? Now you're scaring me. I ain't dyin', am I? I still got things to do. Traffic… needs supervisin’. Pneumonia… that’s what old people get, right? Bad cough? I don’t have a cough. Just… tired. And… dry. Very dry. Look, just… tell me straight. Am I gonna be okay? No fancy doctor talk, just… yes or no.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, it’s understandable to be worried when you hear those terms. It's too early to say definitively whether you have heart failure or pneumonia. The tests will help us figure that out. Right now, your symptoms could be related to a number of things. To answer your question directly… I don’t believe you are in immediate danger. But we do need to investigate these symptoms to make sure we can get you feeling better and prevent any serious complications. That’s why we’re doing the tests. It's better to be cautious and thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Cautious… thorough… sounds expensive. Listen, I'm on Medicare. You ain't gonna send me a bill I can’t pay, are ya? I got a fixed income. Traffic work don’t pay what it used to. But… alright. If you say I ain’t dyin’, I guess I’ll let you poke around some more. But hurry up. And… be gentle. Still old bones, remember?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask about the cost, sir. Medicare will cover the tests we're ordering, and we'll make sure to file everything correctly. You won't receive a bill you can't afford. And I promise, we’ll move as quickly as possible. I understand your concern and I'll be as gentle as possible throughout the process. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain everything to you as well. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And… maybe a glass of water? My mouth feels like… sandpaper. That’s all. Just… water. Then… let’s get poked. And… be gentle. Really gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I’ll get the nurse to bring you a glass of water right away. And I promise, we’ll be as gentle as possible. Nurse Ramirez, could you please bring a glass of water to room three and let me know when you're ready to draw Mr. Guilds’ blood?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up. Traffic ain't gonna supervise itself. And… tell that Ramirez girl to be careful with that needle. Old bones, remember? I don't want to bleed all over the place.
DOCTOR: I will, sir. I’ll make sure to let her know to be extra careful. She’s very experienced and gentle, but I’ll remind her about your concerns. It shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, try to relax. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: .
