DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Welcome. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my… my son, I think? He signed me up for somethin’. A tryout. For… sports. Old man tryouts, he called it. I mostly just walk these days, ya know? Tourist stuff. I forget what sport it was now, though. Something with a ball, I think? My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Murph. It sounds like your son is trying to get you more active, which is wonderful. And it’s perfectly normal for memories to become a little fuzzy as we get older. So, you went to this tryout… and is that where you started feeling unwell, or did something happen before that?
PATIENT: No, no, I feel alright. Mostly. Just… old. Ya know? A little stiff. I ain’t felt sick, exactly. Just… they want me to get checked out before I… do stuff. Before I try this sport thing. My boy, he worries too much, always has. He said the doctor needs to make sure my… insides are okay? I don't really understand all that. What kinda checkin' are we talkin' about?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a standard check-up to make sure you’re healthy enough for increased activity, which is very thoughtful of your son. “Insides being okay” usually means we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and probably do some blood work to get a better picture of how things are functioning. We might also check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh boy… I don’t like needles much. But… if it means I can make my son happy… and maybe play a little sport… I guess so. What'll happen with the blood? And what kinda stuff are ya lookin' for when ya listen to my heart? I always thought my heart was okay. Beats regular, as far as I know. It's just… gets tired sometimes when I walk uphill. Does that mean somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be a little anxious about needles, Mr. Murph. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The blood work will give us information about your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things – just routine checks. And getting tired walking uphill… that can mean a few things. It could be just normal age-related changes, or it could be a sign of something else. That's what we’re here to figure out. When I listen to your heart, I’m listening for any unusual sounds – murmurs, extra beats, things like that. It’s just a quick listen, no need to worry. First, let’s get some basic information. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… My doctor back in Miami, he said somethin' about my blood pressure bein' a little high once. But he just told me to watch the salt. I mostly just got regular checkups, ya know? Old man stuff. Nothing too serious. I had a bad knee once, playin' baseball when I was a kid, but that healed up a long time ago. And… oh! I had the flu pretty bad a few years back. But that was just a bad flu. Does that count? I mostly just take a little somethin' for aches and pains when I need it. What kinda "little somethin'" are ya askin' about? I forget the name. It's a white pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, a past knee injury, the flu, and a white pill for aches and pains… that’s helpful. Do you remember when you were diagnosed with high blood pressure, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly…? Oh, goodness. That was… a while ago. Maybe ten years? More? I moved from Miami about five years ago, and I think it was before that. I used to see Doctor Ramirez, a nice man. I think he gave me somethin' for the blood pressure then, but I stopped takin' it when I moved. It didn't seem to bother me much. I mostly just try to take it easy now. Is it bad that I stopped takin' it? My son’s gonna be mad if he finds out. He always tells me to listen to the doctors.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Murph. We'll figure everything out. Stopping medication without talking to a doctor isn’t ideal, but it's not uncommon. We can check your blood pressure today, and if it's elevated, we can discuss restarting medication or other options. It’s good that your son encourages you to take care of your health. Now, about this white pill you take for aches and pains… Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, the dosage… No, I just take one when I need it. Sometimes two if my knee is really botherin' me. It comes in a little orange bottle. I think I got it at the drugstore, ya know? Over-the-counter. Not a prescription. It helps, mostly. But it don't last too long. I mostly just try to rest when I’m achin'. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it. Does it matter what kinda pill it is? I never really paid much attention.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know you’re taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, Mr. Murph. It’s good that you try to rest when you’re achy. It does matter what kind of pill it is, as some can interact with other medications or have side effects. Do you happen to remember the brand name or anything else written on the bottle?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… The bottle… it’s got a picture of… leaves on it, I think? And maybe a mountain? It's a little faded. I think… it starts with a “N”? No, “M”? Oh, goodness. My memory is terrible. It’s a little orange bottle, that’s all I remember for sure. My wife usually gets it for me. She’s better at rememberin’ these things. She’s visitin’ her sister right now, that's why I'm here all by myself. Maybe she wrote the name down somewhere? I'll ask her when she gets back.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Murph. Don’t worry about it. We can try to figure it out later. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a problem with food. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm out in the garden, but that's just the flowers, I think. And pollen. Never had a bad reaction to a pill, as far as I remember. My wife always checks that kinda stuff when I get a new prescription, though. She's very careful. I just tell her I trust her. Does pollen count as an allergy? I just sneeze a little.
DOCTOR: Sneezing from pollen is a common allergy, Mr. Murph. So, no known medication or food allergies, that’s good. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My father smoked, but he quit when I was a little boy. Terrible habit, he always said. Always coughin’. I never liked the smell of it. No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife doesn’t smoke either. We always try to be healthy, ya know? Mostly. I do like a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: A glass of wine with dinner is perfectly fine, Mr. Murph. Now, how about alcohol use?
PATIENT: Oh, just that one glass with dinner, mostly. Sometimes two if it's a special occasion. I don't drink beer or hard liquor. Just wine. My wife and I both enjoy a nice glass of wine with our meals. It helps us relax. It's not every night, though. Maybe three or four times a week? Is that too much? My son always worries about these things. He's a very careful young man.
DOCTOR: That sounds moderate, Mr. Murph. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, can you tell me about any big medical events in your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That's a tough one. My mother, she had a bad heart. She passed away when I was still pretty young. And my father, he had… I think it was diabetes? He had trouble with his legs. And my sister, she had… some kinda cancer, I think? It was a long time ago. My wife remembers more of these things. She keeps track of all that stuff. Is it important that I don't remember exactly what they had? I just know they weren't very healthy. It's why I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: It’s alright that you don’t remember the specifics, Mr. Murph. Knowing that there was a history of heart problems, diabetes, and cancer in your family is helpful. It doesn't mean you'll develop those conditions, but it's good to be aware. Alright, Mr. Murph, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds good. Just… try to be gentle, okay? My ribs get a little creaky sometimes. And don’t be surprised if I flinch when ya touch my knee. Old baseball injury, ya know? Still bothers me every now and then. But otherwise, go ahead. I’m ready when ya are. Let’s get this over with. Hopefully, I can go back to relaxin' soon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Murph. I will be as gentle as possible. And I’ll be careful with your knee. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. It can fluctuate, so we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. I hear a slight murmur, Mr. Murph. It’s not too concerning, but it’s something we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Your ears and throat look fine. Now, let me just check your reflexes… Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Everything seems okay overall, but I’d like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work again…? Oh, boy. But… if ya think it's necessary, I guess so. My son will be happy to hear I’m gettin’ it done. Is it gonna be a lot? And will it hurt? I really don’t like needles, ya know. But… if it means I can keep playin' tourist, I’ll do it. Just… try to be quick, okay? And maybe I can close my eyes? Will that help? What exactly are ya lookin' for in the blood this time?
DOCTOR: It’s not a lot of blood, Mr. Murph, just a few vials. And yes, closing your eyes will definitely help. We'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. We're looking for a complete blood count to check your red and white blood cells, your cholesterol levels, your blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things. It will help us get a better understanding of your overall health, especially since you're planning on being more active. I'll write the order for the lab work now. The nurse will come in shortly and take you to get your blood drawn. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… remind me again what the murmur means? Is it bad? Should I be worried? My son is gonna be askin’ all sorts of questions, I just know it. He worries so much. And… will this blood work tell us if my knee is gonna be okay? It's been botherin’ me for years. I just want to be able to walk without pain. That's all. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Murph. The murmur is a slight unusual sound when I listen to your heart. It doesn't necessarily mean there’s something wrong, but we want to investigate it further just to be sure. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying issues. As for your knee, it won't tell us exactly if it will be okay, but it can help us rule out any inflammation or other issues that might be contributing to your pain. We can also discuss physical therapy or other treatments if needed. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions you have, and please, feel free to call the office if you have any concerns after you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Murph. Take care.
