DOCTOR: Right. Kerriann Purtee, age 49. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed a change in my… body smell, I guess you’d call it. It’s not… bad, exactly, just different. Not like sweatier, just… off. I can't quite place it. It started maybe a month ago?
DOCTOR: A change in body odor. Alright. It's not always embarrassing to discuss these things, it's a medical symptom like any other. A month ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. I thought maybe it was the detergent I was using, so I switched brands, but it didn’t help. It seems to be… constant, not just after working hard. I do a lot of physical labor with my job, you know, laying floors, so I am sweaty sometimes, but this is different than usual.
DOCTOR: Right. Constant, even when you haven’t been exerting yourself. And you've already ruled out a change in laundry products. Okay. Before we get into anything more… dramatic, let’s cover some basics. Do you notice it all over, or is it localized to a specific area – underarms, feet, anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I think… mostly under my arms, yeah. And maybe a little bit… down there? Not a strong smell, but I noticed it when I was showering this morning. It’s definitely not my feet, I wear good work boots and change socks regularly. It's just… present. It's not overpowering, but I know it's there. It's enough to make me a little self-conscious, which is why I finally came in.
DOCTOR: Alright. Underarms, potentially the genital area as well. Not overpowering, but noticeable enough to cause concern. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this, like any discharge, itching, redness, or sores in those areas?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No itching, no redness, no discharge, nothing. Just the smell. I haven’t noticed any other symptoms at all. It’s really just the odor. It’s not… fishy or anything, it’s hard to describe. Almost… musky, I guess? But not like perfume musky, just… different than my usual scent. Is that even a thing, having a 'usual scent'? Sorry, I'm probably being silly.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being silly at all. Everyone does have a baseline scent, and noticing a change is perfectly valid. "Musky" is…helpful. Alright. Let's rule out some simpler things first. Do you have a fever, night sweats, or have you lost any weight recently without trying?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely no night sweats. And no weight loss. Actually, if anything, I’ve gained a little weight lately, it's been hard to get to the gym with work. Work is pretty physical, as I mentioned, and tiring. I usually just collapse in bed when I get home. No, no fever, no night sweats, and no weight loss. I eat pretty regular, maybe a little too much comfort food some days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss. Physical labor, collapsing in bed afterward. Okay. We're going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your underarms and… the relevant area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on. It’s just been unsettling, you know? And I don't want it to be something serious. Go ahead, please. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat on the table. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and hold it… good. Now exhale. Repeat that a few times. Heart rate is normal, lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let's take a look at your underarms. Please raise both arms above your head. No visible rash, redness, or swelling. No palpable lymph nodes. Now, I'm going to need to examine the genital area briefly. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Everything is fine so far. Yes, go ahead. Please be gentle, thank you. It’s a little sensitive, sometimes, from… the work. Just let me know if you see anything unusual. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: No visible lesions, discharge, or obvious signs of infection. Skin appears normal, though slightly irritated as you mentioned. Alright. Physical exam is unremarkable. No clear external cause for the change in odor. Given your history and exam, it's unlikely to be something serious, but the persistent nature of the smell warrants further investigation. There are a few possibilities we need to consider. One is a condition called bromhidrosis, which is essentially excessive or altered body odor. It can be caused by bacteria breaking down sweat, and sometimes it requires specific treatment. Another possibility, though less likely given the lack of other symptoms, is a hormonal imbalance. Finally, it could be a diet-related issue, though you haven't reported any significant dietary changes. To rule out a hormonal imbalance, I'd like to order a basic blood panel, including thyroid function and hormone levels. We can also do a skin swab to identify the type of bacteria present. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay. That… makes sense. I hadn’t even thought about hormones. A blood panel and a skin swab… yes, I'm comfortable with that. I'd rather be thorough, you know? And figure out what’s going on. It's just been hanging over my head, worrying me. So, yes, please. Blood panel and skin swab. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast for the blood work? And where do I get the skin swab done?
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. I’m glad you're comfortable with that. For the blood panel, yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – no food or sugary drinks, but water is fine. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab at [clinic name] – it’s just down the hall, room 203. The skin swab will be done here, in the clinic. I’ll collect a sample from your underarm using a sterile swab. It's quick and painless. We’ll send both samples to the lab, and the results should be back in about 5-7 business days. Once we have those results, we can discuss a treatment plan if necessary. In the meantime, continue practicing good hygiene – regular showering with antibacterial soap, wearing breathable clothing – and try not to worry too much. These things are often easily managed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. Fasting for 8-12 hours, antibacterial soap, and breathable clothing. I can do that. Room 203 for the blood work, you said? And you'll do the skin swab here. Perfect. No, I think that answers everything, actually. Thank you very much. I feel a little bit better just knowing we’re looking into it. It was starting to really bother me. So thank you for listening and not making me feel silly about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It’s never silly to address health concerns, and I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. We’ll be in touch as soon as they’re available. Here’s a handout with some general information about body odor, and the clinic’s contact information. Have a good day, Kerriann.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. You too. .
