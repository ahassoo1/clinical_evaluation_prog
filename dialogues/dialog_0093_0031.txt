DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And the nurse mentioned something about… my heart not beating right? I’ve been feeling a bit off, and this leg is just… big. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling in one leg can be concerning, and the nurse informed me of some irregularities detected during your initial assessment. It’s good you came in to have it checked out. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, I thought I’d just bumped it on something. But it’s gotten worse each day. Now it’s… well, quite noticeable. It doesn’t hurt exactly, just feels… heavy. And warm, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over a week, no sharp pain, but a feeling of heaviness and warmth. That’s helpful information. Has anything specific made it worse – standing for long periods, exercise, or perhaps any recent injury, even a minor one you might have forgotten?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. I’ve been doing a bit of marking for my students, so sitting down a lot… but no extra standing or anything. And definitely no injuries. I’m quite careful, usually. I’ve not been exercising much either, to be honest, it’s been too warm for that. Perhaps the sitting isn't helping? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Prolonged sitting can sometimes contribute to swelling, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let’s talk about what the nurse mentioned regarding your heart. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, palpitations – that’s a fluttering or racing sensation in your chest – dizziness, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, I have been a bit… tired, yes. More tired than usual. And I have been feeling a little breathless when I walk up the stairs, but I thought that was just the heat. And… now that you mention it, sometimes my chest feels a bit… fluttery. Not all the time, but it happens. It doesn't last long. Is that… bad? I’m not sure I understand what 'palpitations' means exactly.
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad that you're asking questions. It's good you're being thorough. Palpitations are essentially awareness of your heartbeat – feeling it beat faster, stronger, or irregularly. What you’re describing – the fluttering sensation – sounds like palpitations. Alright. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a physical exam. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check the swelling in your leg. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… please don't make me lie down if you can avoid it. I don’t do well lying flat. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely keep you seated. I'll just need to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and then I'll examine your left leg. Okay, Nixon. Your heart sounds… slightly irregular, a bit faster than I’d expect at rest. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. And your left leg is indeed warmer and noticeably swollen compared to your right. I also notice some mild tenderness to the touch. Do you feel any pain right now when I press here?
PATIENT: It's… a little bit uncomfortable, yes. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache. Like a bruise, but not quite. It’s more when you press here, on the back of my leg, near my knee. It doesn’t hurt when you touch the top part, just the back. And it’s not constant, just when you press on it. Is that… important? I'm starting to feel a bit worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is important, yes, and it’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling worried. That tenderness, along with the swelling and the irregularity in your heartbeat, suggests we need to investigate a bit further. Given your symptoms and my initial examination, I suspect the possibility of deep vein thrombosis, or DVT – a blood clot in a deep vein, often in the leg. It's important to rule this out, as it can be serious. To do that, we'll need to order a D-dimer blood test, which can help detect the presence of a blood clot. We will also need an ultrasound of your left leg to visualize the veins and confirm or rule out a clot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. An ultrasound and a blood test… yes, alright. Whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong. I… I don’t know what a D-dimer is, but if it helps, then please do it. Will the ultrasound… hurt? And how long will it take? I have some marking to do, you see. Though, I suppose my health is more important.
DOCTOR: You are right to prioritize your health, Nixon. And it’s good you’re asking questions. A D-dimer is simply a blood test that measures a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. It’s a very common test. The ultrasound is completely painless. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and move a probe over your skin. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood for the D-dimer, and then schedule you for the ultrasound as soon as possible. While we’re waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend you avoid prolonged sitting or standing, and elevate your left leg whenever possible. Do you have any allergies to medication, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no, I’m not taking any medications. Not even over-the-counter things regularly. Just… the occasional paracetamol for a headache, but that’s all. I’m quite healthy, usually. This is all very… unexpected. Will the results take long? And what if it is a blood clot? What happens then? I’m probably asking too many questions, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Nixon. You’re asking excellent questions, and it's important to be informed. It’s my job to provide you with that information. The D-dimer results usually come back within a few hours. If the D-dimer is elevated, it suggests the possibility of a blood clot, and the ultrasound will help us confirm that. If a blood clot is confirmed, the treatment typically involves anticoagulant medication – blood thinners – to prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of complications. We'd discuss the best option for you and monitor you closely. In some cases, compression stockings are also recommended. It is a serious condition, yes, but it is very treatable. Before we proceed, is there any family history of blood clots, or any recent surgeries or long periods of immobility?
PATIENT: Oh. That… sounds a bit scary, the medication. But if it helps, then I suppose. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something wrong with her legs when she was old. I don’t know what it was, but she was in hospital for a bit. And… I did have a wisdom tooth out about six months ago. It was quite a simple procedure, nothing major. I was fine afterwards. Just… a bit sore. Is that relevant? I really don’t want to be on medication if I can avoid it. It makes me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Nixon. A recent surgery, even a minor one like a wisdom tooth extraction, can slightly increase the risk of blood clot formation. And the family history is also important. Given your grandmother’s history and the recent procedure, it's even more important we get a definitive diagnosis and rule out any concerns. I'll order the D-dimer and ultrasound immediately. Nurse, could you please draw a D-dimer for Nixon and schedule an ultrasound of her left leg as soon as possible?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I… I suppose there’s nothing else to do but wait, then. I will try not to worry too much. Though, it’s difficult. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any symptoms that mean I should come back immediately? I don’t want to make a fuss, but… I'd rather be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask. It's always better to be safe. While we're waiting for the results, please watch out for the following symptoms: Sudden worsening of leg pain or swelling. Warmth or redness in the leg. Shortness of breath or chest pain. Coughing up blood. If you experience any of these symptoms, please come to the emergency room immediately. Do not hesitate. I will also call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, continue to elevate your leg and avoid prolonged sitting or standing. Do you have any questions about anything we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I will keep a close eye on my leg and watch out for those symptoms. And I will try to take it easy. Thank you for your help. I… I feel a bit better knowing that you’re taking it seriously. I'm glad I could reassure you. And remember, if anything changes, don't hesitate to contact us. The nurse will escort you to the lab for your blood test.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Please let the nurse know if you have any concerns. Take care, and I will be in touch soon.
