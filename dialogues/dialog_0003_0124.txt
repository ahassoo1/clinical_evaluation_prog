DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Paes. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yackey, nice to meet you. Well, for the past few months, my skin has been getting darker, and I've just been feeling really tired all the time. It’s…it’s hard to explain. Like, not just needing a nap tired, but really worn out, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Darker skin” and fatigue… vague symptoms, frankly. Could you be more specific about the skin changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… Specific… okay. It's all over, not just one spot. And it’s not like a sunburn tan. It’s…more of a brownish tone, I guess? And it seems to be getting a little…thicker in some places, if that makes sense? Like, not puffy, but…noticeably different than before. It's hard to say exactly where it's thicker, just… overall. Does that help at all? I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Brownish tone, generalized…and thickening. Right. And you mentioned fatigue. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most exhausted you’ve ever felt, where would you rate your typical energy level these days?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… a scale. Okay. Hmm… I'd say… maybe a three or four? On a good day, maybe a five. But most days it's closer to three. It takes a lot to get going in the morning, and I feel like I could sleep for hours and still be tired. It’s… it's affecting things, you know? I used to enjoy gardening, but now I just don’t have the energy.
DOCTOR: Gardening… and a consistent fatigue of three to five. Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really, I don’t think so. I haven't been sick, no fever or anything. My appetite is okay, maybe a little less than usual, but nothing major. I haven't lost any weight that I know of. Oh! My hands have been a little shaky sometimes, but I thought that was just because of… well, I don't know, getting older maybe? Is that something I should mention? I feel silly even saying it.
DOCTOR: "Shakiness"... and decreased appetite. We'll document everything, Ms. Paes. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. No food allergies, no problems with medicines…nothing. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I have Medicare, if that helps? I don’t know if that’s important for this.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. And no known allergies. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing serious. Just…high blood pressure, maybe ten years ago? The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. It wasn't bothering me, and I didn't like feeling…fuzzy all the time. I know I probably shouldn't have, but… I haven't really had a check-up since then. I feel bad about that. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Discontinued medication for hypertension... Not ideal, Ms. Paes. And you haven't seen a doctor in ten years. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had anything like that. Just the usual…wisdom teeth out when I was young, but that was ages ago. Nothing else. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, honestly. My mom… she had a lot of problems, and I just… it wasn't a good experience watching her. Sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: We'll document that. Now, briefly, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, um… my mom passed away a few years ago, like I said. She had… heart trouble, mostly. And my dad… he died when I was young. I don’t really know much about his side of the family. I have a brother, but we don’t talk much anymore. He lives… far away. He had some problems with his liver, I think, but I’m not sure. I don't really have much medical history on either side of the family, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much. Does that help? I feel like I'm not being very useful.
DOCTOR: Minimal family history… documented. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to drink a little wine sometimes, with dinner, but I stopped a long time ago. It made me feel…off. And definitely no drugs. I've never been interested in any of that. I like to keep things simple, you know? Just…healthy living as much as possible. Though, clearly, something isn't working right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Paes. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure, and then I’ll take a look at your skin. I suspect we need some blood work to determine what might be going on.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Blood work sounds… sensible. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Please, sit. 150 over 90. Elevated, as expected given your history. Now, let's examine your skin. Please extend your arms. Increased pigmentation, diffuse. Some thickening noted. I’ll need to palpate other areas as well.
PATIENT: Okay. I do notice it's darker on my hands too, especially on the palms. And I guess… it feels a little rougher there. Like sandpaper almost? Is that…normal? I’m probably making this all up.
DOCTOR: Rough texture noted. We'll need to order some lab tests. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a liver function panel. Also, I want to rule out any iron deficiencies and vitamin D insufficiency. The lab results will take a few days to come back. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive sun exposure and keeping your skin moisturized.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A few days, you said? And avoid the sun… that’s good advice, I guess. I do like gardening. I understand. So, a follow-up appointment… when would that be? I have a friend who… well, she helps me out with things, and I need to make sure I’m available. It's just…getting around isn’t always easy.
DOCTOR: We can tentatively schedule you for August 9th at 2:00 PM. If that doesn’t work, my assistant will contact you to reschedule. I have several other patients waiting. Do you have any further questions immediately relevant to the tests I've ordered?
PATIENT: August 9th… that might work. Okay, yes, one question. Is there anything… anything I should be worried about? Like, what sort of things would these tests even show? I know I shouldn’t ask, but… my mind is just racing a little. And… is this something serious, in your opinion? I just need to know if I should be… panicking.
DOCTOR: Ms. Paes, I understand your anxiety. However, speculating without concrete data is unhelpful. The tests will help rule out various possibilities, including thyroid dysfunction, liver problems, iron deficiencies, and vitamin deficiencies. The skin changes, in conjunction with your fatigue, could be indicative of several conditions. It’s premature to be concerned at this stage. I will interpret the results and discuss them with you thoroughly at your follow-up appointment. Until then, avoid excessive sun exposure and maintain a healthy diet. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, contact my office immediately. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Avoid the sun, healthy diet… got it. Thank you, Dr. Yackey. I’ll… I’ll see you on the 9th.
