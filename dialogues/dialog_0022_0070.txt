DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor… Tosca, yes? It’s… a visit. A check-up, I think. New in town, see? Medicare said I needed to find a doctor. Everything feels… official. I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… doing what I have to do.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Szmyd. Getting established with a new doctor is always a good idea, even if you're feeling well. And yes, it can feel a bit… official, I understand. So, to start, let’s just go over a bit of your history. I see here you’re 58 years old. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Fifty-eight, yes. Though sometimes I forget… what was I saying? Oh, yes. Fifty-eight. It feels… a long time. Everything feels a long time now. Is this important? All this… numbers and dates.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Szmyd, but don't worry about remembering everything perfectly. We'll take our time. Knowing your age helps me understand what’s normal for you and what things to look out for. And it’s perfectly normal to feel like time is moving faster as we get older. Let's try this. Have you been generally healthy, or have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant… problems? I used to pull very long hours, you know. Work with… faces. Makeup. Theatrical things. Always running around. Backaches sometimes, yes. And my hands… they get tired. But problems… I don’t know. Nothing a little rub didn’t fix. Divorced, you know. That was… a problem. But not a medical problem. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, some backaches from work and tired hands. We can definitely talk about those. And I understand that personal life events can be very stressful, and those can definitely impact your health. When you say you worked with faces and makeup, what kind of work were you doing exactly?
PATIENT: Ah, the theater! Yes. I made the faces. You know? For actors. For performances. Big productions, sometimes. Little ones too. I had a good eye. A steady hand… well, used to. It was… demanding work. Long hours. Lots of travel. I… I don’t remember all the details. It was a long time ago. Very busy. Very important people. Does it matter what kind of plays?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily matter what kind of plays, Mr. Szmyd. Knowing you worked in theater, doing makeup work, gives me a better understanding of what might be causing some of your current symptoms. It sounds like it was physically demanding work. Now, thinking about your health more generally, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what did you say? Pressure? No, no. Never. I always felt… strong. I ate… normal food. Maybe a little too much sometimes. Heart problems… my ex-wife had some issues, yes. Very dramatic. But me? No. I smoked… a little. Years ago. But I stopped. I think. It's all very blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no diagnoses of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems. You did smoke in the past, but you’ve stopped – that’s good to hear. And it’s understandable that memories get a little blurry over time. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. The doctor back home gave me something for my… well, it was a little ache. In my shoulder. But I don’t remember what it was called. A small blue pill, maybe? I stopped taking it. It didn’t do much. And vitamins… sometimes I take something for my… joints. But I forget to be honest. My daughter used to remind me, but she moved away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small blue pill for shoulder pain that you stopped taking because it wasn't effective, and occasional vitamins for your joints. It’s good you remember that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat… everything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that's just… the weather. Old skin, you know? I used to work with a lot of chemicals, for the makeup. Maybe it's from that? I don’t remember ever having a bad reaction to anything. Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It’s possible the occasional itchy skin is related to your past work with chemicals, that’s good to keep in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. That’s… complicated. My mother… she was always frail. Weak heart, I think. But she didn't go to doctors much. Very stubborn woman. My father… he was a strong man. Worked in a factory. I don’t think he ever got sick. And my sister… she moved to America. Haven’t spoken to her in years. I don’t know what’s happened to her. It’s all very… distant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history can be difficult to recall. It sounds like your mother had some heart issues, and your father was generally healthy. That’s helpful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… what do you mean? I used to go to the theater, of course. With the actors. Lots of parties. Very glamorous. But that was a long time ago. Now… I mostly stay home. Read books. Watch television. It’s quiet. I used to be married, but… we divorced. It wasn’t a good match. Very difficult woman. I don't have much… social life, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I meant. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you enjoy a quiet life at home now. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will just be a basic check-up to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh… alright. If you must. I haven’t had one of those in… years. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I get a little… nervous, you know? With people poking around. But… alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I'll be as gentle as possible. It won’t take long, and I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Palpate? What does that mean? Is it… painful? Oh dear. Look, maybe we don’t need to do everything. Just the blood pressure and pulse. That sounds… reasonable. I don’t like people poking around. It makes me uncomfortable. Blood pressure and pulse… and then we can talk, yes?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. We can absolutely start with just your blood pressure and pulse. Palpate just means I gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. We don't have to do that if you're not comfortable. Okay, your blood pressure is 145/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. That blood pressure is a little elevated, which we can discuss. Now, can I just listen to your heart and lungs quickly?
PATIENT: Elevated? That doesn’t sound good. What does that mean? Is it serious? My ex-wife always had low blood pressure. Very dramatic. Look, just… be quick, alright? My heart’s probably fine. I used to walk everywhere. The theater, you know. Lots of walking. But… alright. Go ahead. But don't poke too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of your lungs. It could be due to a number of things, and we may want to look into that further. Lungs sound clear otherwise. Okay, that's all for now. Based on what we’ve discussed, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I heard some mild crackles in your lungs. Considering your past smoking history, it would be good to get a chest x-ray to get a better picture of what’s going on. Do you think that would be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh dear. Is it… dangerous? I don’t like radiation. Is it really necessary? I feel fine, mostly. A little tired, yes, and my back aches. But… x-rays sound serious. Can’t we just… talk about it? Maybe take some pills? I don’t like hospitals. Or… machines. What kind of pills would you recommend?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. An x-ray uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of getting a clearer picture of your lungs outweigh the risks in this case. It's a quick and painless procedure. We could discuss medication, but without knowing the cause of the crackles in your lungs, it's difficult to recommend the right treatment. It's important to understand what we're dealing with before prescribing anything. To be clear, the crackles could be caused by something minor, like a previous cold, or something more serious, like a mild infection. The x-ray will help us determine the cause and ensure we get you the right care. Would you be open to scheduling an x-ray at the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Clinic… you mean I have to come back? More poking around? And waiting rooms… filled with sick people? Look, maybe it’s nothing. Just… old age. My mother always coughed. Perhaps it’s hereditary. I really don’t think I need an x-ray. Can’t we just… monitor it? I’ll try to cough less. And maybe take some vitamins. Do you have any good vitamins for… old lungs?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Szmyd. However, because of your smoking history and the presence of crackles in your lungs, I strongly recommend we get a chest x-ray to rule out anything serious. It’s a precautionary measure to ensure your health and well-being. To address your concerns, we can schedule the x-ray at a clinic with a dedicated waiting area to minimize your exposure to sick individuals. The procedure itself is very quick and painless. Regarding vitamins, there aren't specific vitamins for "old lungs," but Vitamin D and C can help support overall lung health. However, they won't address the cause of the crackles. If you're still hesitant about the x-ray, we can discuss a referral to a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, for a second opinion. Would that be something you'd be interested in?
PATIENT: Pulmonologist… another doctor? Oh dear. It sounds… complicated. And expensive. I'm retired, you know. Medicare only covers so much. Look, can't we just try some pills for now? For the cough? Something to clear my chest? And then we can see how it goes? I really don't like hospitals. Or doctors. It all feels… overwhelming. Just… something simple, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about costs and wanting to avoid unnecessary procedures, Mr. Szmyd. We can definitely start with some medication to help alleviate your cough and see how you respond. However, please understand that without knowing the underlying cause of the crackles in your lungs, it’s difficult to prescribe the most effective treatment. We may still need to consider further investigation if your symptoms don't improve. I can prescribe a mild cough suppressant and a bronchodilator to help open your airways. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely over the next two weeks. If your cough worsens, or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A suppressant… alright. And something for the… airways? Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Two weeks. I can try that. But if it makes me feel worse, I want to stop immediately. And I don’t want any complicated side effects. Just… simple, alright? No poking. No hospitals. Just… pills. And then we’ll see. Are these pills expensive? And will Medicare cover them?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll start with a simple approach – a cough suppressant to ease your cough and a bronchodilator to help open your airways. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely, and you can stop the medication immediately if you experience any adverse effects. The cost of the medication should be relatively low, and most Medicare plans cover these types of prescriptions. I will send the prescriptions electronically to your preferred pharmacy, and they can verify your coverage details. Okay, I’ve sent the prescriptions to [Pharmacy Name]. They should be ready for pick-up within the next few hours. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and instructions on how to take the medication. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: [Pharmacy Name]? I don’t think I’ve ever been there. It’s probably far. Oh dear. Well, I suppose I’ll have to figure it out. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… simple pills. And try not to cough too much. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And don't worry about the pharmacy – we can help you find a more convenient location if needed. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
