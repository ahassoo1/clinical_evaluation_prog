DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s this heat, see? Can’t stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Painting houses, building fences… you name it. Now? Sweat like I'm drowning after ten minutes. It’s… it’s just not right. Never been like this before.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it is been a particularly brutal summer. It’s good you're getting this checked out, though. Just because you used to be able to tolerate it doesn't mean your body isn't telling you something now. So, tell me a bit more about this sweating. Is it all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Certain areas, definitely. Mostly my face, you know? And under my arms, of course. But my hands get clammy too, even when it's not that hot. And... well, my chest sometimes. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. A man shouldn't be glistening like that all the time. Not a good look. It’s not just the sweating either, though. I feel… weak. Sort of dizzy sometimes. Like I need a lie down. It’s getting worse, you understand?
DOCTOR: Weakness and dizziness with the excessive sweating… Right. And when did this start, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started gradually, maybe… April? Around then, I reckon. It wasn't much at first, just a bit warmer than usual, a little more sweat. Thought it was just my age catching up with me, you know? But it's been getting worse every week since. May was bad, June even worse, and now… well, now it’s a proper nuisance. Makes it hard to get anything done. Can’t concentrate when I'm feeling faint all the time. And the wife… she keeps telling me I should slow down, but a man’s got to work, doesn’t he?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a man should listen to his wife, sometimes. It’s good you're taking this seriously now, though. Let’s get some more information. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Not really. I eat the same as always, maybe a little less now because I don’t feel up to big meals when it’s hot. But the scales don’t lie, do they? Been around the same for years, give or take a pound or two. I’m a solid build, always have been. Never been one for skinny, thankfully. But honestly, doctor, I don’t think it’s my weight. It’s this heat, it’s… draining the life out of me. I tell you, back in Nepal, the heat was different. Dry heat. This is… sticky. Oppressive. Makes everything worse.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll need to consider everything, Mr. Coby. Now, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. My stomach’s been a bit off, now and then. Not proper sick, just… unsettled. And I’ve been… thirstier, I suppose. Always been a bit of a tea drinker, but now I’m going through bottles of water. And… oh, yes! My hands shake a bit sometimes. Not all the time, just… when I’m tired. Like a little tremor. It’s probably nothing, just old age, I tell you. But it's all happening at once, isn’t it? It's… worrying. And frankly, I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. So, stomach upset, increased thirst, and a tremor when fatigued… Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. Had a bit of trouble with my back years ago, from all the lifting, but that's sorted now. The doctor gave me some pills, fixed it right up. Bit of high blood pressure, I think he said, but it’s controlled with medication. Nothing serious. I'm a strong man, doctor. Always have been. I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I take a little pill every morning. White one, small one. Can’t remember the name of it, honestly. Don’t bother with names, just take the pill. And that’s it. No other medications. I eat well, mostly. Avoid the sweets, you know? Too much sugar is bad for you. And I don’t drink much. A little beer with my dinner sometimes, that’s all. Nothing excessive. I’m a sensible man, doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix out. That's all. A quick job, in and out. Didn't bother me much. Nothing else. Just the appendix, years ago. And a bit of trouble with my back, but that wasn’t a surgery, just… treatment. That’s it. No other surgeries. I’m a healthy man, doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father, he had a bit of trouble with his heart, later in life. High blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she just got old, you know? Frail. It happens. Not much else, honestly. My brothers and sisters were all healthy enough. No fancy diseases, nothing like that. A normal family, doctor. We just… got old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, before we move on to an examination, I need to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. I’m a strong man, doctor. Nothing bothers me. Though… I get a bit itchy sometimes, after I’ve been working in the garden. But that’s just the plants, you know? Nothing serious. No proper allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to conduct a physical examination. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with, then. I haven't got all day, you know. A man’s got things to do. Just… be quick about it. I’m a patient man, but I haven’t got forever.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please sit back and relax as much as possible… Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Coby. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but I detect some mild wheezing. Reflexes are normal. Coordination is slightly impaired, but within acceptable limits. I notice a slight tremor in your hands when you extend them. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper quadrants. No masses detected. Alright, Mr. Coby. Based on my examination, your symptoms and findings are concerning. We need to run some tests to determine the cause.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I told you, I’m a healthy man! What’s there to test? Waste of time, if you ask me. Can’t you just give me something for the sweating? Something to calm me down? I haven’t got time for tests, doctor. I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration, but it’s crucial we identify the cause of your symptoms before I prescribe anything. We need to rule out several possibilities. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid function test, and an EKG to assess your heart function. We should also check your cortisol levels. These tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying medical condition causing your symptoms, such as diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, or a heart problem. We also need to rule out any adrenal issues. It’s possible there’s something affecting your hormone levels. It’s not simply about “calming you down,” Mr. Coby. It’s about ensuring your health and wellbeing. I’m concerned about the possibility of several conditions. It’s better to be thorough than to simply mask the symptoms without addressing the root cause.
PATIENT: Hormones? Adrenal issues? What are you talking about? I’m a man, not a woman! Never had any trouble with hormones. This is ridiculous, doctor. Absolutely ridiculous. You're just making things up now. I tell you, it’s the heat. It’s this oppressive, sticky heat. It’s draining the life out of me. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I haven't got time for all these tests. I need to get back to work. I've got a deadline to meet. Just give me something for the sweating and let me get on with it. Or, better yet, just tell me it's the heat and send me on my way.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, with all due respect, I cannot simply dismiss your symptoms as being “just the heat.” You're experiencing significant weakness, dizziness, and tremors, in addition to the excessive sweating. These are not typical symptoms of heat exhaustion. Ignoring these could have serious consequences. I understand your concerns about time and your workload, but your health is paramount. I strongly recommend we proceed with the blood tests and the EKG. It's a simple procedure, and it will give us valuable information. If you absolutely refuse, I will document your refusal in your medical record. However, I cannot in good conscience provide treatment without a proper diagnosis. I will also strongly advise you to seek a second opinion. Perhaps we can compromise. I can order the most essential tests – the complete blood count and the comprehensive metabolic panel – to start. That will give us a baseline. We can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment. But I cannot ignore these symptoms entirely. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, you win. But just the blood tests, you hear? No EKGs, no hormone tests, nothing like that. Just the basic ones. And I want the results quickly. I haven't got time to waste sitting around waiting for weeks. And don’t expect me to come back for a follow-up. If there's nothing serious, I'm going back to work. Don't bother with me unless it's a life-or-death situation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. I’ve documented your refusal of the EKG and hormone testing, as well as your desire for expedited results. I’ll write the order for the complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel now. The lab is just down the hall. They should be able to take the samples right away. I’ll have the results sent to me as quickly as possible. Typically, it takes 24-48 hours, but I’ll emphasize the urgency to the lab technicians. In the meantime, I recommend you stay well-hydrated, avoid strenuous activity, and monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also send you a copy of the lab order and a summary of the recommendations. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just get the tests done and let me get back to work. Stop wasting my time, doctor. I haven’t got all day.
