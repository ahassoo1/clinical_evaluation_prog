DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. A letter came, you see. From the clinic. Said my cholesterol was…high. I don’t rightly understand all that medical talk, but it sounded serious enough to come on down. Hyper-something, was it? That's what it said.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. A rather common ailment these days. Now, do you have any…symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I feel…well, I feel like an eighty-eight-year-old man, if that makes sense! A little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just age, I figure. Nothing specific that made me think something was wrong wrong, you understand? I still get around, still tend to my garden…though not as much as I used to. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Not precisely. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not a bit. Never have had chest pain, really. Though, now that you mention it… sometimes, after a good bit of work in the garden, I get a little…winded. But that’s just getting old, isn't it? It passes pretty quick, though. I usually just sit and have a glass of iced tea and I’m right as rain.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been occurring – this…windedness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now, I suppose. Years, probably. Comes and goes with the weather, you know? Warmer days make it worse. I didn’t think much of it. Just figured I wasn’t as young as I used to be! Is that important, Doctor? Is being winded a sign of this…hyper-lip-i-deemia thing?
DOCTOR: It could be. Though, at your age, many things can cause shortness of breath. Let's move on. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Well, now that’s a good question. Not that I know of, no. I haven't taken a proper medicine in…oh, must be twenty years. Just a little aspirin now and then for a headache, but nothing serious. And I’ve never had a reaction to that. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one who kept track of all that. I don't have a good memory for things like that, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a single one. I've always been one to avoid pills if I could. I figure fresh air and hard work are better for you than anything a doctor can prescribe. Though, I suppose that's just an old man talking, isn't it? I do take a little vitamin D in the winter, the sun isn't what it used to be, but that's it. Just a small dose, my daughter told me to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's perform a brief physical examination then. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible enough. Just let me know if I need to adjust myself, my old bones aren’t as pliable as they once were.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Pulse is 78 and regular. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Respiration is normal, no wheezing detected. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but present.
PATIENT: Diminished, you say? That sounds…old. Everything’s diminished at my age, I suppose. Is that a bad thing, Doctor? My wife used to say I was a bit slow on the uptake, maybe that’s what she meant. Everything’s connected, isn’t it? This hyper-lip-i-deemia…is it going to make me even slower?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, please. It's not about "slow," it’s about assessing your overall health. The diminished reflexes are…consistent with your age. Now, regarding the hyperlipidemia…it can contribute to cardiovascular disease. We need to manage it. Given your age and lack of symptoms, I'm not going to put you on a statin immediately. However, lifestyle modifications are crucial. I recommend a low-fat diet and regular, gentle exercise, as you are able.
PATIENT: Low-fat diet, you say? I do like my bacon, you know. And gentle exercise…I’ve been puttering in the garden for years, is that not enough? My wife used to make a lovely pork roast…is pork completely out of the question? I'm just trying to understand what I need to do here, Doctor. It's a bit overwhelming, all this talk of hyper-lip-i-deemia and low-fat diets.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, I understand your…preferences. Pork is not strictly prohibited, but moderation is key. And while gardening is beneficial, it may not be sufficient to significantly lower your cholesterol levels. We'll re-check your levels in six months. If they haven’t improved, we’ll discuss further options. I’ll have the nurse give you a handout on a heart-healthy diet. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Six months, huh? Well, that gives me some time to think about this bacon situation. I suppose…is there anything specific I should be looking for on this handout? Like, is olive oil good or bad? My daughter keeps saying olive oil is good for everything. And what about eggs? I do enjoy a fried egg with my bacon…when I eat bacon, that is. I don't want to completely change my life here, Doctor. Just…manage this hyper-lip-i-deemia thing.
DOCTOR: Olive oil is acceptable in moderation. And eggs are… permissible, but limit your intake to no more than three per week. The handout will provide more detailed information. Honestly, Mr. Bohnett, I am providing you with general guidelines. It's not my responsibility to micromanage your diet. I believe that covers everything. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide the handout. Do you have any further questions for me now?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. Three eggs a week… I can manage that. Though, it will be difficult. No, I don't suppose I have any other questions. Just…thank you, Doctor. And thank you for being patient with me. I do appreciate it. I'll see the nurse, then. .
