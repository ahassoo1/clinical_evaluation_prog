DOCTOR: Hi Odell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Travel… medicine, you said? Something about… going somewhere. My wife… she liked to travel. Lots. I just… need what she used to get. Shots, I think. Before. For places. I don’t really remember where this time. It's… important, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're looking to get travel vaccinations, similar to what your wife used to receive. That's perfectly fine. It’s smart to get ahead of things. Let's start with a little more detail, if you don't mind. Do you have any idea when and where you might be traveling?
PATIENT: August… yeah, soon. Like… this month. Somewhere warm. Lots of… trees, maybe? My wife… she liked the jungle. I… think. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t make the plans anymore. A friend… he said I need to come here. Before. I just… need the things. To be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, "somewhere warm with trees" this month. That gives us a starting point. And your friend is right to recommend getting things checked out beforehand. To make sure we give you the right things, could you tell me anything else about the trip?
PATIENT: Right things… yeah. He said something about… bugs. Lots of bugs. And… water. Bad water. He said I shouldn't drink the water there. He works with… charities, I think. Sending things to people. He knows about these places. I just… I just want to go. And come back. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potential concerns about insect-borne illnesses and water safety. That's helpful. Do you know where specifically your friend is sending aid?
PATIENT: Uh… no. He doesn’t… tell me much. Something about… Nepal. Is that… close to where my wife used to go? I think… she liked a different part. Mountains, I remember mountains. He just said I should get… the same things she got. Before. Is that… okay? Can you just give me what she got? It was a long time ago. Maybe it’s in the system?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal… and you'd like to see if we have a record of your wife’s previous vaccinations. Let me check our system to see if we have any records for her. It might take a moment. In the meantime, to make sure we cover all our bases, can you tell me about any allergies you have, or any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Allergies… not really. Maybe a little… stuffy nose sometimes. Dust, I think. Or… cats. I don't take any… pills. Nothing. I just… get tired easy. Old age, maybe? I don't know. My wife… she took everything. Little white pills. Lots of them. I just… need to be safe. Like her. Is that hard to do? To look up what she got?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, occasional stuffy nose, no medications. Just fatigue. I'm still searching, but unfortunately, without more information about your wife – like her date of birth or where she received care before – it's proving difficult to locate her records. It’s possible her information isn’t in our system. We can still get you protected. To do that, could you tell me a little more about the specific activities you’ll be doing on your trip?
PATIENT: Activities… I don’t… know. My friend said I’m helping him. Carrying things. To people. Maybe building… houses? I'm not very good at building. Mostly… just staying out of the way. It's hot there, he said. Very hot. And wet. Lots of bugs. Like I said. I just… need the shots. The things she got. So I don’t… get sick. Is it really that hard?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ll be carrying supplies, potentially doing some construction work, in a hot, wet climate with lots of bugs. It's not that it's hard, it's just that different areas require different precautions. Without knowing exactly where you're going, I want to make sure I recommend the most appropriate vaccinations and preventative measures. We usually recommend a travel consultation to determine the best course of action, based on your destination and planned activities. Since we’re having trouble locating your wife's records, and your destination is still somewhat vague, could we perhaps focus on the common recommendations for Nepal?
PATIENT: Nepal… okay. If that’s… what she got. That sounds… right. Mountains, she liked mountains. Is it… expensive? I don’t have… much money. My wife… she handled all that. Just… what do I need? To not get sick. Like her. Just tell me what to get. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal it is. Based on the current guidelines for Nepal, common recommendations include Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis. We also recommend considering Japanese encephalitis, depending on the duration and location of your stay. And, depending on the area you'll be visiting, there's a risk of malaria, so we'd discuss preventative medication for that as well. As for cost, let’s look at each of these individually. I can also check if your insurance covers any of these vaccinations. First, have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… no. Not for… a long time. My wife… she always made sure. I think… I had something when I was a little boy? But I don't remember. Just… what do I need to pay for? Now? Tell me the price. Just the things… for Nepal. The things she got. Is malaria… bad? I don’t want to… be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent vaccinations. We'll treat you as needing all recommended vaccinations for Nepal. Typhoid is around \$150, Hepatitis A is about \$130, and Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis is around \$80. We’d need to discuss the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which is more expensive, around \$200-\$300 depending on the brand. Then there’s the malaria preventative medication, which varies depending on the specific drug chosen and the duration of your stay - roughly \$50-\$100. As for malaria, it can be serious if left untreated. The symptoms are flu-like, but can escalate quickly. That’s why preventative medication is so important. Before we proceed, I want to quickly review your medical history to ensure these vaccinations are safe for you. You mentioned fatigue earlier – has that been a recent development, or something you've experienced for a long time?
PATIENT: Long time. Always… tired. Old age, I guess. My wife… she said I needed more rest. But she… she took care of everything. So I didn't… worry. The money… is that all at once? Can I… pay it later? I just… need to go. And come back. Safe. Like her. I don't want to think about prices now. Just… tell me what I need. To not get sick. Is there a shot for… everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, long-term fatigue. And you're understandably wanting to focus on getting protected, not the costs. We can discuss payment options with the billing department after the consultation. Unfortunately, there isn't one single "shot for everything." Different diseases require different vaccines. For Nepal, based on your planned activities and current guidelines, I recommend Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis as a baseline. We should also consider Japanese encephalitis, and definitely discuss malaria prevention medication, given the potential risk. To determine the best course of action for malaria, I need a little more information. Roughly how long do you anticipate being in Nepal?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t know. A few weeks? My friend… he said a month, maybe? I just… go where he tells me to go. He’s the one… planning everything. I just carry the boxes. To the people. He said it’s important. I don’t want to… cause trouble. Just… what do I need? To be safe? A few weeks… is that long enough to get malaria? I just want to go. And come back. Like her. Is there a shot… for everything bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month. And you’ll be carrying supplies for your friend. Given that duration, the risk of malaria does increase. While there isn’t one single “shot for everything bad,” we can significantly reduce your risk with preventative medication. For a trip lasting a month to Nepal, I recommend the atovaquone-proguanil combination for malaria prevention. It's taken daily and is generally well-tolerated. To summarize, I recommend Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis, and atovaquone-proguanil for malaria prevention. We'll need to schedule you for those vaccinations, and I’ll provide you with a prescription for the malaria medication. Before we proceed, I just want to do a quick physical exam to make sure you’re healthy enough to receive these vaccinations. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a lot. Typhoid, Hepatitis, Tetanus… and the other one. Fine. Just… get it done. So I can go. The quicker, the better. Physical… exam? Is that… necessary? I just want the shots. And the pills. To be safe. Like her. Are they… painful? The shots, I mean. My wife… she didn’t like needles. Just… get it over with. Quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to get this done quickly. A quick physical exam is standard procedure before administering any vaccinations, just to ensure everything is alright. It doesn’t take long, I promise. It involves checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick visual assessment. As for the shots, they can cause a slight pinch or stinging sensation, but it’s very brief. We can also use a topical anesthetic cream to numb the area beforehand, if you’d like. Before we begin, could you please roll up your sleeves?
PATIENT: Okay… fine. Roll up… sleeves. Just… get it done. I don’t want to… waste time. I just want to go. And come back. Safe. Like her. Is it… cold? The needles? I don't like cold. Just… quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: It’s not particularly cold, but it can feel slightly cool for a moment. I’ll be as quick as possible. Alright, first one done. Just a little pinch. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… a little pinch. Like you said. Okay. Is that… all of them? I just want to… be done. Can I go now? Soon? I need to pack. My friend… he's waiting. Is it safe… to travel now? After… one shot?
DOCTOR: Not quite yet, just one more vaccine to administer, then we’ll discuss the malaria medication. This one is for Hepatitis A. There you go, second one done. A little pinch again. And that’s all the vaccines for now. You're doing great. It’s important to understand that the vaccines take some time to become fully effective, roughly two weeks. So while you can travel now, you won't be fully protected until then. The malaria medication needs to be started a day or two before your trip and continued throughout your stay, and for a week after you return. Let's discuss that now, and I'll provide you with a prescription. Do you have any allergies to sulfa drugs?
PATIENT: Sulfa… drugs? I don't… know. My wife… she knew all that. I never… took anything. I don't remember. A prescription… what do I do with that? Do I… take it to a store? I just want the pills. To take. To be safe. Like her. Can you just… write it down? So I can go. Is it expensive? The pills? Just… quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies to sulfa drugs. That's good. A prescription is a piece of paper that tells the pharmacist which medication to give you. You take it to a pharmacy – like CVS or Walgreens – and they’ll prepare the pills for you. Here you go. Take one pill daily, starting one to two days before your trip and continuing throughout your stay, and for a week after you return. As for the cost, it varies depending on the pharmacy, but it's usually around \$100-\$200 for a month’s supply. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the pills. And… I can go now? Is that… all? Thank you. I need to pack. My friend… he’s waiting. Safe. Like her. Goodbye.
