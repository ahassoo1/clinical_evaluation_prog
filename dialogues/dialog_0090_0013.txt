DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s been a little hard to, uh, go to the bathroom lately. Like, I can go, but it takes a long time, and sometimes… it just doesn't all come out, you see? It’s been going on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And is this… difficult every time, or just occasionally?
PATIENT: Not every time, no. Some days it’s fine, almost normal. But most days now, it feels like… like I have to push a lot harder than I used to. And like I said, not everything comes out. It’s… uncomfortable, to be honest. It’s not painful, exactly, just… stuck. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Stuck, alright. And is there any blood with your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No, Doctor, not that I’ve seen. Nothing like that. Just… the feeling of not being completely empty, you know? It’s… worrying me a little, that’s why I came. I don’t like feeling like something’s still in there. I'm a fairly active man, still do some fishing when I can, and this makes it hard to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the difficulty emptying?
PATIENT: Changes… well, now that you mention it, I guess I am going to the bathroom less often than I used to. Used to be regular, you know? Every morning, like clockwork. Now it’s… spotty. Sometimes one day, sometimes two days in between. I hadn’t really thought about it much until you asked. I just figured it was… getting older, maybe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. Not really any bloating either. I’ve been eating pretty much the same as always… mostly fish, berries when they’re in season, some bread. And no, I haven’t been feeling sick to my stomach at all. I have a good appetite, thankfully. It's just this… emptying problem. It's making me tired, worrying about it all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And let’s go through some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife… God rest her soul… she had some trouble with shellfish, but I never did. I take some vitamins sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing a doctor has ever prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff. I'm pretty healthy, otherwise. I try to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: And what vitamins are those, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… mostly just a multivitamin, you know, one of those for older folks. And sometimes I take a little Vitamin D, especially in the winter. We don’t get much sun here, even in August. It’s just to keep my bones strong, I figured. Nothing fancy, Doctor. I can’t remember the exact brand names, to be honest. I just buy whatever’s on sale at the store.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago, and I recovered fine. And I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder while fixing the roof. But besides that, nothing major. My wife… she had some issues with her heart, but that was her problem, not mine. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. I'm on Medicare, so they have my records, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any family history of colon cancer, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she had some stomach trouble when she was older. I don't know exactly what it was, she didn't talk about it much. And my father… well, he didn’t live a very long life. I don’t remember him having any specific problems, to be honest. We didn’t have doctors much when I was growing up. It was mostly just home remedies and hoping for the best. I’m sorry I can’t be more help. It wasn't something we talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. I think we need to do a physical exam. It’s important to rule out anything serious. I’m going to examine your abdomen and then, unfortunately, we will need to do a digital rectal exam. It's not pleasant, but it’s necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh dear. Well… I suppose if it’s necessary, Doctor. I don’t like the sound of it, not one bit, but I trust your judgment. You think it’s important? I just... I've never had one before. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. But if you think it will help figure out what’s wrong, then alright. Please be… gentle, if you can.
DOCTOR: It is important. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for your symptoms. I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on your back on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen first.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here goes… . Just… let me know when you’re ready. It’s a little cold, isn’t it? I’m not as young as I used to be, and my bones feel everything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Normal bowel sounds. No masses or tenderness to palpation, but I do feel some… slight fullness. Now, for the rectal exam. Please let me know if you experience any pain. I’m going to use lubricant.
PATIENT: Fullness… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Alright, Doctor. Just… just let me know when you’re ready. I'm trying to relax, but it’s a little hard. It’s just… well, it’s not a comfortable situation. I'll try to tell you if anything hurts, but… just be quick, if you can. I appreciate you explaining everything, though. It helps a little, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay. I feel a slight decrease in tone, and some stool present, as expected. No obvious masses, but there is some tenderness on the left side. I’m going to need to order a stool sample to check for blood, and a complete blood count to rule out anemia. And given your age and symptoms, I think it’s best we schedule a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? Tenderness… and a decrease in tone? What does that mean? I haven't had any bleeding, like I said, so blood in the stool… that doesn't sound right. Is it… is it cancer? I’m a bit scared now, to be honest. I just wanted to know why it was hard to go to the bathroom, not… not something like that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, let's not jump to conclusions. Tenderness and decreased tone can be caused by many things, including inflammation or hemorrhoids. A colonoscopy is the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out anything serious, like cancer. It’s a preventative measure. We’re not diagnosing anything at this point. I understand your concern, but the earlier we identify any potential problems, the easier they are to treat. The stool sample will check for microscopic blood, which you may not see with the naked eye. The colonoscopy allows us to visualize the entire colon and remove any polyps if necessary. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Olsen, a gastroenterologist, who will schedule the colonoscopy and discuss the preparation process with you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Olsen… alright. I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to take in all at once. Polyps… are those serious? And what kind of preparation… is it… unpleasant? I’m not a young man anymore, and some things are harder than they used to be. I appreciate you explaining everything, though. It helps to know what to expect. One question… will Medicare cover all of this? That’s a worry, too, being on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: Polyps can be precancerous, which is why it's important to remove them. The preparation does involve drinking a large amount of liquid to clear your colon, it's not pleasant, I won't lie. However, it's only for one day and it's essential for a successful colonoscopy. As for Medicare, yes, they typically cover colonoscopies as a preventative screening for individuals over 50. You may have a small co-pay or deductible, but the majority of the cost should be covered. Our billing department can provide you with more specific information regarding your coverage. I'm going to print out a referral for Dr. Olsen, as well as some information about colonoscopy preparation. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the stool sample and the colonoscopy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Two weeks… and a referral to Dr. Olsen. I suppose I should call and schedule that right away, then. Hopefully, they can get me in soon. And I will ask about the Medicare coverage when I call. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, Doctor. It’s a little scary, but I feel a little better knowing what to expect. Thank you. I’ll see you in two weeks, then. Hopefully, everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Do not hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’ll see what the results show. Take care. .
