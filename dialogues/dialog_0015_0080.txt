DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare’s being… Medicare, you know? Always needs something on paper.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Medicare does have its… peculiarities. But we'll get everything sorted. While we're at it, it would be helpful to have a medical history on file, just in case anything comes up during the form completion process or in the future. It's standard practice. Do you have any current medical complaints, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Not really complaints, no. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I work out on the reservation sometimes, mostly just walking and helping with things. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. I haven't really been to a doctor in… a long while, to be honest. Just trying to stay on top of things now.
DOCTOR: “All things considered” is rather vague, Ms. Fabing. While I appreciate your proactive approach, a lack of recent medical attention doesn’t necessarily equate to good health. It simply means we haven't documented your health. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma?
PATIENT: No, none of those. My mom had some trouble with her blood sugar when she got older, but I don't think I inherited that. And my dad… well, he was always just tough as nails. Didn’t believe in doctors much either. I think that's why I put it off for so long, honestly. But my husband says it's time I get things in order.
DOCTOR: Family history is… noted. While a strong constitution is admirable, it doesn't preclude the development of health issues. It simply means we need to be vigilant. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was little – maybe eight or nine – I fell out of a tree and broke my arm. Had to have a cast, but that's about it. And I had my tonsils out when I was really young, but I barely remember it. Nothing else that I can recall, honestly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. My husband likes to tease me because I'll try anything once. He says I’m too adventurous for my own good.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every now and then. Nothing regular, though. I try to get most of what I need from my food. My grandma always said the land provides, you know? I do use some liniment for my knees when they act up after working outside, but that's it. Mostly just stuff from the store, nothing special.
DOCTOR: Liniment… what kind of liniment, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It's… blue. The bottle is blue. And it says… something about muscle relief. It's just one of those things you can get at the general store, a little local brand. I don't really pay attention to the name, I just grab whatever smells the strongest. It helps, that's all I know. It's got menthol in it, I think?
DOCTOR: "Something about muscle relief" and "a little local brand" is not sufficient information, Ms. Fabing. The ingredients in over-the-counter remedies can still interact with other medications or cause unforeseen problems. Do you have the bottle with you, or can you recall any of the ingredients listed on the label?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't have the bottle with me. And honestly, I wouldn’t be able to read half those ingredients even if I did. They’re always in such tiny print! My husband usually gets it for me. He’s better at that sort of thing. I didn’t realize it was so important. I just figured it was a little rub-on lotion.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, it is precisely because you don’t know the ingredients that we need to ascertain them. It’s a matter of patient safety. Let's move on to a brief physical exam, then. Perhaps seeing your current condition will encourage more detailed recall. Please step onto the scale for me. We’ll start with your height and weight.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Sounds good. Sorry for being so… vague. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize repeatedly. Just stand still, please. Alright. Your height is 171 centimeters, and your weight is 70 kilograms. That gives you a Body Mass Index of… acceptable. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. Heart sounds are regular, slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Now, I’ll just take a look in your ears and throat. Open your mouth and say "Ah."
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Throat is clear. Ears are clear bilaterally. Everything appears… unremarkable. Ms. Fabing, while the physical exam reveals no immediate concerns, I strongly advise you to be more diligent with your medical history and any medications you are taking, even over-the-counter remedies. It is essential for your health. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Just… thank you for your patience. I really do need to get those forms filled out, though. And I promise, I’ll ask my husband to write down all the names of everything I use next time.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the forms prepared for you. And please, Ms. Fabing, don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Consider this a baseline examination. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you with the paperwork.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Have a good day.
