DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation, and I was hoping to learn a bit more about it. See if it might be… helpful, you know? I’m Liza, by the way.
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure to meet you too, Liza. Mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful. It's wonderful you're exploring these options. Just to clarify, are you coming in specifically to discuss learning mindfulness techniques, or is there something else going on that you thought mindfulness might help with?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It's not really… a problem, exactly. I just feel… scattered sometimes. A bit overwhelmed, even though my job isn’t terribly stressful. I repair signals and track switches for the railway, so it’s pretty straightforward work, really. But my mind… it races. I thought maybe mindfulness could help me focus, quiet things down a bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Liza. Feeling scattered and overwhelmed, even without a major stressor, is quite common. It sounds like you’re hoping mindfulness could improve your concentration and reduce mental racing. Okay. Before we dive into techniques, let's get a little more information, just to make sure we’re approaching this in the best way. Have you experienced this "scattered" feeling for a long time, or is it relatively new?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I’d say… probably for the last couple of years. It’s come and gone, really. There were times when I was perfectly fine, very focused. But it feels like it’s been more frequent lately. It’s not debilitating, nothing like that, but… noticeable. I’m 47, so I figured maybe it’s just… getting older? But I’d rather be proactive, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Liza, being proactive is always a good idea. And it could be related to age, or a number of other things. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe what you mean by “scattered”?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s like… I start one task, then I remember something else I need to do, and then something else pops into my head, and I end up jumping between things. I forget where I put my keys sometimes, or what I was even thinking mid-sentence. It’s not… serious memory loss, just… little things. And I feel anxious if I don’t write everything down, like I’m afraid I'll forget something important. It’s frustrating, more than anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty with sustained attention, some forgetfulness, and a bit of anxiety around potentially forgetting things. Okay. Now, let’s do a quick review of systems, just to rule out anything else that could be contributing. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I usually sleep okay. Maybe I toss and turn a bit more than I used to, but nothing major. I get about seven or eight hours most nights. No trouble falling asleep, and I don’t wake up feeling exhausted. I do get up once or twice to use the bathroom, but that's… pretty standard for my age, I imagine?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Liza. Seven or eight hours is excellent. And yes, getting up once or twice a night is common as we get older. Now, how about your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite is fine. I eat pretty normally, I guess. I enjoy cooking, so I try to make healthy meals. Not a huge snacker, really. I haven’t lost or gained any weight recently, if that matters. I’m about 136 pounds and I’m… oh, I think I’m about 161 centimeters tall. Not that that's terribly important.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. No recent weight changes is good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I wouldn’t say I'm sad, exactly. I get a little frustrated sometimes, like I said, with forgetting things. And I do feel a bit lonely sometimes, being single and all, but that’s more of a general feeling, not… a persistent sadness. I have a few good friends, and I see them occasionally. I just wish… I was a bit more organized, you know? And maybe less easily distracted. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Liza. Okay, one last thing for the review of systems. Have you noticed any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, no headaches or dizziness. My vision is fine, I think. I wear glasses for reading, but I've had them for years and the prescription hasn't changed recently. I had my eyes checked last year. Everything seems normal, physically. I’m on Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. They haven't flagged anything unusual.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and reassuring that your regular check-ups haven't revealed anything concerning. Okay, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and measles, but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, but it healed properly. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no major illnesses. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. My parents were both healthy, too, although my mother did have a bit of arthritis when she got older.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Liza. And no significant family history of neurological or psychiatric conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think, but that was managed with medication. And my mother, like I said, arthritis. No one in my family suffered from… memory problems or anything like that. No one was ever… “unstable,” for lack of a better word. It’s a pretty straightforward family, health-wise. Just… normal aging, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Liza. And you mentioned you're on Medicare. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. Just a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. But that’s it. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise, so I don’t really need anything else. I’m a Signal and Track Switch Repairer, so I do a lot of walking and lifting on the job, actually. Keeps me pretty active.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Liza. So, to summarise, you're a 47-year-old female, generally healthy, with no significant medical history, no medications, a stable weight, and good sleep. You’re experiencing some difficulty with concentration and forgetfulness, and a bit of anxiety around those things, but otherwise feel well. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly accurate, Doctor. You’ve got it exactly right. I appreciate you listening so carefully. It’s good to feel… understood, you know? I was worried you’d think I was just being silly, but you’ve taken it very seriously.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Liza. Your concerns are absolutely valid, and it's important to address these things. It sounds like what you're experiencing could be related to stress or simply the normal changes of aging, but we should explore some strategies to help manage these symptoms. Would you be open to discussing some mindfulness techniques, and potentially other options if those aren't enough?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. That’s why I came! I’d love to learn some mindfulness techniques. And I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Where do we start? I’m a bit skeptical, I have to admit, but I’m willing to try. I just don’t know… where to begin with quietening my mind. It feels like a bit of a hopeless task, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Liza. It is challenging at first, and it’s very common to feel skeptical. It’s not about stopping your thoughts, but about learning to observe them without getting carried away. We can start with a simple breathing exercise. It’s called diaphragmatic breathing. Would you like me to guide you through it now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… manageable. Breathing doesn’t sound too scary! I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just… let me know what to do. I’m a bit of a practical person, so… step-by-step instructions would be great.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Okay. So, find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. If you're comfortable, you can close your eyes, or just lower your gaze. Now, place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. We're going to focus on your breath. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose. Notice how your stomach rises while your chest remains relatively still. And then exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your stomach fall. We’re aiming for slow, deep breaths. Let's do that together for a few moments. Inhale… and exhale… Just notice the sensation of your breath. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… odd. I think I'm breathing too quickly. And I'm definitely thinking about my to-do list. It's hard to focus on just… breathing. Is it supposed to be this difficult? I feel a bit silly, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Liza. It is difficult at first! Your mind is used to wandering, and it will resist being focused. The key is not to judge those thoughts, or get frustrated with yourself. Just gently acknowledge the thought, and then redirect your attention back to your breath. It’s like gently guiding a puppy back to its leash. Don’t beat yourself up about it when your mind wanders – it will. It’s the act of redirecting that's important. Let's try that again. Focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. Inhale… and exhale… If a thought pops into your head, just notice it, and gently bring your attention back to your breath. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: It’s… slightly better. I think. It still feels hard to quiet everything down. And I’m aware of feeling… restless. Like I should be doing something. I keep wanting to check my phone. But… I am noticing my breathing a bit more, I suppose. It’s just… a lot to focus on.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Liza. You are doing a great job. And you've identified a key challenge – the restlessness and the urge to check your phone. That's very perceptive. It’s okay to acknowledge those urges, and to simply observe them without acting on them. We're not trying to eliminate them, but to create some space between the urge and the action. Five minutes is a good starting point. We can gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. This exercise, practiced regularly, can help you to develop a greater sense of calm and focus. Would you like me to guide you through a short body scan meditation next, or would you prefer to stick with the breathing exercise for a little longer?
PATIENT: I think… maybe the body scan. Breathing is hard enough! And I keep wanting to adjust my position, which feels counterproductive. A body scan sounds… less active, perhaps? I’m willing to try anything, to be honest. As long as it doesn’t involve too much… stillness. My legs are starting to feel a bit numb.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a good choice, Liza. The body scan is a bit more gentle and can help you to become more aware of your physical sensations. It’s less about stopping thoughts and more about noticing what’s happening in your body. We’ll start with your toes, and gradually work our way up. If you need to adjust your position at any time, please do. Comfort is important. I’ll guide you through it, and you can simply focus on the sensations in each part of your body as we go. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, let's try it. My toes feel… a bit cold. Is that normal? I suppose everything feels a bit cold in this room. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just… tell me what to do. I promise to try my best not to wiggle. Though no guarantees!
DOCTOR: Perfectly normal, Liza. Noticing your toes feeling cold is a good start! That’s exactly what we’re aiming for – simply observing what’s happening in your body without judgment. Now, bring your attention to your toes. Notice any sensations – the temperature, any tingling, any pressure from your socks or shoes. Just observe. There’s no need to change anything. Now, slowly move your attention to the soles of your feet. What sensations do you notice there?
PATIENT: There's… a bit of pressure. And a tingling sensation in my left foot. And a faint ache in my arch, now that I think about it. And they’re both a bit cold. I didn’t realize my feet were so… sensitive. It’s… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s like I’m noticing everything all at once.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Liza. You’re becoming more attuned to your body, and it’s natural to notice sensations you weren't aware of before. It can feel overwhelming at first, but that will subside with practice. Just acknowledge those sensations without judgment. There’s no need to change them. Simply observe. Now, slowly move your attention to your ankles. Notice any sensations there – the temperature, any pressure from your socks or shoes, any tingling. Take your time. There's no rush.
PATIENT: There's… a bit of pressure from my shoes. And a warmth. And… a faint throbbing in my right ankle. It's… surprisingly distracting. My mind keeps thinking about that report I need to finish tomorrow. It's hard to focus on just… my ankles. I think I’m doing this wrong.
DOCTOR: You are not doing this wrong, Liza. Your mind wandering is completely normal. It’s like a muscle that needs training. Each time you redirect your attention back to your body, you’re strengthening that muscle. Don't get discouraged. Just gently acknowledge the thought about the report, and then redirect your focus back to your ankles. There's no need to judge yourself for thinking about work. Simply observe the sensation in your ankles. Now, take a few deep breaths. And as you exhale, allow any tension in your ankles to release.
PATIENT: It’s… a bit easier this time, I think. I’m still aware of the report, but I’m not… obsessing over it. And I can feel the warmth of my shoes. And… a faint pulse in my right ankle. It's… surprisingly calming, actually. Though my legs are starting to feel really numb now. Maybe we should stop soon?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Liza! And yes, let’s stop there. You’ve done a fantastic job. It’s perfectly normal for your legs to feel numb after a while. We’ll keep it shorter next time. Now, gently wiggle your toes and ankles, and slowly bring your awareness back to the room. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: I feel… a bit groggy. And my legs are definitely numb. But… calmer, I think? And slightly more grounded. It was… surprisingly challenging. And strangely pleasant. Though I don’t think I’ll be able to do this for very long anytime soon. Maybe five minutes is enough for now?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Liza. Five minutes is a great starting point! The key is to practice regularly, even if it’s just for a few minutes each day. The more you practice, the easier it will become. We’ve explored a little bit about mindfulness and body scan meditation today. Do you feel like this is something you might want to continue exploring?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It was… difficult, but also helpful. It’s not a magic bullet, I don’t think, but it might be a good way to quiet my mind a bit. And I think I could benefit from being more… present. Maybe I’ll try to do five minutes every morning before work. Though I’ll probably need to set an alarm. Do you have any recommendations for… resources? Books or apps or… something?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Liza! And setting an alarm is a great idea. Consistency is key. There are many wonderful resources available. I recommend the app “Headspace” or “Calm” – they both have guided meditations for beginners. There's also a book called “Mindfulness for Beginners” by Jon Kabat-Zinn, which is a classic. I can also provide you with a handout that outlines some simple mindfulness exercises you can practice at home. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The handout would be great. And I’ll check out those apps. I think I need a bit of guidance, to be honest. It’s easy to get distracted. Thank you, Doctor. This was… surprisingly helpful. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I’m glad I came. Do you… have any other recommendations for dealing with feeling scattered? Besides mindfulness, I mean?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad you found it helpful. Besides mindfulness, keeping a daily planner or to-do list can be very effective for managing feeling scattered. Breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps can also make them feel less overwhelming. And ensuring you’re getting enough sleep and regular exercise is also crucial. Sometimes, simply taking a few moments each day to disconnect from technology and spend time in nature can be very grounding. Also, consider if there are any stressors in your life that you might be able to address directly. Do any of those things resonate with you?
PATIENT: Yes, the planner definitely resonates. I always mean to use one, but… I never get around to it. Maybe I should actually try this time. And the disconnecting from technology… that’s a good one. I do spend a lot of time on my phone, scrolling through social media. Probably not very helpful for quieting my mind. I think I’ll try to make a conscious effort to disconnect more often. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve given me a lot to think about. I think that’s all for today?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. It sounds like you have a good starting point. Remember to be patient with yourself, and don’t get discouraged if you have setbacks. It takes time and practice to develop these skills. I'm happy to discuss this further at your next appointment. I’ll give you the handout now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. A follow-up appointment would be great. I think I need a bit of accountability, to be honest. And maybe you can check if I’m actually using that planner! .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Liza! We can definitely check on the planner. It’s great you’re taking such a proactive approach. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for a follow-up in about a month. I'll see you then. Take care, and have a wonderful day!
