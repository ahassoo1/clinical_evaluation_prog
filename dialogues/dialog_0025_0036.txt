DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban, welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare, you understand? They said I need this before it… begins. It is important, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare… right. A welcome to Medicare visit. It is important to get everything established. So, it’s not necessarily a specific problem you're addressing today, just the required paperwork and baseline assessment. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. No problems. I am… healthy, mostly. I work, you see. Food processing. Very physical work. But they insist on this visit. Waste of time, honestly, but… rules are rules. I suppose. Is this going to take very long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It involves going over your medical history – things like past illnesses, surgeries, family history – and a basic physical exam. It’s just a precaution, Mr. Barban. Even if you feel healthy, it's good to have a starting point. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? No. Nothing… serious. I had the usual childhood things, you know? Chickenpox. Measles, I think. But nothing a doctor needed to… interfere with. Just normal things. I have been very strong, always. I do not get sick easily. What do you mean by "serious"?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "serious" would be things like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, anything requiring ongoing treatment or hospitalization. Did you ever have pneumonia?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… hmm. I remember being very sick once, a long time ago. Very bad cough, fever… I stayed in bed for many days. My mother made me drink a lot of tea. Was that pneumonia? I do not know. It was many years ago, in Yemen. Doctors are… different there. They give you herbs mostly. Not like here. Is that what you mean? A bad cough and fever?
DOCTOR: Okay, a severe cough and fever… that could have been pneumonia, yes. We’ll make a note of that as a possible past illness. It's good we’re clarifying. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I have not been cut open. I am a strong man, I told you. Why would I need to be cut? Is this… normal here? People getting cut open all the time? It sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: No, it's not normal for everyone to have surgery, Mr. Barban. It's only when it's medically necessary. Alright, let’s move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My father… he passed away some years ago. Heart trouble, they said. Not a good heart. Very sad. My mother… she is still alive, thankfully. She is… old now. Living in Yemen. I speak to her sometimes, when I can. She is… small and weak. But very strong spirit, you understand? Is this what you need to know? About their hearts?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Your father’s heart trouble is important to note. Did he have any other medical problems that you know of?
PATIENT: Hmm. He… he was always tired. And he had trouble breathing, especially when it was hot. The doctor in Yemen gave him… some powders, and told him to rest. But he worked very hard, you see. He was a farmer. Very tough life. He did not complain much, even when he was sick. Just… tired, mostly. Is that important? Tiredness? Everyone gets tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Trouble breathing and fatigue… that's something we'll document. It could be relevant. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I do not smoke. It is a terrible habit. Makes you weak. And drink? Never. Not even a little. And those… those drugs… I have no time for such things. I work hard. I need my strength. I eat well. Mostly. Sometimes my coworker brings sweets. But I do not need… poisons in my body. Is this a test? Are you trying to… trick me?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, it’s not a test. I’m simply gathering information about your lifestyle to get a complete picture of your health. It’s routine. Now, regarding your job… you mentioned food processing. Can you describe the physical demands of your work?
PATIENT: Yes, it is very physical. I lift heavy boxes, all day. I stand for many hours. Sometimes it is hot. Sometimes it is cold. Very repetitive, you see? Lifting, moving, packing. I use my hands a lot. My back sometimes aches. But I am strong. I manage. It is honest work. I provide for myself. It is better than… sitting in an office all day. Is that what you want to know? That it is hard work? It is.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My mother always made sure I tried all kinds of foods, even when I was small. Spices, herbs, vegetables… everything. Sometimes my stomach feels a little upset, but that is just from eating too much. No… serious allergies. I have not been stung by a bee. I have not touched poison ivy. I am… a strong constitution, you understand? I do not react to things easily. Is this the last question? I hope so. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the last of the history questions. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a look in your ears and throat. It shouldn't take long. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: An examination? You want to… listen to my heart? Like a mechanic listening to an engine? This feels… unnecessary. But… alright. If it must be done. Do be gentle. I am a strong man, but I do not enjoy being… poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: It's not quite like listening to an engine, Mr. Barban. It’s to listen for any unusual sounds. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let me listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be from talking. Sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Now, your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80. Slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms… Reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. No acute concerns detected.
PATIENT: Unremarkable? What does that mean? It sounds… suspicious. So, you poked and prodded, listened and shone lights… and found nothing wrong? That is… good, I suppose. But I still think it was unnecessary. I told you, I am a strong man. Is this… it? Can I go now? I have things to do, remember? Important things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that concludes the physical exam. “Unremarkable” simply means I didn’t find anything obviously wrong. It's a good thing, believe me. However, since this is your welcome to Medicare visit, I do recommend a baseline blood test to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It's just a standard precaution, to have a starting point for future comparisons. Would you be willing to have that done?
PATIENT: Blood test? More poking and prodding? More… fluids taken from my body? I do not like needles. And I do not see the point. I feel perfectly healthy. But… if it is required… if Medicare insists… then I suppose I have no choice. But I want it over with quickly. And gently. Do you promise to be gentle? This is very important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, I promise to be as gentle as possible. We use the smallest needles we have available. It will be a quick prick, and then it’s over with. The lab is right down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form. It should take about 15 minutes. After that, you’re free to go. Here you go. Take this to the lab technician. They’ll take care of everything. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… Very well. I suppose I can spare fifteen minutes. But do not expect me to be happy about it. And if I feel faint, or if I bleed too much… I expect you to be readily available. Is there anything else? Any other tests you want to perform? Any other fluids you want to extract? No? Good. Then I will be going now. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Barban. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
