DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Radillo, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Gerhard Radillo. It is nice to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? I have been having some trouble with my ear.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Memmolo. Look, we're quite busy. “Trouble with your ear” is…vague. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Yes, of course. I have… liquid coming from my ear. A discharge, I believe you would say. It started, hmm… about one week ago, perhaps a little longer. It does not hurt, but it is… concerning. I keep a clean face, you understand. I do not like things running from my ears.
DOCTOR: Right, discharge. One week. And no pain. Is it…bloody discharge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not bloody. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit yellow, but not often. Like water, but… thicker. It is not a large amount, but it is enough to notice on my handkerchief. I do wipe it away, you understand. I do not want to spread anything.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A small amount. It is difficult to explain. Sounds are… muffled, like someone is speaking with a cloth in their mouth. Not all the time, only sometimes. Especially in the mornings, I think. Or when it is quiet. It is not very bad, but I do notice it. I am a teacher, you understand, and I need to hear clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, dizziness, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And I have not felt dizzy or… what was the other word? Nausea? No, none of those things. I have been eating normally. Sleeping normally. Just the ear discharge, and a small difficulty with my hearing. I do try to stay healthy, you understand. I walk every day.
DOCTOR: Have you had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man, in Somalia, I had an ear infection. A very bad one. It was treated by a… traditional healer. It was many years ago. I do not recall the details very well. And I have not had any problems since then, until now. I believe it was a different ear, though. This is my right ear that is troubling me.
DOCTOR: Right. Any ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm… Yes, sometimes. A very slight ringing. It is not constant. It comes and goes. Like a… very quiet bell, far away. I did not think it was important. It is usually only when everything is very silent. I do not always notice it, you understand? It is not a loud ringing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look. Please, sit. We'll need to examine your ear. Try not to move around.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I will sit very still. Please tell me if you need me to do anything. I do want to understand what is happening with my ear, you understand. It is just a bit… unsettling, having liquid come from it.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild inflammation, and… debris in the ear canal. I see some fluid as well. The tympanic membrane looks intact, but slightly… dull. No visible perforations. It could be otitis externa, a simple ear canal infection. Or it could be something else.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? That sounds… serious. Is that the cause of the liquid, Doctor? And the muffled hearing? Is it something I should be worried about? I do not want it to affect my teaching, you understand. It is very important to me. And is it… contagious? I do not want to spread anything to my students.
DOCTOR: It’s usually not serious, if treated promptly. The liquid and muffled hearing are consistent with it. And no, it’s not generally contagious. Though poor hygiene can contribute. As for your teaching… it could worsen without treatment. I’m going to order a culture to be certain. And I’ll prescribe some ear drops. A topical antibiotic and steroid. Use as directed.
PATIENT: A culture? That sounds… thorough. And ear drops. Yes, that sounds… sensible. As directed, you say? I will be very careful to follow your instructions, Doctor. I do have a daughter who is a nurse. She can assist me if I am unsure about anything. Will the ear drops… sting? I do not have a very high tolerance for discomfort, you understand. And how long will it take for the drops to work? I have classes on Monday.
DOCTOR: The drops might cause a slight stinging sensation initially. It should subside quickly. As for how long they’ll take to work… a few days, hopefully. But finish the entire course, even if you feel better. And yes, follow the instructions precisely. I’m printing a prescription and instructions now. If it doesn’t improve within a week, or if you develop a fever or severe pain, see your primary care physician. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A week… Yes, that is good. I will certainly finish the entire course. And I will see my primary physician if it worsens. Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. You have been… very helpful. I believe that is all my questions. And thank you for seeing me so quickly. It is good to know what is happening, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. Then I have other patients waiting. Get the prescription filled promptly. And try to keep your ear dry. Good day.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Keep it dry. I will fill the prescription immediately. Thank you again, Doctor Memmolo. Good day to you as well.
