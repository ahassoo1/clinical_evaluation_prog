DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing…lapses. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or…a name. It worries me. My blood pressure is…high, the other doctor told me. I hope this is not…serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. “Lapses” – forgetting things, you said. And you mentioned high blood pressure diagnosed by another doctor. We can definitely look into both of those. First, let’s talk about these lapses. How long have you been noticing them?
PATIENT: Perhaps…three months, maybe four? It is hard to say exactly. They were small at first. Now…now it feels like more often. I remember everything else very clearly, you understand. Dates, events…but these little everyday things…they slip away. It is…frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it is frustrating when your memory isn’t cooperating. Are these lapses happening all the time, or are they more frequent at certain times of the day, or when you’re particularly stressed or tired?
PATIENT: Hmm…that is a good question. I believe…more when I am tired, yes. And…when I am busy. If I am trying to do many things at once, the names…or what I was doing…it goes. When I am calm, and have time…it is better. Though not perfect.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, more noticeable with fatigue or when multitasking. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate, or any difficulty with problem-solving or making decisions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can still read, and I enjoy doing my work. I manage many properties, you see, and that requires…attention to detail. I can still balance the books, and speak with the tenants. It is not a…difficulty doing things, just…remembering where I put the pen, or what I told Mrs. Gable yesterday. It is very specific, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And you said this has been going on for about three to four months?
PATIENT: Yes. About that long. It started very slowly, as I said. I thought it was just…being older, perhaps. But now it is…more frequent. And I worry. My husband…he passed away two years ago. It feels like I should remember everything, to honor his memory. And this…this feels like I am losing something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara, and it’s completely natural to feel worried when you notice changes in your memory, especially after a loss like yours. We'll try to figure out what's going on. Before we proceed further, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I have…high blood pressure, as I mentioned. The other doctor…Dr. Volkov, he prescribed medication, but I do not take it regularly. I forget! Aside from that…I had pneumonia when I was younger, many years ago. And my knees…they bother me sometimes. Nothing else, really. I have not had any serious illnesses. I do not have insurance, so I avoid the doctor when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, pneumonia years ago, and some knee pain. You mentioned you don’t take the medication regularly because you forget. And no other significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. I am…very careful with my health, usually. I eat well, and I walk every day when the weather is nice. It is just…this memory. And the blood pressure, I suppose. It is a worry, Doctor. A real worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. No surgeries, eat well, walk regularly. That’s good. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Only vitamins. A multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my knees are bad, I take ibuprofen. But not often. Perhaps…once a week, or less. Nothing else. I do not like taking pills. I used to take something for my nerves, after my husband passed, but I stopped that a long time ago. It did not help much, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And you stopped taking something for your nerves some time ago. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I have eaten everything, traveled everywhere. I have never had a reaction to anything. I am quite robust, usually. But this…this memory issue, it concerns me. It is not like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother…she was forgetful in her later years, yes. But we thought it was just old age. She lived to be ninety-two, so she had a good long life. And…my uncle, on my father’s side, he was confused sometimes, towards the end. But I do not know what exactly was wrong with him. No one spoke of it much. It was…difficult times. They did not have doctors like you back then.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some memory issues in your mother and uncle, but no specific diagnoses. Thank you, Ms. Alvara. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Anything you think will help. I want to understand what is happening. I am…ready. Please, do what you need to do. I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Blood pressure is 158/92. That is elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiration is 16, normal. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Coordination is intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits. I'm going to check your gait next. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is sometimes difficult, my knees, you see. There. Is that alright? I try to walk straight, but it is…not always easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Your gait is a bit slow and cautious, likely due to your knees. No significant imbalance. Cranial nerves are intact. Okay, Ms. Alvara. That's a quick overview. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, your blood pressure is elevated, and you are experiencing some memory lapses that seem to be worse with fatigue and multitasking. You do not have any significant neurological findings. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. I also suggest we repeat your blood pressure readings over a few days to see if we can get a more accurate assessment. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…sensible. Blood tests, and checking the blood pressure again. I am willing to do whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is happening. Is it possible it is just…my age? Or the stress, perhaps? I worry so much. It is…hard to be alone.
DOCTOR: It is certainly possible that your symptoms are related to age or stress, Ms. Alvara, and those are important factors to consider. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes first. The blood tests will help us with that. We need to be thorough. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline. I'll also have the nurse take your blood pressure a few times over the next week, and we'll review the results together. Because you don't have insurance, the lab may offer a discount or a payment plan. I will have the nurse provide you with information on that. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds…very good, Doctor. Blood tests, checking the blood pressure, and information about the cost. Thank you for taking the time, Doctor. And for listening. It helps to…talk about it. It is…a burden, this worry. I just want to be able to…remember. To live my life.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I understand your concerns, and I'm here to help in any way I can. It’s important to address these worries, and we’ll work through this together. While we await the blood test results, I recommend trying to manage your stress levels. Gentle exercise, like walking, can be very helpful, and ensure you are getting enough sleep. Also, keeping a daily planner or using a notepad to jot down important information might help with the memory lapses. I’ll also have the nurse provide you with some information about local support groups. It might be helpful to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think…I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. I will try to manage the stress, and I will try the planner. Perhaps…perhaps knowing there is a plan helps. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. I will see you when the results are ready.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to review the results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Ms. Alvara.
