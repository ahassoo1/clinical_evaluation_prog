DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… honestly, a bit hard to explain. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about just… slowing down. A friend mentioned mindfulness, and then meditation, and it sounded… peaceful. I work with the trains, you see – signals and switches – and it can be quite stressful, keeping everything running on time and safe. I thought maybe learning to be a bit more… centered would help. I'm Liza, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're seeking… guidance on stress management techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Guidance is a good word. I wouldn't even know where to begin with it on my own. I’ve tried a few things, little bits and pieces I’ve read online, but nothing really… stuck. It all feels a bit… scattered. I was hoping you might have some suggestions, or know someone who does?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, this isn’t quite the typical reason people come to see a family physician. I’m trained to address medical concerns, not… lifestyle adjustments. However… I suppose chronic stress can manifest physically. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms – headaches, difficulty sleeping, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. Now that you mention it… the headaches are fairly regular, mostly tension headaches, right across my forehead. And sleep… well, I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I wake up a lot during the night. I think I toss and turn a bit, mostly just… thinking. It’s not terrible, but I'm always a bit tired, especially during the work week. I hadn't really connected it to the stress, to be honest. I just thought it was… getting older.
DOCTOR: I see. Headaches and disrupted sleep. Alright. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… probably the last six months, maybe a little longer. It’s been gradual, not like it came on suddenly. The headaches started as just once a week, then it became two or three times, and the sleep… it’s been getting worse slowly, too. It’s definitely noticeable now, I feel it when I’m at work, and it’s hard to focus sometimes. I remember things perfectly, thankfully – I have to remember things with the trains – but just… staying alert is harder.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking anything for these headaches?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t taken anything. I usually just… try to ignore them, or have a strong cup of tea. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. My mother always said to let things ride if they aren’t too bad, and I’ve always been like that, I suppose. I'm not allergic to anything that I know of, either. Is that… bad? That I haven't been taking anything?
DOCTOR: It’s not inherently bad, Ms. Sugino, but ignoring pain isn’t always the best course of action. It can sometimes indicate something more serious. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, but that was it. And a broken wrist when I was a child, but it healed fine. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I eat okay, I try to get some exercise when I can, though work keeps me pretty busy. My doctor back in Bulgaria used to do regular check-ups, of course, but that was a long time ago. I had a flu shot last winter, does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay. Cholecystectomy fifteen years ago, broken wrist as a child, and a flu shot last winter. And you said you haven’t been seeing a regular physician since leaving Bulgaria?
PATIENT: That’s right. It’s been… well, quite a while. I moved here about eight years ago, and I’ve just been… putting it off, I suppose. I feel fine, mostly, and I didn’t want to bother anyone. Plus, it’s always been hard finding a doctor who speaks my language fluently, so I just didn’t bother. I do worry about the headaches, though, and the sleep. And now… maybe it's time I look into this mindfulness thing a little more seriously. It’s just… where do you even start?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, before we delve into mindfulness techniques, Ms. Sugino, I think it’s prudent to rule out any underlying medical causes for your headaches and sleep disturbances. I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam, just to check your vital signs and neurological function. Then, I think some blood work is in order. It's a standard panel to check your thyroid, blood count, and vitamin levels. It will give us a baseline to work from. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible, actually. I'm glad you're suggesting that. I’d feel much better knowing there isn’t something… serious going on. Blood work is fine, and the exam too. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat and relax your arm. 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, please. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal bilaterally. I'll also check your cranial nerves… follow my finger with your eyes… Cranial nerves are intact. No obvious neurological deficits at this time. Everything appears within normal limits, but as I said, the blood work is essential. I’ll have the nurse draw those samples now.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I'm glad everything seemed okay, even if it was just a quick look. I’m happy to get the blood work done. And thank you for explaining everything as you went along, Doctor. It makes me feel much less worried. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work.
DOCTOR: Fasting for 12 hours is preferable, so no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is fine. And try to avoid strenuous exercise tomorrow morning. The nurse will give you specific instructions. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and then, if everything is medically clear, we can discuss strategies for stress management. Perhaps a referral to a therapist specializing in mindfulness techniques would be beneficial. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Let's get the blood work done first. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Fast after midnight, no strenuous exercise, and we'll talk about the results when they come back. A therapist specializing in mindfulness… that sounds lovely, actually. I hadn’t even thought of that. I think… I think I’m okay for now. Just a little anxious to get the results, but I understand that takes time. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go find the nurse.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse is just down the hall. We'll be in touch with the results as soon as they’re available. .
