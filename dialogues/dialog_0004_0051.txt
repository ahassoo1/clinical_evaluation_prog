DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. It's about my blood, I think. My son, he... well, he said I should find out what kind it is. Something about needing to know, just in case. I don’t quite remember all the details, you see. It's been a long time since I thought about any of this.
DOCTOR: Your blood type, you say. And your son suggested you come in to have that determined…just in case?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. He's a good boy, always looking out for me. I think it was after… after a little fall I had. Not a bad one, thankfully, but he got a bit worried. He mentioned something about hospitals and needing to know. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Do you need a name, his name? I can probably recall it if I… think hard.
DOCTOR: Knowing his name isn't critical at the moment, Ms. Nini. We can always get that later if needed. More important is understanding why he’s concerned about your blood type now, after a fall. Was there any injury to your head?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no head injury, Doctor. Not at all. I just… stumbled, that's all. Tripped over the rug, silly thing. Bruised my hip a bit, but that healed up quickly. He just got… fixated on this blood type thing after that. Said it was important for… emergencies. He's a bit of a worrier, that one. Always has been. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry, though. Is it a difficult thing to find out?
DOCTOR: It’s a simple blood test, Ms. Nini. Not difficult at all. However, your son’s concern is…unusual. Knowing your blood type is helpful in certain medical situations, certainly – transfusions, for example – but to focus on it after a simple fall…It does raise questions. To clarify, has anything else changed since the fall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… let me think. Nothing comes to mind immediately. I've been feeling… about the same, I suppose. A little tired sometimes, but that's just old age creeping up on me, I expect. No dizziness, no headaches… just a bit forgetful, as always. You know how it is at my age. Honestly, Doctor, I think he just got it into his head and started reading things on the internet. He does that a lot. Worrying and reading on the internet. It's a terrible combination!
DOCTOR: The internet can be… a source of misinformation, yes. Alright, Ms. Nini. Let's proceed with the blood test to appease your son, but I'd also like to do a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a broader picture of your overall health and rule out anything else contributing to your fatigue. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, a basic… what did you call it? A metabolic panel? Well, if you think it's best, Doctor, I suppose so. I trust your judgement. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking and prodding! I'm not a fan of needles, you see. But if it will put my son's mind at ease… and make sure I'm not falling apart completely, then yes. Do what you think is best. And thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood draw is fairly quick, and the metabolic panel is standard procedure. We'll need a small sample for each. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up. While we’re waiting, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. Not that I'm aware of, dear. Never had a problem with any medications. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but that was a long time ago. I don't take anything regularly now. Except for a little chamomile tea before bed, but I hardly think that counts! And… I think I had a bit of a reaction to a bee sting when I was a child, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. It just itched a lot. Mostly, I’ve been quite healthy, all my life, really. Knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… quite a while back. And I had a bit of pneumonia once, but that was nothing a good rest and some antibiotics couldn't fix. And… let me think… Oh! I had my hip replaced about ten years ago. That's why I tripped over the rug, actually. Still getting used to it, I suppose. It doesn’t bother me much, but sometimes it feels a bit stiff. Apart from that, I’ve been remarkably fortunate, I think. Mostly just the aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: And family history, Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he lived a long life, but I don't recall any specific illnesses. He was a very stoic man, didn't talk much about his health. And my brother… he had something with his heart, but again, it was a long time ago and I don't remember the details. We weren't very close, you see. It’s a bit of a blurry picture, I’m afraid. I wish I knew more, but that’s just how it is. It’s been a long time, and memories fade, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he smoked a little, but I always made him smoke outside. Terrible habit, if you ask me. And I certainly don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's about it. Mostly, I just enjoy a quiet life. A bit of gardening, reading… and visiting with my son and grandchildren whenever I can.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs and examine your abdomen. Then we'll get the nurse in to draw the blood. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. Just try not to poke too much! Proceed whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, with mild tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, likely secondary to prior hip replacement. No rebound or guarding. Alright, Ms. Nini. Everything seems within normal limits, but we’ll have the blood work done to confirm. I’ll have the nurse come in now to get started. Do you have a preference for which arm she uses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don't think it matters, dear. Whichever is easiest for her, really. I'm right-handed, if that makes a difference, but honestly, I'm not fussy. Just… be quick about it, if you could? My veins aren't what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll let the nurse know. Please remain seated. She will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Thank you.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. Goodbye, dear. .
