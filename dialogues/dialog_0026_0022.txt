DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. That’s it, I think. It just doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, your tummy feels big and you haven’t been very hungry lately. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… hard to say. Maybe a few weeks? Or was it longer? Everything feels like a long time ago these days, you know? It just… slowly got bigger, I think. And the eating… well, I used to enjoy my food so much. Now it just doesn’t taste the same.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It can be difficult to pinpoint things exactly. A few weeks, or longer… that gives us something to work with. And you’re saying your appetite has decreased, and food doesn’t taste as good as it used to?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not as good. Everything tastes… bland. Like… water. And I get full very quickly, even if I don't eat much. It’s strange. I used to be able to eat a good plate of potatoes and cabbage, but now… just a little bit makes me feel stuffed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased appetite, a change in taste – things tasting bland – and feeling full quickly, even with small portions. Have you noticed any other changes, Soila?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! Sometimes my legs feel a little… swollen, especially in the evenings. Not terrible, but… puffy. And I… I go to the bathroom more often, I think. But maybe I always have. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your legs, especially in the evenings, and increased frequency of urination. We’re gathering a lot of good information here. Now, have you experienced any pain anywhere – in your tummy, your back, anywhere at all?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Not a sharp pain, no. Sometimes my tummy feels a little… uncomfortable. Like it's full of air, maybe? But not pain. And my back… well, my back always aches a little, you know, being an old woman. I don't think that's new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no sharp pain, just some discomfort in your tummy, and the usual aches and pains in your back. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions? Let me see… I was a sociologist, you know. I studied people with conditions, I didn't have them! I think… I think I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor gave me some pills. But I stopped taking them. It was so long ago, I can't remember what for. And… I think I had something with my gallbladder once, but they took it out. A long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, and gallbladder removal. Do you remember when you had the gallbladder removed, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… that was… when my husband was still alive. No, wait, maybe after… Oh, it was a very long time ago. Sixty… seventy years ago, maybe? It was in a different country, a long way away. I came here later. Everything gets mixed up, you know? It was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. We don’t need an exact date. Sixty or seventy years ago is helpful. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, dear. Not any medications. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel… funny. I stopped the blood pressure pills a long, long time ago, like I said. Just… nothing. I try to eat good food, but it’s hard when it doesn’t taste good anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat a little bit of everything. Potatoes, cabbage, sometimes a little bit of meat… I never had any trouble with food. Maybe a little bit of gas sometimes, but that's just old age, I think. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your tummy. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That's alright. Do what you need to do. I trust you. My tummy does feel funny, so maybe you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s just… uncomfortable. But I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me, Soila. Heart sounds are… a little distant, but regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your tummy. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Hmmm… your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some fullness in the lower abdomen. No sharp pain with palpation, but you do seem to have some tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little bit there. Just a little bit. It’s not a sharp pain, like I said. Just… uncomfortable. It feels… full. Like I ate too much, but I didn't eat much at all. And… it feels a little bit hard, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some fullness and slight firmness in the lower abdomen. It doesn't feel like anything acutely painful, but it's definitely something we need to investigate further. Bowel sounds are present, but a little quiet. So, Soila, based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you’re experiencing some abdominal fullness, decreased appetite, and a change in taste. The quiet bowel sounds and slight firmness in your abdomen are also of note. It's difficult to say exactly what's going on without further testing. It could be a number of things, but given your age and symptoms, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. And I’d also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your organs and see what's causing the fullness. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests? Ultrasound? It sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust you. I just want to feel better. My tummy is uncomfortable, and I don’t enjoy my food anymore. So… yes. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and… an ultrasound. Just… please don’t make it too long. I’m an old woman, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll start with the blood tests, which can be done right here at the clinic. The ultrasound will require a separate appointment, but we can schedule it for as soon as possible. The blood tests will check things like your blood count, kidney and liver function, and electrolyte levels. These will give us a good overview of your overall health. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize your organs and see if there are any abnormalities. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood tests now. You can take that to the lab just down the hall, and they’ll draw the samples. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule the ultrasound and discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Blood tests first, then… the ultrasound. Just… tell me, Doctor, do you think it’s something serious? I’ve lived a long life, you know. I don’t want to… worry my friends too much.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Soila, and I understand your concern. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s something serious. Many things can cause abdominal fullness and decreased appetite, and it’s important not to jump to conclusions. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. It's good to be prepared, of course, but I don’t want to cause you unnecessary worry. Let’s focus on getting the tests done and then we can discuss the results and what they mean. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll write the lab order now, and the nurse will come in shortly to review the instructions with you. Do you have any questions for me before I do that?
PATIENT: No, dear. I don’t think so. Just… thank you. You’re very kind. I trust you to take care of me. And… please don’t make me wait too long for the results. It’s just… unsettling, you know, not knowing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do my best to expedite the results. I'll personally follow up with the lab to ensure they are processed quickly. The nurse will be in shortly with the instructions for the blood tests. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on taking care of yourself. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, fever, or vomiting, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Soila. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
