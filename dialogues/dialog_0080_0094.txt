DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. My husband... he say I need to come. For... talking? I work with metal. Lots of noise. I think he worry about my ears. I don't really remember why else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband is concerned about your ears because of your work with metal and the noise exposure. That's very thoughtful of him. And it’s good you’re here to get things checked out. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about what kind of metal work you do?
PATIENT: Sheet metal. You know, for... buildings? And... stuff. I cut it, bend it, put it together. Loud machines. Very loud. I wear… some things in my ears. But maybe not enough? I don't know. It's work.
DOCTOR: Okay, sheet metal work for buildings – that is loud. And you wear hearing protection, which is good. Can you describe what kind of hearing protection you use?
PATIENT: Uh... the foam ones? You push them in your ears. Sometimes... sometimes I forget them. They're not very comfortable after a long time. And my husband buys them, so I just... use what he gets. I don't pick them out myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, foam earplugs, and sometimes you forget to wear them or they become uncomfortable after a while. That's helpful to know. Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your hearing lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Like... worse? I don't know. Everything sounds… normal to me. Maybe a little muffled sometimes, but that's just the machines, right? It's always noisy at work. Hard to tell what's normal anymore. My husband say I don't listen to him sometimes. But that's always been true.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're not sure if your hearing is actually worse, and it’s hard to tell with all the noise at work. And your husband has mentioned you sometimes don’t seem to hear him as well. Let's do a quick hearing test, just to get a baseline and see if there’s any measurable difference. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Test? Like... in my ears? I don't like things in my ears. Does it hurt? I have small ears, you know. Everything is always too big for me. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: It's a very simple test, Airam, and nothing will be in your ears. You'll just wear headphones, and listen for beeps. It doesn't hurt at all, I promise. We just want to see how well you hear different sounds. It will help us figure out if the noise at work is affecting your hearing. And since your husband is concerned, it’s good to have a clear picture. It takes about ten minutes, and it could help us protect your hearing for the future. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ten minutes... okay. But if it's uncomfortable, I want to stop. And please be gentle. My ears are very sensitive. Is it a big machine? I don't like big machines near my head.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. It’s not a big machine at all – it’s just a pair of headphones. It's right over there. We'll sit you in a comfortable chair, put the headphones on, and I'll explain everything as we go. How about we start?
PATIENT: Okay... okay. Let's just get it over with. But promise you'll stop if I say so. And don't shout at me. I don't like loud noises, even if they're supposed to be tests.
DOCTOR: I promise, Airam. We’ll stop immediately if you ask, and I won’t shout. I'll explain everything beforehand, and we’ll go at your pace. Okay, so you'll sit comfortably, and I'll put these headphones on. I'm going to ask you to tell me when you hear a beep. It'll be very quiet at first, and then gradually louder. Just raise your hand when you hear something, anything at all. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright... quiet beeps... raise my hand... Okay. But if the beeps are too quiet, don't make me sit here all day. My time is valuable, you know. I have things to do. Just start it.
DOCTOR: Okay, here we go. Just relax and let me know when you hear a sound. Any sound at all?
PATIENT: ...Nothing. I don't hear anything. Are you sure this thing is working? My husband said I have good ears. He always says that. Maybe you need to turn it up louder. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little louder now. Any sound now?
PATIENT: ...Wait. Yes. I think... a very faint beep. Like a mosquito. But quiet. Very quiet. I almost didn't hear it. Is that right? Did I do it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect! You did it exactly right. That was very good. It means you can still hear that frequency, but it's very faint. Now let’s try another one. Just let me know if you hear anything, anything at all…
PATIENT: ...Nothing. Still nothing. Are you sure this machine is calibrated? I don't think it's working properly. Maybe I should just go home. I have dinner to make. My husband gets angry if dinner is late.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. It sounds like you’re getting frustrated, and that's perfectly understandable. Sometimes these tests can be difficult, and it’s not uncommon to have trouble hearing very quiet sounds. The machine is calibrated, but it’s possible the sounds are simply very faint, especially given the noise exposure at work. However, since you’re having trouble hearing anything, and you're concerned about the machine, let’s try something different. I can perform a quick tuning fork test, which is a simpler way to assess your hearing. It doesn't involve headphones, and it’s a quick way to see if there's any difference in how you perceive sound. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: A tuning fork? Is that like... for music? I don't want anything near my ears. I already told you, my ears are sensitive. But... fine. If it's quick. And you promise not to poke me with it. And don't shout at me while you're doing it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no poking, I promise. And I won't shout. It's very gentle. I'm going to gently tap this tuning fork, and then hold it near your ear. It will create a vibrating sound. Just tell me if you can hear it, and when you can no longer hear it. Okay, here we go. Just relax and let me know what you hear.
PATIENT: ...I... I feel a vibration. But I don't hear anything. Just a buzzing. Like a bee near my ear. Is that what I'm supposed to feel? It's making me nervous. Take it away. This is ridiculous. My husband is going to be so angry if I'm late for dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, no problem. We can stop there. You felt a vibration but didn't hear a distinct sound. Given the difficulties with the testing, your concerns about noise exposure, and your discomfort with the procedures, I’m concerned there may be some hearing loss. However, it's difficult to get a clear picture right now. I recommend a referral to an audiologist, who specializes in hearing tests and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. They have specialized equipment and can determine the extent of any hearing loss. Would you like me to write you a referral?
PATIENT: A... what? An audio-what? More tests? I don’t want more tests. I just want to go home and make dinner. My husband doesn’t like waiting. He gets… upset. Can’t you just tell me if my ears are okay? I need to know if I can keep working. If I lose my job, we'll be in trouble. Just tell me, yes or no. Are my ears okay?
DOCTOR: Airam, I understand your concerns about your job and your husband. And I wish I could give you a simple "yes" or "no" answer. However, it's not responsible for me to do that without a proper evaluation. The testing today was difficult, and we couldn’t get a clear result. An audiologist can perform more specific tests and give you an accurate assessment of your hearing. I can write you a referral to a local audiologist, and I can also provide information about low-cost hearing care options. They will be able to tell you if your hearing is affected and recommend appropriate measures, like hearing protection or other interventions. It's better to know for sure, so you can protect your hearing and continue working safely. Would you like me to write that referral for you?
PATIENT: …Fine. Just write the thing. But if it takes too long to get an appointment, I’m not going. And if they try to sell me expensive equipment, I’m leaving. I just need a quick answer. Are my ears okay enough to keep working, yes or no? If they can’t tell me that, it’s a waste of my time. My husband is going to be furious. Just write the paper. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m writing the referral now. I’m including a note requesting a quick assessment of your hearing levels. Here you go. The audiologist's name and contact information are on this paper. Please call and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, I strongly recommend wearing earplugs whenever you're working with loud machinery, even if they're not comfortable. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Just... this paper. I need to go home now. My husband is waiting. Thank you. I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're very welcome, Airam. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you have a safe trip home, and I wish you all the best.
