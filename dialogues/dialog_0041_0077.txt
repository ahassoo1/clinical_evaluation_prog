DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. Good morning to you too. Bigger is the name. They sent me here... something about the mine? Old man told me to come get checked, said it was important. Don't feel nothing wrong, you understand. But he worried too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bigger, I see here you were referred by… let me see… Old Man Hemlock, at the mine. Right. That’s good of him to think of you. Even if you don't feel anything wrong, it's always wise to get things checked out. Just a routine visit, really. Now, you said you don't feel anything specific?
PATIENT: Routine, eh? Hemlock always liked fancy words. No, I don’t feel nothing. Been working that mine for… long time now. Dust, rocks, noise… always been that way. Never bothered me before. Why bother me now? You going to poke and prod me all day?
DOCTOR: No poking and prodding all day, I promise. Just a standard check-up to make sure everything's working as it should, especially with the years you've spent at the mine. We just want to be thorough. Now, just to clarify… you've never experienced any shortness of breath, coughing, or chest pain, even with the dust and work?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I work. You get tired, you rest. Coughing… sometimes dust gets in your throat, you clear it. Chest pain? When I fall down, maybe! Old man, falling down. Not from the mine, though. Just clumsy, you understand. Always been clumsy. You askin' about falling down? I don't fall down at the mine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Bigger. So, no ongoing shortness of breath or chest pain. Just occasional dust irritation and… the occasional fall, not related to the mine. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels? What kinda question is that? I’m old! Old men get tired. Always tired. Always have been. Used to have more energy, I suppose, when I was a young man... but that was a long, long time ago. You think I’m gonna run a race now? Don’t be foolish. I work 'til I can't, then I rest. That’s it. What you tryin' to find?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. You’re right, energy levels change with age. I'm just trying to get a full picture. Have you noticed any new fatigue, anything more than usual tiredness after a day of work?
PATIENT: New fatigue? Hmm. Let me think… Work's been harder lately, that's true. Not the work itself, but… getting to the work. Old bones, you understand. Getting up in the morning is… harder now. Takes longer to get going. Is that what you mean? New? Yes. Bones are new at being old. Don't know if that's what you're askin'.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, increased difficulty getting started in the mornings, a bit more than usual. Anything else you've noticed?
PATIENT: Anything else… Let me see. Old Man Hemlock keeps lookin' at me funny. Like I'm gonna break somethin'. He keeps askin' if I’m sleepin’ alright. Sleepin’ alright? What's that got to do with anything? I sleep when I’m tired! Used to dream more, I suppose… But now… mostly just… quiet. Is that something you need to know? If I’m quiet at night? You askin' if I'm a noisy sleeper? I’m not a noisy sleeper!
DOCTOR: No, not whether you’re noisy. Just whether your sleep has changed recently. You mentioned you used to dream more, but now it’s mostly quiet. Has anything else changed— appetite, weight, bowel habits, things like that?
PATIENT: Appetite… No. I still eat. Maybe not as much rice as I used to, but I still eat. Weight… probably lost some weight. Old man shrinking, you understand. Bowel… what you call ‘em… habits? They’re… regular enough. Sometimes a little… slow. Old bones, slow everything. Why you askin’ so many questions about my insides? You a witch doctor?
DOCTOR: No, no witch doctor, Mr. Bigger. Just trying to get a complete picture of your health. It's important to know all these things, even the small changes, especially given your work history. Okay, so appetite is roughly the same, some weight loss, and bowel habits are a little slow. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses, like pneumonia or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… Hmm. When I was a young boy, I had a fever. Very bad fever. Almost died, they said. But I didn’t die. After that… nothin’ much. Maybe a cold here and there. Nothing serious. Pneumonia… tuberculosis… fancy words. Never had those. Hemlock tryin’ to scare me with those fancy words? Is that it? He always liked to show off his learnin’.
DOCTOR: I don't think Old Man Hemlock is trying to scare you, Mr. Bigger. It's just important to ask about past illnesses. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, even for a short time?
PATIENT: Hospital… No. Never been in a hospital. Always been strong enough to stay away from those places. Bad smell, they say. And full of sick people. No, I stayed away. Took some medicines from the village doctor when I was a boy, but never a hospital. Always been too busy workin’. Never had time for hospitals. You start askin' about my childhood now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem silly, Mr. Bigger. It's just important to have a complete picture of your health. One last question about your past health, if you don't mind. Have any close family members—parents, siblings—had serious illnesses like heart problems, cancer, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. That was a long time ago. My father… he worked the land. Died old. Quiet like. My mother… she made good food. Died after my father. Quiet like her too. Siblings… had a brother. He went to the city. Never heard from him again. No, don't remember any sicknesses in the family. Just… quiet dying. Always quiet dying. What good is askin' about dead people? Makes no sense. You done now? Can I go home? I’m gettin’ tired of talkin’ about insides and dead people.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bigger, I think I have enough information for now. You’ve been very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and look at your general condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… Hmph. Fine. Poke and prod away, I suppose. But don't expect much. Old bones, you understand. Not much to find. But if you find somethin', you tell me straight. No fancy words. Just tell me what it is. And be quick about it. I have things to do. Quiet things, mostly. Now get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. If you could just sit here on the table for me, we'll get started. It won't take long. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay. I’m hearing some slight crackling in your lungs. This could be from a number of things, and doesn't necessarily mean anything serious at this point, but we'll want to investigate further. Now, I’ll just check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Let’s just quickly take your temperature and pulse… Temperature is normal, pulse is a little fast, but within the normal range. Now, I'll just take a look in your ears and throat… Ears look clear, throat looks a little dry.
PATIENT: Dry throat… That's from the dust, I tell ya. Always dry throat from the dust. You askin’ me somethin’? What you findin’? Don't tell me fancy words, just tell me if I’m gonna die. Is that what you’re lookin’ for? If I’m gonna die? Because I’ve lived a long life. A quiet life. And I’m ready to go when I’m ready. But don’t tell me it's the dust. I know it’s the dust. Everyone knows it’s the dust. Now get on with it. This is takin' too long. Quiet things waitin' for me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I'm not saying you're going to die. I'm just noting the findings from the exam. Your lungs have some crackling, which could be from the dust, as you say, but it's something we need to look into further to be sure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your throat is dry, which could also be from the dust. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… Blood work… Fancy. More pokin' and proddin'. Hemlock sendin’ me on a wild goose chase. He always liked fancy tests. Waste of time and money. But… fine. Do your tests. Get it over with. But don’t expect much. Old bones won’t show you nothin’ good. And don't tell me it's the dust. I already know it's the dust. Just get it over with. Quiet things waitin’. Just… hurry. I'm gettin' tired of talkin’ about insides and tests. And dust. Always the dust.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I'll write you a requisition for the chest X-ray and blood work. You can take this to the lab and radiology department at the clinic. They'll schedule you for the tests. It should take about an hour, maybe a little longer. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Not anymore. You write down all your fancy tests. I get poked and prodded. Then I wait. Then I come back and you tell me somethin’ bad. That's how it always goes. Just… tell me when to come back. Don't make me wait too long. Quiet things waitin'. That’s all. And don't tell me it's the dust. Thank you, Doctor. Now if you’ll excuse me. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. The lab should call you within a day or two to schedule the tests. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And… I understand your concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Mr. Bigger. And… try to rest.
