DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our clinic. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Medicare is… right. It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest, why I’m exactly here. Something about my ears, and… feeling dizzy? My daughter helped me make the appointment. She said it’s been happening again, and… my husband, he used to get it too. It’s just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: “Comes and goes,” is rather vague, Ms. Mayhugh. Could you be more specific about these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… right. Well, it’s like… everything spins. Not like a fun spin, you know? A bad spin. And I can’t hear properly when it happens. Everything sounds… muffled. It usually lasts a few hours, maybe a bit longer. Then it just… stops. Like someone flipped a switch. I wish I could explain better, but it's hard to remember the details each time. It's been happening on and off for… years, I think. Before… before my husband passed.
DOCTOR: "Years," you say. And this has never been properly investigated?
PATIENT: Investigated…? Oh. I… I don’t know. Maybe? I saw a doctor years ago, a different one. He gave me some pills, I think. But it didn’t really fix anything, it just… helped with the sickness sometimes. I mostly just try to rest when it happens. Honestly, I don’t remember much about what he said or did. It was a long time ago, and… well, things have been a bit hazy since then. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's try to get a clearer picture now. I’m going to need you to be as precise as possible, Ms. Mayhugh. Do you experience any other symptoms during these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, like I'm going to be sick, but I rarely actually am. And… oh! Yes, sometimes I feel a fullness in my ear, like it’s blocked up. Like when you're on an airplane. It's… uncomfortable. I don't usually get a headache, no. And… nothing else really comes to mind. It’s mostly the spinning and the muffled hearing. Is that helpful? I'm sorry if I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: “Fullness in the ear,” is good to know. Now, have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers…? Oh, that’s a good question. No, not really. It seems to come out of nowhere. Sometimes I’m just sitting and reading, and then… wham. Other times I’m walking around, doing things. I don't think it's related to anything specific. Though, now that I think about it… maybe stress? When things get a bit hectic, it might be more likely to happen. But even then, it's not a guarantee. It's so unpredictable, really. My daughter thinks it's the loud music at the bingo hall… but I enjoy my bingo!
DOCTOR: Well, we can certainly explore potential triggers later. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical conditions… I have… well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that, every day. And… arthritis, I think. It makes my hands a bit sore sometimes. Other than that… not that I know of. I try to stay healthy, but I’m getting older, you know? Things start to ache and… well, you forget things. I'm sure there's probably something else, but it’s not coming to me right now. Would my daughter's doctor have a record of things? She helps me with a lot of this.
DOCTOR: We can certainly access those records with your permission, Ms. Mayhugh. But for now, let's focus on what you recall. Past surgical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Surgical history… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed, years and years ago. And… I think I had some work done on my eyes when I was younger, to fix my vision. But that was a very long time ago. Nothing else comes to mind, no. I try to avoid doctors when I can, you know? It’s not a pleasant experience. And things… well, they just slip my mind. I’m sorry. Is this making things difficult? I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: It is a bit challenging, Ms. Mayhugh. Family history then. Any significant medical conditions in your family – heart disease, stroke, hearing loss, neurological problems…?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Yes, well, my husband, he had this… this dizziness, just like me. That’s why I said it runs in the family. He went to lots of doctors, but they never really figured it out. And… my mother, she had some problems with her hearing later in life, I think. She got very quiet, and we had to shout a lot. My brother had a stroke a few years back, but he recovered mostly. Other than that… it’s a bit hazy, honestly. We didn't talk about medical things much, back then. It wasn’t something we did. Is that helpful? I wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s discuss your medications. You mentioned a pill for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… let me think. It’s a little white pill… it starts with an 'A', I think. Amlodipine? Yes, I believe that’s it. Amlodipine. And… the dosage? Oh dear. I have no idea. I just take one every morning with my breakfast. My daughter refills it for me, so I don’t have to worry about it. I’m sorry, I really wish I could be more helpful. Is there someone who could tell you? She's usually very good with these things.
DOCTOR: We can access that information, Ms. Mayhugh. Let's move on. Any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, not ever. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't been stung by a bee or anything. I'm not usually around anything that might cause an allergy, you see. I stay mostly indoors. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple person. I don’t think I have any allergies. Are you sure that’s important? I feel like we’re going in circles a bit. I just want to know what’s causing this dizziness.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Mayhugh. Now. I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination. We'll start with your ears, and then I’ll check your balance and neurological function. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical examination… yes, I suppose that’s a good idea. Please be gentle, doctor. My ears are… sensitive. And… I might get a little nervous. Just… let me know what you’re doing, okay? And… if anything feels particularly strange, I'll tell you. I trust you, doctor. Just… take your time. This dizziness is so worrying, and I just want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. I'm just looking in your right ear now. Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen – earwax – buildup. Not excessive, but it could be contributing to your symptoms. And the left ear… similar findings. Some cerumen buildup present. Now, I’m going to check your tympanic membranes – your eardrums. Okay. Both eardrums appear intact, but there’s reduced mobility on both sides. Now, I'm going to assess your balance. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Stand up… yes, I can do that. Careful now… my knees aren't what they used to be. Reduced mobility… is that bad, doctor? I do feel a bit unsteady sometimes, but I thought that was just old age. Just… tell me what you want me to do. I'm a little nervous, you see. This dizziness is making me feel anxious.
DOCTOR: Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Hmm. There’s a noticeable sway, even with support. And now, I'd like you to walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps. Okay. Stop there. There's a slight unsteadiness and a tendency to veer to the right. Now, please stand with your feet together, eyes closed, and keep your arms at your sides. Okay. Finally, I'll just check your basic neurological function. Follow my finger with your eyes – do not move your head. Good. Now, squeeze my hands… firmly. And now, can you feel this on your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Walking a straight line… it's harder than it looks. I'm trying, doctor, I really am. This dizziness is making it difficult. Following your finger… yes, I can do that. I think so… it's a bit blurry. Squeezing your hands… yes, I'm squeezing. It feels… a little numb, maybe? I'm not sure. My hands get cold easily. And feeling… what was it? Something on my arms? It feels… tingly? Like pins and needles, maybe? This is all a bit overwhelming, doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Based on the physical examination, your symptoms and your medical history, I suspect you may be experiencing a form of vestibular dysfunction, potentially exacerbated by cerumen impaction. The reduced mobility of your tympanic membranes and the findings from the balance tests support this suspicion. The tingling sensation you described could be related to mild nerve compression, but further investigation is needed to rule out other causes. I recommend we order a comprehensive audiological evaluation, including tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, and a videonystagmography – VNG – to assess your inner ear function. We’ll also need to rule out any other potential underlying causes, such as a possible vitamin deficiency or a neurological issue.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Vestibular dysfunction…? That sounds… complicated. And VNG…? Is that a test? A test sounds… frightening. A vitamin deficiency…? I do try to eat well, but my daughter does most of the grocery shopping. Is it serious, doctor? Are you saying something is wrong with my brain? I get so worried sometimes. My husband always said I worry too much. What does this all mean? Will I be okay? I just want to be able to enjoy my bingo again… and spend time with my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhugh, please, try to remain calm. "Vestibular dysfunction" simply means there's an issue with the inner ear system that controls balance. It's a relatively common condition, and it is often treatable. The VNG is a non-invasive test – it measures eye movements to assess your inner ear function. It won't hurt, and it provides valuable information. As for your concerns about other potential causes, it is standard practice to rule out all possibilities. I am not saying there is anything wrong with your brain, but we need to investigate further to ensure an accurate diagnosis. I am ordering a blood test to check your vitamin levels, including B12 and D. We’ll also schedule the audiological evaluation with our specialist as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’ll prescribe a medication to help with the symptoms of dizziness – Meclizine, 12.5mg, take one tablet every 8 hours as needed. I also recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can exacerbate your symptoms. And, importantly, please avoid any activities that might increase your risk of falling. I'll also give you a list of resources for managing dizziness and balance issues. We will review the results of these tests at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. It’s important to remember, Ms. Mayhugh, we are working together to get you feeling better. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Two weeks… that seems like a long time. Meclizine… another pill. I'm starting to feel like a pharmacy. Caffeine and alcohol… yes, I can do that. I don’t drink much alcohol anyway. And… avoiding falls… that’s a bit scary. I do enjoy my garden. Will this medication make me sleepy, doctor? I need to be alert for my grandchildren. And… what if the tests show something serious? What if it is something wrong with my brain? I'm just so worried. My husband always said I worried too much… but this dizziness is so frightening. Can you just tell me… will I be okay?
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhugh, I understand your concerns, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. The Meclizine can cause some drowsiness in some patients, but it’s usually mild. If you experience significant sedation, please stop taking it and contact my office. As for the tests, it’s important to remember that we are doing these tests to rule out serious conditions, not to confirm them. The vast majority of dizziness cases are caused by treatable inner ear problems. While I cannot guarantee a specific outcome, I can assure you that we will provide the best possible care and explore all available treatment options. I would also recommend exploring support groups for individuals with dizziness and balance issues. Connecting with others who understand what you’re going through can be incredibly helpful. I’m providing you with a list of local support groups, as well as a contact number for a therapist specializing in anxiety management. We'll review the test results together in two weeks, and we'll formulate a comprehensive treatment plan based on those findings. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other immediate questions?
PATIENT: Oh… support groups… that sounds… nice, I suppose. And a therapist… I don't know about a therapist. I've never been to a therapist. I just… I just want my life back. I want to be able to enjoy my bingo, and spend time with my grandchildren, without worrying about falling or getting dizzy. Will the tests take long? I have a bingo night next Friday… and I promised my granddaughter I'd take her to the park on Saturday. I don't want to miss those things. Thank you, doctor… for everything. I think… I think that's all for now. I just need to… process all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. The tests typically take about an hour, and we'll do our best to schedule them as quickly as possible to minimize any disruption to your plans. We will schedule them around your bingo night and park visit. Please remember that we are here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And Ms. Mayhugh, try to focus on the positive. We're taking the first steps towards getting you feeling better. We will see you in two weeks. .
