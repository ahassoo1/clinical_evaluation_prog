DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Josie, right?
PATIENT: Yes, Josie. Look, can we just get this over with? I have a very important meeting this afternoon and really don't have time to sit here all day. It's just… food keeps coming back up, you know? Horrible stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, "food keeps coming back up." Okay. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? What more specific do you need? I eat, and then it… comes back up. Is that not specific enough for you? Honestly, I'm a very busy man. Emergency Management doesn't run itself, you know. People rely on me.
DOCTOR: Emergency Management… right. Well, how is it coming back up, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Look, it's not a pleasant experience. It’s… well, it bubbles up. Sometimes it's just after I eat, sometimes a few hours later. It's like… a bad taste in my mouth, then whoosh. It’s just…regurgitation, alright? Is that what you medical people call it? Can we please just skip the details? It's embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Regurgitation, yes. And how often would you say this is happening, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think… probably three, maybe four times a week. Sometimes more if I have…a richer meal. Look, I eat good food, okay? I deserve good food. It's not like I'm eating junk. It's just… sometimes it doesn't stay down. What's the point of enjoying a good steak if it's going to end up… well, never mind. Just tell me what pill you're going to give me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "rich," what does that entail?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a grown man. I eat steak, sausages, pierogi… foods with flavor! Not… rabbit food, alright? I don't need to list every single thing I put in my mouth for you. It's… heavy food. Foods with sauces, you know? Things that taste good. This is ridiculous. I’m telling you what’s happening, what more do you need?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Let's just back up a bit. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this regurgitation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't have a fever or anything. I feel perfectly fine, except for the, you know… the incident. My wife keeps complaining about my heartburn, but I've always had a bit of heartburn. Comes with the territory, alright? Good food and a little heartburn. It's a fair trade. Don't tell me I need to change my diet.
DOCTOR: Your wife mentions heartburn… is it consistent, or does it come and go with the regurgitation?
PATIENT: She complains mostly after I eat a good meal. You know, something substantial. It's not constant, thankfully. I just pop a little something she gives me, and it usually goes away. She's very good at that sort of thing. It's just… this regurgitation is new. Or, well, it's worse than usual. She says I'm getting old, but I feel fine! I just… want this fixed. What are you going to do about it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? I'm still the Director of Emergency Management! My routine hasn't changed. Work is work. We had a small flood last month, but that’s normal for this time of year. We handled it. No, nothing has changed. Except for this… unpleasantness. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. Running a whole county isn’t easy, you know. But I don’t need a lecture about my stress levels. I need a solution. Now, are you going to give me something or what?
DOCTOR: Let's just take a listen to your abdomen, alright?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't like being poked and prodded. I have a very important meeting, remember? And frankly, I'm a perfectly healthy man. This is probably just indigestion. Can't you just give me something for indigestion? This whole thing is a waste of my time. I'm sure I could have self-diagnosed this better. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. There's some tenderness here… and your weight is… concerning. Do you have any idea how much you've weighed in the past?
PATIENT: Concerning? I'm a broad man! I've always been… substantial. My weight has fluctuated, alright? When I'm stressed, I eat more. When things are calm, I… don't eat as much. But it's never been a problem! I'm strong as an ox, I tell you! I can lift heavy things, I walk long distances… I’m perfectly capable! And frankly, I resent you commenting on my weight. It's rude, and it has nothing to do with my… regurgitation. Just give me the pill! I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. I'm going to order some blood work, just to rule things out. And I’d like to schedule you for an endoscopy. It’s the best way to see what’s going on. No, it’s not just indigestion. I want to know the cause of this, and until we do, I won’t be prescribing anything. We need to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An endoscopy?! Are you serious?! Look, I am a busy man. I do not have time for procedures! I'm not sticking a camera down my throat! Blood work, fine, I’ll grudgingly allow that. But no endoscopy! Absolutely not! I’m telling you, it’s stress. Give me something for stress and I'll be on my way. I have people relying on me! And frankly, I think you’re overreacting. I'm perfectly capable of handling this myself. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand you're busy, but dismissing potential serious issues is irresponsible. I will order the blood work. However, I strongly recommend reconsidering the endoscopy. It’s the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. Without it, I cannot prescribe anything safely. Please, at least think about it. I’m not trying to waste your time; I'm trying to ensure your health. Here’s a requisition for the blood work.
