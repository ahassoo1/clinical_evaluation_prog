DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. An… unpleasantness, down there. A discharge, if you must know. Not a pleasant situation for a man of my age, I assure you. It’s been… a little while now. Though, exactly how long… escapes me. Things aren't as sharp as they used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Krok. It's not easy talking about these things, and it's very common. Don't feel embarrassed at all. “A little while now…” – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Perhaps… a month? Maybe two? It’s difficult to say. My wife, bless her heart, noticed it first, and she’s the practical one. She urged me to come. I haven't been feeling ill, per se. No fever, no pain… just this… dampness. It's rather bothersome when one is trying to maintain a certain… dignity, you see. It's not something a gentleman discusses easily.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing this with me, Mr. Krok. No fever or pain, that's good to know. And it sounds like it's primarily a bothersome symptom at this point. Has the amount of discharge changed at all over the past month or two?
PATIENT: Changed… yes, I believe it has. At first, it was… minimal. Barely noticeable. Now… well, it requires a… a change of undergarments more frequently. A most undignified situation, I assure you. My wife says it’s also… different in appearance. I haven’t paid that much attention, naturally. I leave the particulars to her. She’s a very observant woman, and a practical one. Though, truthfully, I suspect she just wants me to get it sorted so she doesn't have to keep doing the laundry. A woman’s work, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's gradually increased in amount and perhaps changed in character. Okay. And has there been any change in your urinary habits – any burning, urgency, or frequency?
PATIENT: Urinary habits… no, no changes there. Perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t experienced any… discomfort. Perhaps a little slower in the mornings, as one gets older, but nothing of consequence. I wouldn’t say it’s… painful, or burning, or anything of that sort. Frankly, Doctor, I just want to get this… issue resolved. It’s a nuisance, and it’s hardly befitting a man of my standing. Do you think it’s… serious? I haven't been with anyone... if you are implying anything of that sort. My wife would be most displeased.
DOCTOR: I certainly wasn’t implying anything, Mr. Krok. I simply need to gather as much information as possible. It's good to know there's no pain or changes in urination. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Well. I suppose it’s necessary, if you believe it’s required. I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of such examinations. A man of my age has… sensitivities, you understand. But if it will expedite matters and provide a definitive answer, then I suppose I have no choice. Though I do hope it can be done… discreetly. And quickly. I have a garden to tend, you know. Tomatoes don't prune themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything as we go. I will need you to lie down on the examination table, and I'll use a sterile instrument to take a small sample for testing. It might cause a slight discomfort but shouldn’t be painful. And it’s all quite routine. If you're ready, we can proceed. I’ll step out of the room while you get situated, and then I’ll return when you are comfortable.
PATIENT: Very well. A most… unpleasant necessity. But if it means a swift return to my tomatoes, then I suppose I must endure. A small sample, you say? I trust it won't take long. And do ensure everything is… sterile. I wouldn’t want any complications. Just… give me a moment. And please, be quick about it. I have a schedule to maintain, you know. Tomatoes, Doctor. Tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, are you ready when I return?
PATIENT: As ready as I’ll ever be, Doctor. Do hurry, please. This is… undignified. Just get it over with. And try not to… poke too much. Tomatoes, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm just going to gently examine the area. I’ll be using lubricant to make it more comfortable. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. Okay, that’s all done. Just a small sample for the lab. I didn’t see anything immediately concerning, but the lab results will give us a more definitive answer. There’s some mild redness, which could indicate some inflammation. Now, let’s get you dressed. We'll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. I'll call you as soon as I have them. While we wait, it’s best to practice good hygiene in the area.
PATIENT: Good hygiene… yes, of course. My wife is quite particular about such things. So, you saw… something? Is it serious, Doctor? Will I require… medication? I really must get back to my tomatoes. They’re rather sensitive, you know. A slight blight is threatening the San Marzanos. It's a most stressful situation. And this… this whole ordeal… has not improved my temperament. Will it affect my gardening? I simply must know. Tomatoes, Doctor. Tell me about the tomatoes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok, and I’ll do my best to address them. Based on the preliminary examination, I suspect it may be a common infection, likely bacterial in nature. It’s usually easily treated with antibiotics. However, we need the lab results to confirm the specific type of bacteria so we can choose the most effective medication. As for your tomatoes, I don’t foresee this affecting your gardening at all. The treatment is usually oral, and side effects are minimal. You shouldn't experience anything that would prevent you from tending to your plants. While we wait for the results, it’s important to avoid sexual activity to prevent spreading the infection. And as I mentioned, practice good hygiene in the area. Once we have the results, I’ll prescribe the appropriate medication, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure the treatment is working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: No effect on the tomatoes… that is… reassuring. Very reassuring. Avoiding… activities… yes, of course. My wife would be most pleased to hear that. She's always urging me to take things easy. And she's quite adept at monitoring my… wellbeing. So, antibiotics, you say? Oral medication… good. As long as I can continue with my gardening, then I suppose I can endure a few pills. A small price to pay for a bountiful harvest. When can I expect these results? And… will they require a follow-up visit? I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. Tomatoes, Doctor. Always tomatoes.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 2-3 business days, so I anticipate having them by the end of the week. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. We will need a follow-up appointment to ensure the treatment is effective and the infection has cleared. We can schedule that for a week or so after you start the antibiotics. If you experience any worsening symptoms—increased pain, fever, or unusual discharge—please call the clinic immediately. Here is some information on maintaining good hygiene. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I understand your busy schedule, Mr. Krok, and we’ll do our best to accommodate your needs. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Very good. Good hygiene… yes, I suppose that’s sensible. And the card… useful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… efficiency. And your understanding of my… commitments. No, I believe that is all. Unless… do you happen to have any recommendations for blight prevention? The San Marzanos are particularly susceptible, you see. It’s a most vexing problem. But if not… then no. That will be all. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, do call with those results as soon as possible. Tomatoes, you understand. They are relying on me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. For blight prevention, I recommend a copper-based fungicide. You can find it at most gardening supply stores. And ensuring good air circulation around the plants can also help. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Take care of yourself, Mr. Krok, and enjoy your tomatoes. .
