DOCTOR: Alright, Mande Haggag, 51 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Batara. It's... it's a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I'm kind of yellow. Not a nice color, you know? It started a few days ago, and I think it might have something to do with the fava beans I ate. I had a big plate of them at a friend’s house, and then... this started.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, fava beans. I haven’t eaten them in years, actually. I used to love them when I was a little girl, growing up in Romania, but my grandmother always warned me they could cause trouble. I didn't think much of it then, and I certainly didn’t connect it to this until I remembered her saying something about them and feeling sick. Is that… is that a thing? I don’t even know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It can be a thing. There's a genetic condition—it's relatively rare, but more common in people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent—called G6PD deficiency. It means your body doesn't have enough of an enzyme to properly process certain things, and fava beans can trigger a reaction. Though, to be clear, it's not just fava beans. Let's not jump to conclusions. How long ago did you eat these fava beans, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds complicated. I'm not very good with medical things, I'm afraid. Just knowing there’s a name for it already makes me feel a little better, though. Let me think… I had them on Saturday. So, three days ago, I guess? It wasn't a huge amount, but definitely a full plate. It was a barbecue, and my friend made a big bean salad. I enjoyed it, and then Sunday I started feeling a bit weak, and yesterday… well, yesterday I noticed the color change. I thought I was just tired at first, but then my husband pointed it out, and I got worried. He's usually pretty good at noticing things like that.
DOCTOR: Three days ago. Alright. And you said weakness… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s not like a muscle weakness, exactly. More… just completely drained. Like I haven't slept in days, even though I have. I just don't have any energy. Getting out of bed is hard. Even talking feels tiring, if that makes sense. And… I've been a little bit dizzy, too. Not all the time, just sometimes when I stand up quickly. I haven’t been able to do my normal chores around the house, and that’s not like me at all. I usually like to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Dizziness… and fatigue. I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t had a fever, and no stomach problems, thankfully. No nausea or anything like that. My urine… it seems a bit darker than usual, now that you mention it. Almost… tea-colored? I didn’t really pay much attention until just now, thinking about symptoms. And my heart feels like it's beating a bit faster sometimes, but I don’t know if that’s just me being anxious. Everything feels strange, honestly. I'm usually very healthy, so this is quite worrying.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and a racing heart… Yes, those are… pertinent details. Alright. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a liver panel, and a bilirubin level. We’ll also check your kidney function and run a urine analysis. And, just to be thorough, we will do a G6PD deficiency test. Now, I'm going to need a bit more information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, tests already. Okay. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that, Dr. Batara. Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past, not that I can remember. I’ve only ever really taken antibiotics a couple of times for bad colds, and I didn't have any problems with those. I have a slight sensitivity to penicillin, but it’s not a full-blown allergy, more like a mild rash. My doctor always makes a note of it, just in case. Other than that, no. I don’t take any regular medication.
DOCTOR: Mild rash with penicillin. Noted. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No major illnesses, thankfully. Just the usual childhood things, like chickenpox and measles. Nothing serious. And I had my appendix out when I was 17, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered just fine. Everything was normal after that. I’ve been generally very healthy since then, until now, of course. I’ve always tried to eat a good diet and get plenty of exercise. I’m a bit worried that this is something… serious. Is it possible it’s not the fava beans?
DOCTOR: It could be something else, yes. But given your history – the fava beans, the timing, the symptoms – it’s a reasonable starting point. We need to rule things out. Now, let’s talk about family history. Does anyone in your family have anemia, or any blood disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she was always… frail. She was very thin and tired a lot, even when I was a little girl. My mother always said she had “weak blood,” but they didn’t really have good doctors in her village back then, so they never really figured out what was wrong. No one else, as far as I know. My father’s side of the family was very healthy, mostly farmers. They worked hard, but they were strong and didn’t get sick often. I never heard of anyone having problems with their blood. Would that “weak blood” count as anemia? It was a long time ago, and I was just a child.
DOCTOR: “Weak blood” is… vague. But the fatigue is suggestive. Alright. We’ll need to run the tests to get a definitive answer. Now, I need to do a quick physical exam. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A quick exam sounds good. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Here we go. I hope I haven't had too much coffee this morning. It doesn't help with the racing heart, you know?
DOCTOR: Your weight is 132 pounds, height 178 centimeters. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I detect a slight yellowing of the sclera—the whites of your eyes—which correlates with your reported symptoms. Your heart rate is elevated at 92 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Lung sounds are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you extend your arms, please?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. I hope everything is alright, Dr. Batara. I'm a little worried, to be honest. This is just so… unlike me. I usually feel very strong, very healthy. I've never had to worry about things like this before. The fava beans... it just seems so strange that something like that could cause all this trouble. I mean, it's just a bean, right? It's hard to believe it's causing this much of a reaction. But I trust your judgment, of course. You’re the doctor.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. Your skin feels warm and dry. Now, I'm going to draw some blood for the tests we discussed. The lab is just down the hall. It will take about 30 minutes to get the initial results, and we'll discuss them once they are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans – and any other potentially triggering foods – until we have a clearer diagnosis. It's likely G6PD deficiency, but we need to confirm it with the blood tests. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… sensible. Avoiding fava beans is probably a good idea. And waiting for the tests… I guess there’s not much else I can do. Thirty minutes, you said? I’ll just sit in the waiting room, then. Thank you, Dr. Batara. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and taking this so seriously. I’m just hoping it’s not anything too serious, and that I can get back to my normal life soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will show you to the waiting room. We'll call you when the results are ready. .
