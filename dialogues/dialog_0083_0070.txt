DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor… Alanes, yes? It’s… nice. I think. New doctor, new place. I just… moved here. From… somewhere. It’s all a bit much, you know? Medicare said I need to come. Social thing. Not sick, not really. Just… checking, I guess? Old age. That’s what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a lot adjusting to a new place, and new doctors. We appreciate you coming in for your wellness check, as Medicare recommends. Even if you’re not feeling particularly unwell, it's good to get a baseline assessment. So, let's start with a bit of your history. Could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: History? Oh, boy. That’s… a long story. I do makeup, you know? For the theater. Always have. Lots of late nights, lots of… faces. I’m not a patient patient, if you understand. I keep busy. Never much time for doctors before. Everything always… worked. Still works, mostly. What do you need to know exactly? It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We don't need the entire story, just enough to get a sense of things. Perhaps we can start with any major illnesses or surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Major… illnesses? Hmm. I had… something with my stomach, years ago. Very bad pain. They… cut it out, I think? Or maybe they just… looked inside? It was a long time ago, in… Russia. Everything is blurry. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder when I was hanging decorations. Theater, of course. Very dramatic fall. They put a cast on. But that's… all I really remember. Nothing else important, I don't think. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Is there a form I can fill out? I’m better with writing things down.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common to have trouble recalling details from the past, especially if it was a long time ago. We do have forms, but we can also just take it slowly. So, you mentioned stomach surgery in Russia and a broken wrist. Do you remember approximately when those happened?
PATIENT: When? Oh, dear. That is… a difficult question. The stomach thing… maybe twenty years ago? Or thirty? Before… before the divorce, definitely. The wrist… less than twenty years, I think. Maybe ten? Fifteen? Look, Doctor, I’m a makeup artist, not a historian! Everything blends together. Late nights, bright lights, lots of different faces. It all gets… mixed up. Is there anything quicker we can do? This is… stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Szmyd. We can definitely proceed without exact dates. It’s more important to get a general picture of your health history. Let's shift gears a bit. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… No, not really. I take… vitamins, sometimes. For the skin. You know, to keep it looking young. But nothing… serious. Just the usual. Sometimes a painkiller for my back, if I’ve been bending over a lot. But that's only… when needed. I try to avoid pills if I can. Too many chemicals, you know? Messes with the face. Is that what you want to know? About pills?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no. I'm Russian! We're tough. We eat everything, do everything. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes in the spring, but that's just… the air. Wait… I think I had a bad reaction to some face cream once. Very itchy. But that was years ago. And it wasn’t a real allergy, just… sensitive skin. Nothing serious. Really, Doctor, I’m a very healthy man. For my age. It’s all the makeup, you know. Keeps the skin… protected.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, boy. That’s a long story, Doctor. A very long story. My mother… she lived to be very old. Ninety, I think. But she was always… complaining. Everything hurt. My father… he worked in a factory. Very strong man. He died young, unfortunately. Something with his heart, I believe. Lots of smoking, you know. And my sister… she lives in… somewhere. I haven’t seen her in years. She has… problems. Lots of problems. Really, it's not a very interesting family history. Lots of sadness, lots of… complications. Nothing useful for you, I’m sure. Is there something else we can talk about? This is… depressing.
DOCTOR: I understand. We don't need to dwell on it if it's difficult to discuss. Let’s move on to your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Drink? Drugs? Doctor, are you questioning my character? I am a professional makeup artist! I need steady hands, a clear mind! I drink… a little wine with dinner, sometimes. Very good wine. For the… health. But smoking? Drugs? Never! Absolutely never! I am a Russian man, we drink responsibly! And… we appreciate good quality. It’s a matter of culture! Now, is that what you wanted to know? Am I a good man? Because I am a good man.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, you seem to be in very good spirits. And I assure you, I wasn't questioning your character at all. Just gathering information. Now, finally, do you have any current medical complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Hmm. Well… my back aches sometimes, like I said. From bending over faces all day. And my eyes are getting tired, I think. From the bright lights. And… I get a little breathless sometimes, when I climb stairs. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? Nothing serious. I can still work, still do makeup, still… function. I’m not a young man, Doctor. Things are going to… ache. It’s normal, isn’t it? Is that what you wanted to hear? That I’m old and achy? Because that’s the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam… Oh, boy. More poking and prodding? Must we? I’m a sensitive man, you know. But… alright. If you must. Get it over with quickly, please. I have… appointments. Important appointments. But be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And tell me if anything hurts. But honestly, everything probably will. I’m old, remember? Just… try to be quick, please. Very quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Your blood pressure is 142/88, your pulse is 78 and regular, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your breathing rate is 16 breaths per minute. That blood pressure is a little elevated, which we can discuss later. Okay, I'm listening to your lungs now… Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but clear. No wheezes or crackles noted. Now, listening to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a mild systolic murmur present. We'll need to investigate that further. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Your eyes appear healthy, but there's some mild lenticular opacity, consistent with age-related cataracts. Your vision seems intact. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. Overall, you appear to be in relatively good health for your age, but we did find a few things that warrant further investigation. We'll discuss those now.
PATIENT: A few things? Oh, boy. What things? I knew it. I knew something was wrong. Cataracts… murmur… what does that even mean? I don’t want any… procedures. I’m too old for procedures. I just want to keep working. Is it… serious? Be honest with me, Doctor. Don't sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth. As long as I can still do makeup. That's all that matters. And please, no needles. Absolutely no needles. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, let’s take this one step at a time. The mild systolic murmur I heard is common in older adults and doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. However, to be sure, I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm, and possibly an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. As for the cataracts, they’re also very common with age and can cause blurry vision. We can monitor them for now, and if they worsen and significantly impact your vision, we can discuss surgical options. The EKG is a simple, painless test where we place stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. As for the echocardiogram, it’s a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. Regarding needles, the EKG does not require any needles. And for the echocardiogram, we’ll use a handheld device on your chest – no injections are involved. These tests will give us a more detailed picture of your heart health and help us determine if any further treatment is needed. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. It never ends, does it? Stickers are okay, I suppose. As long as they don’t… poke. And no needles, you promised. No needles. An ultrasound… that sounds… less terrible. But what if they find something bad? What if I need… surgery? I’m too old for surgery. My heart is old. It won’t recover. I don't know, Doctor. I’m not sure I like this. Maybe I should just… ignore it. Pretend nothing is wrong. I can still see. I can still work. Maybe it’s best to just… leave it alone. Is that an option? Just… do nothing?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about tests and potential treatments. And yes, doing nothing is always an option. However, it’s important to remember that early detection and management of heart conditions can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent more serious complications down the road. Ignoring the murmur might allow you to continue with your current activities for a while, but it could also mean missing an opportunity to address a potentially worsening condition. Think of it this way: these tests aren't about finding something wrong necessarily; they're about gathering information so we can make informed decisions about your health. If the tests come back normal, then we’ll know everything is fine and you can continue with peace of mind. And if we do find something that needs attention, we’ll discuss all of your options and create a plan that’s right for you. We can start with just the EKG and see what that shows. We don’t need to commit to the echocardiogram right away. Would that feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Just the EKG… Alright. Just the stickers. No needles. That’s… manageable. But what if it shows something bad? Will you tell me the truth? No sugarcoating. I need to know what I’m dealing with. And… will it hurt? Will I feel anything? I don’t like pain. I’m a sensitive man. And… how long will it take? I have appointments. Important appointments. I can't be stuck here all day. I have faces to paint!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I promise to be completely honest with you, no sugarcoating. And the EKG is a very quick and painless procedure. It takes only a few minutes to set up, and then we’ll record your heart’s activity for about 30 seconds to a minute. You won't feel anything at all – just a slight coolness from the stickers. We'll have the results within a few hours. I’ll review them and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I'll get the order sent to the lab now, and they'll contact you to schedule the test. It should only take about 30 minutes of your time, start to finish. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Thirty minutes… I can manage thirty minutes. As long as there are no surprises. And no needles. You promised. Very well, Doctor. Send me to the lab. But please, make sure they know I’m a sensitive man. And… thank you. For not… completely dismissing me. I suppose… that’s all for now. Let’s get this over with. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I’m happy to help. I’ll have the lab contact you shortly to schedule your EKG. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's a copy of your visit summary and the order for the EKG. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
