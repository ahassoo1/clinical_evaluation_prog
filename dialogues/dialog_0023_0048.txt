DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this…fogginess. Like my head isn’t quite clear. My wife, she says I’ve been repeating myself, asking the same questions over and over. It’s…irritating, frankly. I always had a good memory. Still do, mostly. But these little gaps…they’re new.
DOCTOR: I see. “Fogginess” and some repetition…and your wife has noticed it. It is concerning when there's a change from your usual self, especially with memory. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to say exactly. Maybe…three, four months now? It started subtly. Just little things. Like forgetting where I put my tools – and I always know where my tools are. Then it became…more noticeable. My wife pointed it out after I asked her the same thing about dinner three times in one evening. It's not like I'm losing everything, you understand. Just…bits and pieces. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Three to four months…a gradual onset. And it's not a complete memory loss, just these…fragments. Understandable that it’s frustrating. Now, has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. I’ve been…a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I'm 66, Doctor. What wouldn’t be tired? And…well, my wife says I've been a bit more…irritable. But she always says that. Women. No, I can’t think of anything else, really. No headaches, no dizziness. Just the…fog.
DOCTOR: Right. Increased fatigue, and your wife notes increased irritability. We’ll note that. Now, let's delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. No problems since. And…high blood pressure. I take a pill for that. Been on it for…must be fifteen years now. Name escapes me, something with an ‘A’. Ask my wife, she keeps track of all that. Otherwise…no, nothing major. I’m a pretty healthy man, always have been. Worked with my hands my whole life. Keeps you strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cholecystectomy in the past, and hypertension, managed with medication. Do you recall the name of that medication, even approximately?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. Starts with an ‘A’…it’s a small white pill. Honestly, Doctor, I let my wife handle all the remembering of these things. She's very organized. I just take the pill when she tells me to. It’s…a lot of little details, you know? I focus on the work. Tiling, stone setting…that’s what I’m good at.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to verify the specific medication you are taking. Your wife’s help with that will be invaluable. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of memory problems—dementia, Alzheimer's—in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother…she wasn’t right towards the end. Very forgetful, confused. My wife says it was “dementia,” whatever that is. It’s just…old age, isn’t it? She didn’t recognize anyone towards the end. Sad, really. My father was fine as a tack, though. Always sharp as a nail. So, yes, on my mother’s side. Very upsetting.
DOCTOR: History of dementia in your mother. That is relevant. Now, tell me a bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a beer with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four a week. Nothing excessive, Doctor. I’m not a drinker. And I certainly don’t drink…hard liquor. It’s just a light beer to relax. And I don't smoke. Never have. I’ve always taken care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Moderate alcohol consumption, no smoking. Now, let’s quickly go through some allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always worries about me trying new foods, but I’ve never had a reaction. Never. I’m a pretty robust man, as I said. No allergies. None.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for providing all of this information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a simple neurological assessment—balance, reflexes, memory. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with. I have work to do, you know. I’m a busy man. But alright, do your examination. Just…don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat on the table here. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head. Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Strong enough? I still have plenty of strength, you know. Work keeps you strong. Always have been good with my hands.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is good, as you say. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Hmm. August…the second, isn’t it? August 2nd, 2025. I try to keep track of things. Though, as I said, little things slip sometimes. But yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. I can repeat three words. I have a good memory, remember? Don’t underestimate me.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Now, repeat those three words back to me.
PATIENT: Apple…table…hmm. What was the third one? It’s right on the tip of my tongue…penny! Yes, that's it. Apple, table, penny. There. See?
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about orientation. What city are we in?
PATIENT: What city…? Well, it’s…a suburb. A nice suburb. My wife likes it here. She picked it. I… I don’t recall the name right offhand. It’s not a big city, though. A quiet place.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the brief examination, and particularly your difficulty recalling the name of the city, there is some cause for concern. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these symptoms—the fogginess, the repetition, the memory lapses, and now difficulty with orientation—suggest a possible cognitive impairment. We need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions—vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and so on. And I strongly recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform detailed cognitive testing and, if necessary, imaging of your brain. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Imaging of my brain? What are you talking about? I just have a little…fog, a few memory slips. My wife worries too much. This is ridiculous. I don’t need a neurologist. I need a good night’s sleep. And maybe my wife should stop reminding me of every little thing. I’ll think about the blood work, but I’m not promising anything. This all seems…excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your reluctance. However, it’s crucial to take these symptoms seriously. Early detection and diagnosis are key when it comes to cognitive impairment. We’re not necessarily talking about a definitive diagnosis at this point, but we need to rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Ignoring these symptoms won’t make them go away, and delaying evaluation could limit treatment options if it is something serious. I will write the order for the blood work, and I strongly urge you to discuss the neurologist referral with your wife. I can provide you with a list of excellent neurologists in the area. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I believe it’s in your best interest to pursue further evaluation. .
