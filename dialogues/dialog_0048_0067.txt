DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, good afternoon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, it’s this pain… when I breathe deep. It hurts, you know? Not all the time, just when I… take a good breath. It's been happening for a little while now. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Old age," yes. Right. Well, pain with breathing can be… a number of things. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe… it’s… sharp. Like a little poke, but inside. Mostly on this side… <points vaguely to left side of chest> Not a bad bad pain, just… bothersome. It doesn't go anywhere, if that makes sense. Just stays there when I breathe in. I don't know if that helps. I get confused easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stays "there," you said. And sharp, with deep breaths. Does anything make it worse besides breathing?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. <pauses, rubs chin> Lifting things, maybe? I do a little work… construction, you know? But I don’t lift as much these days. It’s not a young man's job anymore. And… sometimes when I cough. But mostly just the breathing. I really can’t pinpoint it, doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Construction work… alright. And it’s been constant, this discomfort, even when you’re not lifting or coughing?
PATIENT: Constant… not exactly. It comes and goes. More often when I’m moving around, I think. Like I said, just bothersome. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a pain that stops me, just… reminds me I’m getting old. <shrugs> I don't want to bother you with something small, really.
DOCTOR: “Small” is relative, Mr. Ruocco. We need to figure out what’s causing it, regardless. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? <pauses, looks up at the ceiling> Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just because I am old. No cough, no fever, no… anything else I can think of. I eat okay, sleep okay. Nothing major. <fidgets with hands> I really just want to know if it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, then we'll go from there. Please take a deep breath when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just tell me what to do. <slightly anxious> I don't like being poked and prodded much, but I'll try my best. Just want this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Another one. <listens intently, brow furrowing> And one more. <removes stethoscope> Okay. Lungs sound… clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, a little bit of a murmur, which we’ve noted before, I see in your chart. <types into computer> Now, I’m going to palpate your chest wall. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Tender… hmm. <winces slightly as Dr. Sink touches a spot on his left side> Ooh, right there. That’s a little sore. Not bad, but… yeah. That’s where the pain is, I think. It’s not a sharp pain when you touch it, just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. I don’t remember hitting myself, though. <looks confused>
DOCTOR: Alright. Some tenderness there. And given your history with construction work, it could be musculoskeletal pain – strain or inflammation of the muscles or cartilage in your chest wall. However, given your age and the fact that it's associated with breathing, we need to rule out other possibilities. <types rapidly> I’m going to order a chest X-ray just to be safe. It’s a quick procedure. Would you be able to get to the imaging center today?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Oh. <frowns> I don't like those. Too much… radiation, right? I had one years ago, and… well, I’m not a fan. Can’t we just… take something for the pain? I don’t want to bother with a whole lot of tests. And… honestly, I don't have a ride to the imaging center. I rely on my son, and he’s working today. <looks pleadingly at Dr. Sink>
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns about radiation. However, an X-ray is the best way to quickly rule out more serious causes of your pain, like pneumonia or a fractured rib. The amount of radiation is minimal. As for transportation… <pauses, glances at the computer> Given your insurance status, I can write you a referral to the clinic’s transportation service. They can assist with getting you there. It’s a standard procedure. We'll get this sorted. But we need to get the X-ray done. It's for your own peace of mind, if nothing else.
PATIENT: <pauses, looks down at hands> Clinic transportation… hmm. Okay. If you think it’s important, I suppose I can do that. I just… don’t like being a bother. But if it will help find out what’s wrong… alright. Write me a referral. And… thank you, doctor. Just… please hurry. This pain is making me nervous. <shifts uncomfortably in chair> .
DOCTOR: Here you are. The transportation service will contact you to schedule a pickup. The imaging center is about a twenty-minute drive. I'll review the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter ibuprofen for the pain, as long as you don’t have any kidney problems. <looks at watch> If the pain worsens significantly – becomes severe, you have difficulty breathing, or you develop a fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
