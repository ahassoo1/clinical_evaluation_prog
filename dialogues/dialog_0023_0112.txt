DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive, to be perfectly frank. I’m not entirely sure why it started, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive. It’s… hard to explain. Just frequently. Throughout the day, and… sometimes at night, which is particularly bothersome. It impacts my work, and… honestly, it’s a bit stressful just thinking about it. I work as a concierge, and it requires being… available. It's difficult when one is constantly needing to find a restroom.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased urinary frequency. We need to get a better understanding of what “a lot” means, exactly. Could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Let me think. Normally, I’d say… maybe four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every hour or two. Perhaps even more often than that, especially if I drink anything – even water. It’s… quite a bit more than usual. I apologize for not having a precise number. It just… feels excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a significant increase from four or five times a day to every one to two hours, exacerbated by fluid intake. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning. It’s not… uncomfortable, exactly. Just… frequent. And a bit… inconvenient. It’s more of a constant urge than anything else. I don’t feel like I’m ever truly empty, if that makes sense. It’s rather frustrating. I hope that clarifies things a little?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And is there any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no blood. Not that I’ve noticed, at least. I… I always check, to be honest, because one worries, doesn’t one? But no, everything appears… normal in that regard. It’s just the sheer volume of trips, and the constant feeling. Do you… do you need me to provide a sample, perhaps? I’m happy to, if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: We'll get to that if necessary. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst?
PATIENT: Changes in my thirst… Hmm. That's a good question. I suppose I have been drinking more water, lately. Not dramatically, but… yes, I’ve been consciously trying to drink more. Perhaps because I'm going to the bathroom so often? I wasn't sure if that was the cause, or a result of it. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly. I hadn’t really connected the two, until you asked.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no lower back pain either, thankfully. I feel… generally well, aside from this ongoing… situation. It’s just… persistent. And a little worrisome, naturally. I haven’t felt any overall sickness, just this… frequency. Is it possible it’s something I ate? Or perhaps… stress related? I've been rather busy at work lately.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. Now, let’s go over some basics. Any family history of diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s… difficult. My mother… she had some health issues, but I wasn’t very close to her, and I don’t recall specifics. I believe she had high blood pressure, perhaps? As for kidney problems… I don’t believe so, but I honestly couldn't say with certainty. My father was… very healthy, as far as I know. I apologize for not being more helpful. My family wasn’t one for discussing medical matters openly. Is that… a problem? Should I try to find out more?
DOCTOR: It would be ideal to have that information, but we'll proceed as best we can. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I’m aware. I… I rarely take anything, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that's it. I try to avoid them whenever possible. Is there a particular medication you are thinking of? Or are you just making a general inquiry? I hope I'm not being difficult. I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No, just a standard question. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. As I said, I rarely take any medications. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. I truly don’t. I try to maintain a healthy diet, and I suppose I thought that would be enough. This is… rather concerning, if it’s not anything I’m doing. It must be something else, then. Perhaps a… a bladder infection? I've heard those can cause frequent urination. Is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: It is a possibility. Alright, Ms. MacVittie, I'm going to perform a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll check your abdomen, and I’ll perform a neurological exam. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam, of course. Yes. Please, lead the way. I do hope it won’t be too… intrusive? I'm rather… modest.
DOCTOR: It will be a basic abdominal palpation and a quick neurological assessment. Nothing to be concerned about. Please lie on your back with your arms at your sides. I'm checking for any tenderness or masses. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… no pain, not exactly. Just… a little pressure, perhaps? It’s… not comfortable, but not painful. It feels… routine, I suppose. Is everything alright? You seem rather… focused. I hope I’m not making this difficult.
DOCTOR: Routine is good. I’m checking your reflexes now. Reflexes are normal. Let’s check your gait. Could you stand and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. A gait test… very well. Is this alright? Am I walking correctly? I haven’t… been examined in years. It feels rather strange.
DOCTOR: Your gait appears normal. No apparent neurological deficits. Based on the physical exam, there’s no obvious cause for your increased urinary frequency. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. We'll also check your kidney function. It's standard procedure, Ms. MacVittie. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'll need a urine sample, of course. There’s a collection cup in the restroom.
PATIENT: A urinalysis and blood work… very well. That sounds… thorough. I understand. Standard procedure, of course. A urine sample… right. Yes, I can certainly provide one. I’ll go to the restroom now, then. Is there anything specific I should be aware of when collecting the sample? I want to be sure I do it correctly.
DOCTOR: Just a clean catch midstream is sufficient. There are instructions in the restroom. I’ll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they’re available. I'll contact you with the results and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A clean catch midstream… yes, I recall something about that. Thank you. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. I suppose… I’ll just wait to hear from you, then. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if… well, even if it’s a bit overwhelming. .
