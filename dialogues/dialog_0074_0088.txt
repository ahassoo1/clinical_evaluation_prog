DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Thanks for having me. Uh, it’s my ears, yeah? Been hearing a ringing sound... kinda annoying, to be honest. It’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That's something we can certainly look into. When you say “a bit now,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe a couple of months? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s louder, sometimes I barely notice it. It’s not constant, thankfully. I just want it to stop when it’s there, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: I understand. Intermittent tinnitus can be quite disruptive. A couple of months is helpful to know. And you’re right to want relief. Now, is it in one ear, both ears, or do you have trouble pinpointing the location?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, I think. It’s hard to say for sure sometimes. Like, it feels… inside my head more than in my ear, if that makes sense? I don't know if that helps. It's definitely worse on that side though.
DOCTOR: That does help, actually. Feeling it inside your head is a useful detail. And it's good you can localize it more to the right side. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well…loud noises definitely make it worse. Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking or, you know, music’s too loud, it gets really bad afterwards. Quiet places help, but it doesn’t just go away when it's quiet, if you catch my drift. Just…less noticeable. Oh, and stress. Stress makes it way worse. I got divorced last year, so… yeah, a bit stressful.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your divorce, Jaylyne. That is a significant stressor. And you're absolutely right to connect that to your symptoms – stress is often a major factor with tinnitus. Loud noises triggering it is also a key piece of information. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly now. Have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in either ear?
PATIENT: Nah, no dizziness or anything like that. My hearing feels okay, I guess. I mean, I don’t go to concerts or anything, so I haven’t really noticed any loss. But… I work as a waiter, so it’s noisy in the restaurant sometimes. People are always shouting, you know? But it's not like I can’t hear at all. Just…tired ears, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jaylyne. Working in a busy restaurant certainly exposes you to a lot of noise, and fatigue can definitely play a role. Okay, so no dizziness, no significant hearing loss, just the tinnitus and some ear fatigue. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had any ear infections recently, or any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No ear infections, not for ages. And… uh, nothing major, I don't think. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? I’ve got private insurance, so I see a doctor when I need to. They haven't found anything serious before. I'm fairly healthy, I reckon. I try to be, anyway. I just want this ringing to stop. It's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and it’s helpful to know you’re generally healthy. Alright, Jaylyne, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your ears, and possibly a brief hearing test just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just wanna figure out what’s going on with my ears, you know? Hopefully it’s nothing serious. Let’s get it over with, eh? I've got work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll work as quickly as we can. First, let’s take a look at your ears with an otoscope. This just allows me to see the ear canal and eardrum. Okay, your ear canals appear clear, and your eardrums are both intact and normal in color. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I’m going to do a quick tuning fork test to assess your bone and air conduction. This will help us understand where the sound is being affected. Your results are… slightly diminished in your right ear, which correlates with what you've been experiencing. It's subtle, but present. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tinnitus, possibly related to noise exposure and stress. We call it sensorineural hearing loss, which isn’t caused by infection but by damage to the tiny hair cells in your inner ear. It is often temporary but can become persistent.
PATIENT: Okay… “sensorineural hearing loss.” Sounds… serious. Is there anything I can do about it? Will it get worse? I really don't want it to get worse. And is the stress making it worse, or is it the other way around? It's just so frustrating, you know? I just want peace and quiet. .
DOCTOR: It sounds serious, I understand, but it’s very common, and often manageable. Many people live quite normal lives with tinnitus. It's rarely a sign of a more serious underlying condition, especially given your history. The good news is there are things we can do. The stress and the noise exposure are likely both contributing to the problem, creating a bit of a cycle. Stress can worsen the perception of tinnitus, and noise exposure can further irritate the inner ear. First, we want to minimize further noise exposure as much as possible. I recommend wearing earplugs at work when it gets loud, even if it's just foam ones. Second, stress management is key. Have you ever tried relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga?
