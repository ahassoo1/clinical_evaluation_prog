DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 66 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, sixty-six, that’s right. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I'm having a bit of trouble...going. It just takes me a long time, and sometimes it doesn't feel like I can quite empty everything, you know? It’s been going on for…oh, a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And you mentioned difficulty initiating and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Could you describe the stream itself?
PATIENT: The stream? Hmm…well, it’s not weak, exactly. It starts, but it’s…thin. Like trying to water a plant with a very small hose. And then it kind of sputters, stops, starts again. It’s not a powerful flow, if that makes sense. It’s just…unreliable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Unreliable…thin and intermittent. And is this happening with every urination, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: No, it’s not every time. Some times it’s perfectly normal, like it used to be. Other times it’s…this. More often now, though, it's the sputtering and thin stream. It seems worse when I’m in a rush, if that matters. Like if I drink a lot of tea and then need to go out somewhere.
DOCTOR: Worse with urgency. And tea…do you consume a lot of caffeine regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a fair bit. I like my tea. It’s a habit, really. Black tea, mostly. Maybe three or four cups a day, sometimes more if I’m having visitors. I’ve been drinking it since I was a girl, honestly. Do you think that could be it?
DOCTOR: Caffeine can certainly contribute to urinary frequency and urgency. However, given the intermittent nature and sensation of incomplete emptying, we need to investigate further. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning at all. Not a bit. Just…frustrating. It takes so long, and I worry about not finishing properly, if that makes sense. It's not comfortable, but not painful, no. And no fever or anything like that either. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no burning, no fever. Just the difficulty and incomplete emptying. Do you experience any difficulty starting the stream, or is it just maintaining it that's the problem?
PATIENT: Hmm…it’s both, I think. Sometimes it takes me a moment to get it going, like I have to…push a little bit. And then it’s the sputtering. So it’s hard to start and hard to keep going steadily. Like a car that keeps stalling, if you know what I mean? Not a very good analogy, perhaps. But that’s how it feels.
DOCTOR: A reasonable analogy, Ms. Yadao. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine…let me think. No, not really. It looks the same as always, I suppose. The normal color…no blood, no cloudiness, nothing like that. Sometimes it smells a little stronger than it used to, but I'm not sure if that's just because I'm drinking more tea. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Stronger odor can be indicative of a number of things, though it’s not necessarily concerning on its own. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. The doctor prescribed something for it, and it helps. Otherwise, I’m generally pretty healthy. I’ve been lucky, I think. Oh, and I had the flu shot last fall, of course.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, some arthritis, and up to date on your flu vaccine. Very good. And have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the gallbladder. And I haven't been hospitalized for anything in…oh, goodness, I couldn't even tell you when. Decades, I suppose. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can. They don't smell very nice, and I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken various things over the years – antibiotics, pain relievers, the arthritis medicine – and never had a reaction. I’m pretty careful, though. I always tell the pharmacist everything. I don’t like to take risks with those things.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medicine, it’s called…let me see if I can remember…Naproxen. Yes, that's it. Two pills a day for the arthritis. And sometimes, if my head aches, I’ll take a Tylenol, but not very often. That’s it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Naproxen and occasional Tylenol. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – bladder problems, kidney issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother had a little bit of trouble with her kidneys when she got older, but I don’t know the details, really. She didn’t talk about those things much. And my father…he was healthy as a horse, until the very end. No, I don’t think there’s anything major that runs in the family, thankfully. My sister has high blood pressure, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, some kidney issues in your mother, high blood pressure in your sister. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Social history? What does that mean? Do you mean…do I go dancing? No, not anymore. My knees aren't what they used to be. I live alone, in my own house. I’ve been a widow for…oh, twenty years now. I keep myself busy, mostly with gardening. And reading. I like a good mystery novel.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. I was referring to smoking, alcohol consumption and occupation. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh! I see. No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it, but I wouldn't allow it in the house. And I don't drink alcohol very often. Maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, or with a special meal. Nothing regular. And as I said, I used to work at the post office. I’m retired now, though. Been a good few years since I sorted any mail.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Yadao, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with what we call lower urinary tract symptoms, or LUTS. Given your age, it could be a number of things, including an overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia – though this is less common in women – or a bladder infection, though you don’t have any pain or fever, which makes that less likely. The next step would be a physical exam and a urinalysis to rule out any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam and a urine test. Of course. I want to get to the bottom of this. It's just… frustrating, you know? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. Yes, let’s do the tests. What does the exam involve? Will it be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: The exam will involve a general abdominal exam, listening to your abdomen and feeling for any abnormalities. Then, I’ll perform a pelvic exam. I'll visually inspect the area and gently palpate your bladder to assess its fullness and check for any tenderness. I'll also need to do a rectal exam to assess muscle tone. I understand your concern about discomfort. I will explain everything as I go and stop if you experience any pain. We will start slowly. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh. A rectal exam? I… hadn’t expected that. What exactly… what are you looking for? Is it…necessary? I’m not comfortable with that part, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Yadao. A rectal exam allows me to assess the pelvic floor muscles and evaluate for any masses or abnormalities that may be contributing to your symptoms. It's a standard part of the evaluation for urinary issues in women, particularly to rule out any structural problems. While it may be uncomfortable, it’s very quick and provides valuable information. However, if you are absolutely opposed to it, we can proceed without it, but I will need to advise you that it may limit my ability to make an accurate diagnosis. We can discuss alternative imaging options, like an ultrasound, but those won't provide the same level of detail about the pelvic floor muscles. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm…an ultrasound doesn’t sound too bad. But you think it’s important? Really important? I just…I don't like the idea of that part. It feels…invasive. If the ultrasound can give you enough information, maybe we could try that first? I’m just…nervous, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Yadao. We can start with an ultrasound to assess your bladder and kidneys. It won't provide the full picture regarding the pelvic floor muscles, but it's a reasonable first step given your anxiety. I'll write an order for that now. In the meantime, I'm going to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection. The lab will need a sample of your urine. Do you have any issues with providing that?
PATIENT: No, the urine test is fine. I can do that. As long as I don’t have to… you know. I can go to the restroom right now, if you need me to. Yes, let’s do the tests. The ultrasound and the urine. That sounds… manageable. When will I be able to get the results? And will you explain them to me, like you explained everything else?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have the nurse bring you a sterile cup for the urine sample. There's a restroom just down the hall. As for the results, it usually takes 24-48 hours to get the ultrasound report, and the urinalysis results should be back within a few hours. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and determine the next steps. I will explain everything to you in detail, just as I have been. We'll go through it together. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better now, knowing what’s going to happen. A follow-up appointment next week, and you’ll explain everything to me. That’s very kind of you. I’ll go and get the cup for the urine now. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. The nurse will guide you. Just make sure to collect a midstream sample - that is, start urinating, then collect the sample about halfway through. Don’t hesitate to ask her if you have any questions. I'll leave the order with the nurse and she'll be right in to assist you. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you at this time.
PATIENT: Oh, midstream. Right. I remember that from… somewhere. Thank you again, Doctor. No, I think that’s everything for now. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ll see you next week.
