DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Yoshino. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, numbness in my leg. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. That's definitely worth getting checked out. When you say "a little while," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began approximately three weeks ago, on or around June 15th, I believe. It started very subtly, just a slight tingling sensation in my left foot, and has gradually progressed to encompass more of my leg. Now, it’s mostly in my calf and sometimes extends up to my knee.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three weeks, starting June 15th. Gradual progression, starting in the foot and now up to your knee in your left leg. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… inconsistent, I suppose is the best way to describe it. It’s not always there. There are periods throughout the day where I don’t notice it at all, particularly when I’m actively working. But if I’ve been standing or walking for an extended time, it tends to return, and then lingers for a while afterward. Also, it seems more pronounced in the evenings.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's related to activity – worse with standing and walking, and more noticeable in the evenings. Does anything specific make it better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Rest, definitely. Elevating my leg seems to help, though I haven’t been particularly diligent about doing that regularly. And… warm water. Soaking it in warm water provides some temporary relief, but it doesn't last long. I haven't tried anything else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, rest and warm water help temporarily. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no weakness. My balance feels perfectly normal. I haven’t stumbled or anything like that. And I haven't experienced any pain associated with it, just the numbness. It's… disconcerting, more than anything. It doesn’t hurt, it just… isn’t there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Disconcerting is a good way to describe it. No pain, no weakness, just numbness. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color or temperature in that leg, compared to your other leg?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I believe so. It's subtle, but I have noticed that my left leg does appear slightly paler than my right leg, particularly when the numbness is present. And it does feel a bit colder to the touch, though I initially dismissed that as simply being a result of the numbness itself. It’s difficult to say for certain, but I’d say there’s a noticeable difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, paler skin and feeling colder in the left leg when the numbness is present. That’s helpful to know. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or any circulation problems?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No diagnosed medical conditions, no circulation problems that I am aware of. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I haven’t been to a doctor in a few years, aside from a routine check-up in 2022, and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the insurance and the normal check-up in 2022. No diagnosed medical conditions. Have you had any recent injuries to your leg or back?
PATIENT: No, no recent injuries. I haven’t had any falls, bumps, or strains that I can recall. I work as a special effects artist and animator, so I spend most of my time sitting at a computer or working with my hands. It's not a particularly physically demanding job, so the risk of injury is relatively low. I haven’t done anything out of the ordinary that could have caused this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent injuries. Let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with diabetes, nerve problems, or circulation issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother’s side of the family has a history of hypertension, but nothing related to diabetes, nerve problems, or circulation issues, as far as I know. My father’s side… my paternal grandfather did have some issues with his feet later in life, but it wasn't ever specifically diagnosed. He just complained about them being cold and uncomfortable frequently. He lived in rural Alaska for most of his life, so access to proper medical care was limited.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of hypertension on your mother’s side, and some undiagnosed foot issues in your paternal grandfather. Let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally drink alcohol, perhaps one or two beers a month, but I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, mostly focused on my work and hobbies. I maintain a healthy diet and try to get regular exercise when I can, though admittedly, sitting at a computer for long hours doesn't lend itself to that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to any medications. I've taken common over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen without issue. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to foods or environmental factors, either. I believe that covers everything, Dr. Yoshino. Please let me know if you require any further information.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Thank you for that thorough history, Tarin. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed when you're ready, Dr. Yoshino. I’ll do my best to remain still and cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, please have a seat here. I'm going to start by checking your pulses in both legs and feet. Then, I’ll test your reflexes and sensation. After that, I’ll take a look at your skin and muscles. Okay, your pulses feel a little weaker on the left side compared to the right, but still present. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Okay, there's slightly decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick on the top of your left foot and calf, compared to your right. I notice your left leg does appear a bit paler than your right, and the skin feels slightly cooler to the touch, as you mentioned. No significant swelling or muscle loss. No tenderness to palpation along the shin bones. Alright, thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam findings – the slightly weaker pulse, decreased sensation, and paler skin in your left leg – it’s possible we’re dealing with a problem with circulation or a nerve issue. It’s not immediately alarming, but we need to investigate further to determine the cause. I'd like to order a few tests. First, a Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow in your legs. And a nerve conduction study to evaluate the function of the nerves in your lower extremities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Yoshino. I appreciate your thoroughness. A Doppler ultrasound and a nerve conduction study… yes, that sounds alright. I trust your judgment. Please let me know the logistics of scheduling those tests, and if there’s anything I need to do to prepare. I’m ready to proceed with whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule those for you before you leave. The Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive; you'll just lie on the table while a technician moves a probe over your legs. The nerve conduction study involves some mild electrical stimulation, which can be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful. She'll provide you with specific instructions, but generally, avoid applying lotion to your legs on the day of the test. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and keeping your legs warm. Also, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of Vitamin D. Sometimes, nerve issues can be exacerbated by vitamin deficiencies. We'll review the results together as soon as they're available, and we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That all sounds very manageable, Dr. Yoshino. No, I don’t believe I have any immediate questions. Elevate my leg, avoid prolonged standing, keep it warm, and take the Vitamin D… I can certainly do that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and thoroughly. And thank you for being so patient with my… detailed recollections. I suppose I’ll just wait for Sarah to schedule the tests then. I’m grateful for your help, and I look forward to discussing the results with you when they’re ready.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. It’s my job, and you’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns before your appointments. Sarah will be with you shortly to schedule those tests. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. You as well. .
