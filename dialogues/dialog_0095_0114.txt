DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. It gets very difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing when lying flat – that’s definitely something we need to look into. When you say “difficult,” can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it feels… like there’s a weight on my chest. And I have to really work to get enough air. It's not a sharp pain, not exactly. More like… a squeezing feeling. It wakes me up sometimes, actually, trying to breathe. It’s rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing sensation, more like a weight, that worsens when lying down and wakes you up at night. That’s helpful. And how long would you say this has been going on – a few weeks, you mentioned, but has it been steadily getting worse, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It has been a few weeks, yes. And it’s… gradually gotten worse, I think. At first, I just noticed it when I tried to take a nap. Now, it happens almost every time I lie down. Not every single time, but most times. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting up or walking around, thankfully. Just when I’m trying to sleep, or even just resting in bed.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s positional – meaning it's related to lying down – and has been progressively worsening over a few weeks. Do you notice anything else happening when you're having trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Sometimes my ankles swell up a bit. Not terribly, but I notice it. And I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more than usual. But I’m 71, Doctor, so perhaps that’s just… age. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in the ankles and increased fatigue. We’ll definitely keep those in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known heart conditions, or have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. The regular doctor always checked my blood pressure, and it was always… normal, I suppose. And no diabetes, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I did have a bit of trouble with arthritis in my hands, but that’s about it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known heart conditions, hypertension, or diabetes. Just some arthritis in the hands. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Perhaps 30 years ago? And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, a very silly accident. But other than that… no, not really. Nothing major, I don’t think. It was a long time ago. I’m trying to recall everything, but my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal a long time ago and a wrist fracture. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any heart problems, lung conditions, or other serious illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her legs towards the end of her life, swelling, I believe. But I don’t recall anything about her heart. And my father… he lived a long, healthy life. No major illnesses that I’m aware of. My brother… he had high blood pressure, I think, but he didn’t take care of himself very well. It’s hard to say, really. We weren't very close.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some swelling in your mother's legs, and your brother had high blood pressure. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. Always been that way. I always thought it was best to avoid those things. Not good for your health, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. Naproxen, I believe it’s called. I take one a day, sometimes two if my hands are particularly sore. And that's it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis. Thank you. Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'm going to check your legs for swelling, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I’d like to get this sorted out, if possible. It’s rather unsettling, not being able to breathe properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me. And another. Good. I'm hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, especially on the lower left side. And I do notice some swelling in your ankles, a bit more on the right than the left. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. These findings suggest some fluid buildup in your lungs, which could be causing the difficulty breathing. The ankle swelling also points to possible heart failure, though we need to do further testing to confirm that. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and I’d like to get some blood work done as well, including a BNP level, which can help us assess your heart function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? That sounds… serious. But yes, Doctor, if that’s what you think is best, then please do. X-ray, EKG, blood work… whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I just want to be able to breathe normally again. And quickly, if possible. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Or any… precautions I should take? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: It's good that we're looking into this now. And don't worry too much about the term "heart failure." It doesn't necessarily mean your heart has stopped working; it just means it's not pumping as efficiently as it should be. For the chest X-ray, no preparation is needed. The technician will just ask you to remove any jewelry. For the EKG, we'll need to put some stickers on your chest and limbs. As for the blood work, you'll need to fast for eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except water. In the meantime, it’s important to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And I recommend you elevate your legs when you're resting, to help reduce the swelling. We'll get the results of these tests back as quickly as possible and discuss them with you then. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… yes, I can do that. And no food… eight hours. I think I can manage that. Chest pain… shortness of breath… I will keep an eye out. Doctor, if it is something serious with my heart… what are the… options? What kind of treatment is available? I don’t like to dwell on the worst-case scenarios, but I like to be prepared. And… how long will it take to get these test results back? I understand you're busy, but the waiting is rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question. If it turns out to be heart failure, the treatment options depend on the severity. We might start with medications to help your heart pump more efficiently, reduce fluid buildup, and lower your blood pressure. Lifestyle changes, like reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight, are also important. In some cases, more advanced treatments, like implantable devices or surgery, might be necessary, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. As for the test results, I’m hoping to have them back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you feel anxious, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Let's focus on getting these tests done first. It's important to have all the information before we make any decisions. And please remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that's all for now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with my questions. I appreciate it very much. I suppose I should go home and… try to elevate my legs. And not eat anything for eight hours. It sounds like a long time. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. I’ll wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry too much about the fasting. It'll pass quickly. Take your time, and please let the nurse know if you have any trouble getting home. We'll be in touch soon.
