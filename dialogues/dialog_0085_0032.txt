DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Lahn, you say? Hmm. Yes, well… it’s a rather… delicate matter. A bit embarrassing, to be frank. My wife insisted I come. Something about… a leak. A troublesome leak, down there. I haven't the foggiest idea what's causing it, and frankly, I don't much care for poking around trying to find it. It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. It is often uncomfortable discussing these things, and it’s very common. You’re doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. It’s good your wife encouraged you. We can certainly figure out what's going on, and I’ll do my best to make the examination as comfortable as possible. When you say “leak,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: A leak… yes. Well, it’s… discharge, I believe my wife called it. A bit of… fluid. Not a flood, mind you. More of a… dampness. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I can’t rightly say. A week? Perhaps longer. Time does seem to slip away these days. And it’s not painful, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. And rather… unsettling. I keep having to change my undergarments, which is undignified at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, “discharge” and not painful, just inconvenient and causing you to change your undergarments. And you estimate it’s been going on for about a week, maybe longer. That helps. Now, has there been any change in your urination – any burning, urgency, or difficulty starting or stopping?
PATIENT: Urination… hmm. Let me think. No burning, no. And urgency… well, I suppose I go somewhat more frequently than I used to, but that could just be the age, couldn’t it? Old bladder, you know. As for difficulty… no, not really. It starts alright, and stops when it's supposed to. Though, now that you mention it, the stream isn’t quite as… robust as it once was. But that’s a problem for another day, I suspect. This discharge is the pressing matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no burning with urination, possibly slightly increased frequency, and a weaker stream, but you’re primarily concerned with the discharge. That’s helpful. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… goodness. Let me see. No fever, no chills. No pain in my lower back. No swelling, as far as I can tell. It hasn’t… interfered with anything, if you catch my meaning. Just… this bothersome leak. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been paying terribly close attention. I’m an old man; things ache and leak all the time. It usually resolves itself. My wife just insisted this one needed a doctor’s attention. She worries unduly, that woman.
DOCTOR: It’s good your wife is looking out for you, even if she does worry a bit! And it’s perfectly understandable that you haven’t been paying close attention to everything. Okay, so no fever, chills, back pain, or any interference with… normal function. Just the discharge, no pain, and occurring for about a week or longer. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… a rather long and dreary tale, I assure you. Let me see. High blood pressure, yes, for years. Managed with… pills. A little blue one, I believe. And… arthritis, in my hands and knees. Makes it difficult to garden, which is a great sorrow. And… I had a prostate operation, oh, many years ago. Back in the… seventies, I think it was. Something about being enlarged. They took some of it out. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful, Mr. Krok. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a prostate operation in the seventies. Knowing you had a prostate procedure is particularly important. And the blue pill is likely a medication for your blood pressure – good to know you're taking something for that. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication… now that’s a tricky one. My wife handles all the pill sorting, you see. I just take them as instructed. It’s a… small, blue pill. Round, I think. And… it has markings on it, but I couldn’t tell you what they are. Honestly, Doctor, I’m hopeless with names and details these days. My mind isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps my wife could tell you?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It's very common to have trouble remembering medication names, especially when you have multiple prescriptions. We can certainly ask your wife. No need to worry about that now. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I used to be terribly allergic to dust, as a boy, but that cleared up years ago. And I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife is a wonderful cook, and I enjoy a good appetite. No, no allergies. At least, none that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we proceed with a brief physical exam, I’d like to ask about your family history. Have any close relatives – parents, siblings, children – had any significant medical conditions, such as prostate cancer or urinary problems?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. Another long tale, I suspect. My father… he had a bad heart, I believe. Died young, quite suddenly. My mother lived to be a ripe old age, but she was always a bit… vague about her ailments. She swore by herbal remedies and never went to a doctor. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. Lost a leg to it, poor fellow. As for my children… they’re all healthy, thankfully. As far as I know. They live far away and don’t confide in me much these days. As for prostate problems… now that I don’t recall anyone having. No, I don’t believe so.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart problems, mother with unspecified ailments, brother with diabetes, and no known prostate problems in the family. That’s helpful. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your abdomen. I will also need to do a genital exam to assess the source of the discharge. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… well, I suppose it’s necessary. I’d rather not, if I’m being honest, but my wife would have my hide if I refused. Listening to my heart and lungs, that’s fine. Checking my abdomen, I suppose. But… the genital exam… that sounds rather… intrusive, Doctor. I am an old man, after all. And… a bit sensitive, if you catch my meaning. Please be gentle, and explain everything as you go. And… hurry, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok, and I assure you I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. We will take things at your pace, and I will explain everything thoroughly before each step. The genital exam is important to help determine the cause of the discharge. It will involve a visual inspection and possibly a gentle touch to feel for any abnormalities. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I will begin with listening to your heart and lungs. Would you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. Just… please be quick about it. And… try not to stare. It's rather embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this instrument. It may be a little cool against your skin. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright. My abdomen… it’s a bit tender, sometimes. Old age, you know. And… I had some trouble with indigestion recently. Be careful around… here.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m starting gently here, and then I’ll move towards where you indicated. I do feel some slight tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you mentioned. No masses or significant guarding. It’s likely related to your indigestion. Now, to get a better understanding of the source of the discharge, I'm going to need to do a quick genital exam. As I mentioned before, I will explain each step as I go, and you can stop me at any time. Would you please turn onto your side?
PATIENT: Must we, Doctor? It’s rather undignified. And… cold. Please be quick, and… gentle. I’m an old man, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just going to visually inspect the area first. I see some redness and a small amount of discharge at the opening of the urethra. There is no obvious sign of injury or ulceration. There is some mild tenderness along the urethra. I don’t see anything immediately concerning, but I would like to collect a small urine sample and send it to the lab for analysis. This will help us determine if there's an infection present. Do you think you can provide a sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, I suppose I can manage that. Though it's been a struggle lately, if I’m being honest. Old bladder, you know. Where do I…
DOCTOR: Right here, Mr. Krok. I’ll leave you some privacy to collect the sample. Just try to relax, and let me know when you’re finished. We'll send it off to the lab and get the results back as soon as possible.
PATIENT: .
