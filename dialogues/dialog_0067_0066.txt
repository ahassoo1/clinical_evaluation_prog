DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It says here you’re 40 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, forty years old. It’s this… sensation in my back. It’s hard to explain, really. It’s like a “popping” or “clicking” sound and feeling when I move certain ways. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back for a few weeks. That is something we should take a look at. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not constant, thankfully. It usually happens when I’m… well, when I’m bending over to lift something, or twisting, especially at work. I install and repair electrical systems in transportation equipment – mostly buses and trains – so there’s a lot of awkward positioning. It doesn't feel painful, exactly, but it’s… unsettling. And I worry it will become painful if I don't get it checked out. It’s higher up on my back, between my shoulder blades, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Between the shoulder blades... and it’s related to bending and twisting at work, which sounds physically demanding. So, no sharp pain, just the sensation of popping and clicking?
PATIENT: That’s right. No sharp pain, no numbness or tingling, thankfully. Just the sound and the feeling of something… moving. It’s a bit hard to describe the feeling. Like a slight… release, maybe? And it doesn't radiate anywhere, it stays right in that spot between my shoulder blades. I did notice it’s a bit worse after a long day at work, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sensation of a release, localized between the shoulder blades, worsening with activity and at the end of the workday. Have you tried anything to alleviate it so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I’ve been trying to stretch more, you know, simple back stretches. And I’ve been trying to be more mindful of my posture, especially when lifting things – bending my knees and keeping my back straight. I also tried some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen – but it doesn't seem to really affect the popping or clicking, just maybe takes the edge off if I'm feeling particularly sore. Nothing significant, though.
DOCTOR: Good, you’ve been proactive with stretching, posture and trying ibuprofen. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, thankfully. No major illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I do have slightly high blood pressure, diagnosed about five years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Other than that… I’m a pretty simple case, Doctor. I eat a reasonably healthy diet, though my wife would say I enjoy a good Cuban sandwich a bit too much. I don’t smoke and I only drink socially. I have private insurance through my union.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension is good to know, as is the family history of good health, and the lifestyle choices. Let's talk about medications. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I’m currently taking lisinopril, 20 milligrams once a day. I've been on it for about five years now, and my blood pressure readings have been consistently good, according to my primary care physician. He checks it every six months. I haven't had any side effects from it, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisopril 20mg daily, blood pressure well controlled. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had any issues with pollen, dust, or animals, either. My wife is a little allergic to cats, but that’s her problem, not mine!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent injuries, falls, or anything else that might be related to your back discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing significant. I haven't had any falls or major injuries. I did strain my back a little a few months ago lifting a heavy electrical panel at work, but it wasn’t a serious strain, just a bit sore for a couple of days. I took it easy, used some ice packs, and it resolved on its own. I don’t recall any specific incident that triggered this current popping and clicking sensation. It just seemed to gradually develop over the past few weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant injury, gradual onset. Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up and I’ll take a look at your range of motion and feel along your spine?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds good. Please let me know if I need to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you bend forward and touch your toes, or as close as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: I can get about halfway down, but it’s a little stiff. It feels… tighter than usual in my lower back, but no sharp pain. I can feel the slight resistance in the upper back as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight restriction with forward bending, no sharp pain reported. Now, can you bend backwards, gently, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: That’s a little more limited, honestly. It feels a bit tight. Not painful, just… restricted. I feel that resistance again in that area between my shoulder blades.
DOCTOR: Okay, restricted in both forward and backward bending. Now, I’m going to gently feel along your spine, checking for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Please let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive. I notice some slight tenderness to palpation between the shoulder blades, at about the T4-T6 vertebral levels. No obvious muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited in all directions, but no acute pain with movement. I do not note any skin changes or masses.
PATIENT: Okay, that's... yes, that's a little tender. Right there, between my shoulder blades. Not painful exactly, but I can definitely feel it when you press there. The rest feels… normal, I guess. Just a little tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness localized to the T4-T6 area. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have some muscle strain or joint dysfunction in your mid-back. The repetitive motions at work could certainly contribute to that. It's not presenting as anything acutely serious, which is reassuring. I’d like to order a few X-rays of your thoracic spine just to rule out any other underlying issues, like fractures or significant arthritis, but based on the clinical picture, I suspect we’ll find it’s a musculoskeletal problem. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I appreciate you explaining it to me. X-rays sound like a good idea, just to be sure. I'd rather be safe than sorry, especially considering the type of work I do. So, if you think that's the best course of action, I agree completely. Are the X-rays done here, at the clinic? And what happens after the X-rays?
DOCTOR: Yes, we have an X-ray machine here at the clinic. I’ll write an order for you, and the technician will get you set up. It’s a quick and painless procedure. After the X-rays are taken, the radiologist will review them and send me the results, usually within 24-48 hours. I will then contact you to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing the stretches you’ve been doing, maintaining good posture, and avoiding any activities that significantly aggravate your symptoms. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options if needed. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very good plan, Doctor. Thank you. Continuing the stretches and avoiding aggravation seems sensible, and I’m happy to discuss pain relief options if needed. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. Should I just go to the X-ray technician now? And will the results be sent directly to you, or will I need to do something?
DOCTOR: Yes, please head to the X-ray technician. The results will be sent directly to me, so you don't need to do anything. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience any new numbness or tingling, weakness, or severe pain – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That answers everything, and I feel much better knowing what's going on and having a plan. Thank you again for your time and attention. I'll go find the X-ray technician now. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Have a good day, Mr. Mastrantonio, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. We'll get those X-rays taken and go from there. .
PATIENT: .
