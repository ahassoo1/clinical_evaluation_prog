DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full awful quick, see? I don't even get to finish a proper plate of food before I’m stuffed. It’s been going on for a bit now, and my wife, bless her, she says I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full very quickly, even with smaller portions, and it’s been happening for a while. That's good of your wife to encourage you to come in. Let’s talk about that a little more. When you say “a bit now,” roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? At first, I just figured I was getting old, you know? Losing my appetite. But it’s not that, it's just… full too fast. It’s not a comfortable feeling, either. Feels kinda… stretched out, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it's good you're paying attention to how it feels, not just dismissing it. Six or seven months is definitely long enough to investigate. And you’re right, describing the feeling is very helpful. “Stretched out”… okay. Does that fullness happen with everything you eat, or are there certain foods that bother you more than others?
PATIENT: Good question. I think… it's worse with heavier foods, like meat and potatoes. Soup, now, I can usually manage a whole bowl. And fruit doesn’t bother me none. But a good plate of salmon and rice? Forget about it. Halfway through and I’m already feeling it. My wife makes a mean salmon, too, so it’s a real shame, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, heavier foods like meat and potatoes cause more trouble than lighter options like soup and fruit. That's a helpful detail. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… well, sometimes I get a little heartburn, but I always figured that was just from enjoying a good meal too much. And maybe a bit of gas now and then. But nothing real bad. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. I do tire easier than I used to, but I chalked that up to being… well, 88 years old, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good information. Heartburn and some gas, but not severe. And you've attributed the fatigue to age, which is reasonable. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was ages ago. And the doctor told me years back my blood pressure was a little high, so I took some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them after a bit. Didn't seem to make much difference. My wife always said I just needed to slow down. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, probably ten years, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in your youth and a history of high blood pressure that you were treated for but stopped taking medication for. And it's been about ten years since your last check-up. That's alright, we'll get things updated. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not right now. I tried some of those heartburn tablets a few times, but they didn’t seem to do much good, so I stopped bothering with them. Mostly just drink a glass of milk if I get a bad case of it. And my wife gives me vitamins, but I can't rightly remember what kind. She handles all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications currently, just occasional milk for heartburn and vitamins your wife provides. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks when she’s cooking, bless her. She's very careful. We've been married a long time, and she keeps me healthy, that’s for sure. I think I'm pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Alright, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father, he had a bad heart. Passed away when he was in his 70s, I think. And my mother, she had… well, I don't really remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago. She passed away when I was young. My wife might know more about it. She does all the family record keeping. I'm not much for remembering names and dates, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease on your father’s side. That's good to know. We can always check with your wife if you'd like. Now, just a couple more questions. Regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. And I used to enjoy a little whiskey now and then, but I haven’t had a drink in… oh, goodness, maybe twenty years. My wife convinced me it was best. As for activity… I used to be a fisherman, a real active one. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just take short walks around the house and garden. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no smoking, no current alcohol use, and limited physical activity. Alright, Mr. Obarr, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 158/85. That's a little elevated. Now, I’m listening to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a particularly loud murmur, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. And I don't feel any masses or enlarged organs. Okay, that gives us a little bit of information. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing early satiety – feeling full quickly – which could be related to several things. Your blood pressure is elevated and the murmur warrants further investigation. The tenderness in your upper abdomen could be a clue, too. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some tests to check for liver function. I’d also like to order an upper endoscopy to look at your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Whoa, slow down now, Doctor. Endoscopy? That sounds… serious. What exactly are we looking for? And what's all this about liver function? I haven't been drinking for years. And I feel alright, mostly. Just full too quickly. Maybe we could start with just the blood tests? I'm not sure I'm ready for anything… invasive just yet.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask questions and express your concerns. An endoscopy is a more involved procedure, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to start with less invasive tests. We’ll proceed at your pace, Mr. Obarr. Let me explain why I suggested these tests. The blood tests will give us a baseline understanding of your overall health, including checking for anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Even if you haven't been drinking, the liver can be affected by other things, and it’s important to rule out any issues there. Now, regarding the endoscopy… the reason I suggested it is that early satiety can be caused by several things, including problems in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum – like gastritis, ulcers, or even something like a slow-growing tumor. The endoscopy allows us to directly visualize those areas and take biopsies if needed. It's important to remember that most of the time, these symptoms are caused by something relatively harmless, like gastritis. But we need to rule out anything more serious. We can absolutely start with the blood tests first, and then we can discuss the endoscopy again after we have the results. Would that make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. Blood tests first. That I can handle. I just… I don’t want to go through anything unnecessary. What do I have to do for the blood tests? Do I have to fast or anything? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable request, and we'll definitely proceed at your pace. For the blood tests, yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks except water. We’ll schedule the appointment for first thing in the morning. We’ll draw a few vials of blood, and the lab usually gets the results back within three to five business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and go over the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like persistent nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or blood in your stool – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the fasting requirements or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Eight hours, nothing but water. I can manage that. My wife will make sure of it. She’s always on me to eat healthy, anyway, so it’ll be easy enough. So, just three to five days to get the results. Alright. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. Let's go ahead and schedule those tests, then. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could explain everything to your satisfaction. Okay, I'm scheduling your blood tests for 8:00 AM on August 5th. You'll need to come to the clinic’s lab on the first floor. Please remind the lab technician you haven’t eaten anything for eight hours. Here's a lab requisition form. And here are some written instructions about fasting. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll see you on the 5th, then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. Have a good day as well, and I'll see you on the 5th.
