DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, no offense, but I don’t have all day for chit-chat. I’m just tired. Really tired. And…well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be worrying. It started a few weeks back, and it's just getting worse. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. Thank you for being upfront with me. It's alright, we don't need to spend a lot of time on things that aren't important. And no offense taken at all. “Tired” is quite broad, can you tell me more about how you're tired?
PATIENT: Oh, don't patronize me, Doctor. What do you mean how? Just…tired! Like, I could sleep for a week and still feel exhausted. Everything feels like a huge effort. Getting out of bed, making a meal, even just thinking straight. I used to be so active, always gardening and visiting friends. Now…now I just want to sit. And the dirt…it's like, a craving. It doesn’t help, obviously, but I feel…better, momentarily, if that makes any sense. Though, honestly, I don’t even know why I'm telling you this. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across as patronizing, Ms. Hardenburgh. That was not my intention. It's good you're sharing all of this with me; it’s important information, and nothing is ridiculous when it comes to your health. So, this exhaustion has been going on for several weeks, coinciding with this…craving for dirt. And it provides a temporary sense of relief, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, temporary. Don't make me repeat myself. It’s not like it’s a solution, it just…takes the edge off for a bit. And it’s not just any dirt, you know. It has to be…a certain kind. From the garden, mostly. Clay-rich, I think. I don’t know. I’m not a geologist! Look, are you going to ask me a million questions about my childhood now? Because I haven’t got time for that.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, I won’t ask about your childhood unless it becomes relevant. Clay-rich dirt specifically…that is certainly interesting. Let's try to build a clearer picture. Besides the exhaustion and the dirt craving, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling or functioning?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I've been…more short-tempered, I suppose. Snapping at people. And my stomach…it hasn’t been right. Sort of…upset. Not full-blown sick, but just…off. And I keep getting these headaches. Dull aches, mostly, but they’re annoying. Honestly, I just feel…old. Which, I am old, but this is different. It’s like my body is falling apart. Is that helpful? I’m probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, that's very helpful. Short-temperedness, stomach upset, and headaches along with the exhaustion and craving…these are all important pieces of the puzzle. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite…no, not really. I eat when I need to, but I don’t have much of an appetite, no. And swallowing…well, sometimes things feel a bit stuck, but it’s not a constant thing. Like, if I eat something dry. It’s not like I’m choking or anything. I used to have a very strong constitution, never bothered with doctors. This is all so…undignified. Frankly, I suspect it's just my age catching up with me. A bit of wear and tear. Is that what you’ll tell me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's disheartening when our bodies don't cooperate the way they used to. And it's perfectly reasonable to wonder if this is simply a result of aging. However, we need to rule out any underlying causes before attributing it to that. Now, regarding your medical history…have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anemia?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, I’ve lived a good, long life without needing a list of fancy medical terms. I've had the usual aches and pains, a bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, decades. I've always been careful about what I eat, stayed active, and just…looked after myself. This is completely out of character. And I really do wish you’d stop writing things down. It feels…invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Hardenburgh. I apologize if it feels invasive; I assure you, everything is kept strictly confidential. The notes are simply to help me remember all the details and ensure I provide the best possible care. Alright. How about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Goodness, let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, that's about it. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree when I was young. A simple fracture, healed up fine. No major surgeries, no serious illnesses, no long hospital stays. Really, I've been remarkably healthy, all things considered. This whole situation is…baffling. And frankly, a bit frightening. I'm not used to feeling like this. Is there anything you can tell me yet? Some idea of what's going on?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a simple arm fracture – that's good to know. Ms. Hardenburgh, based on what you've told me – the exhaustion, the clay craving, the stomach upset, the headaches, and the occasional difficulty swallowing – and given your age and lack of significant medical history, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. One possibility is iron deficiency anemia, which can cause cravings for unusual substances like dirt—a condition called pica—along with fatigue and other symptoms. Another possibility, although less common, is a condition affecting the esophagus or stomach. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. This will help us check your iron levels, thyroid function, and other important indicators. I’d also like to do a brief physical exam, listening to your heart and lungs and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect any miracles. Honestly, I suspect it’s just my body shutting down. I’m an old woman, Doctor. Things wear out. But…the physical exam…do I have to? I don’t really like being poked and prodded. And please, no unnecessary questions. I’ve already told you everything that’s relevant. Just do the tests and tell me what you find. Quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a garden waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll proceed as efficiently as possible. The physical exam is just a quick assessment—listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and gently feeling your abdomen—to help us gather more information. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. If you’re comfortable, please have a seat here, and we’ll get started. I'll explain everything as we go. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss… I used to be able to run for miles. Now look at me. Just get it over with, Doctor. And try not to take too long. I'm not fond of hospitals, or doctors, or…well, anything like this. Just listen, poke, whatever you need to do, and then tell me the results. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Just relax. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Take a deep breath in…and out…good. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Again, just deep breaths in and out… Your breathing sounds clear, though slightly diminished. Blood pressure is 140/90, a little elevated, but not alarming for your age. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No! Don’t poke so hard. It’s…uncomfortable. Just a dull ache, generally. Nothing specific. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me nervous. Is it something serious? Are you going to send me to a hospital? Because I’m telling you now, I’m not going. I want to go home. To my garden. Just tell me if I need to worry, and then let me leave. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Hardenburgh. I did not mean to cause any discomfort. I was simply trying to assess for any tenderness. It's too early to say definitively whether there is anything to worry about. The blood tests will give us a much clearer picture. I understand your anxiety about going to the hospital, and I assure you, that is not my intention at this point. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing acutely concerning, but it’s something we'll want to investigate further. Now, let's get those blood tests ordered. The nurse will be in shortly to draw them. It will only take a few minutes. Afterwards, you can go home and rest. We'll call you with the results as soon as they come back, usually within a few days. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A few days? Honestly, everything takes forever. Fine. Whatever. Just get the nurse in here and let’s get it over with. I want to go home. And if it’s something serious, Doctor, I’m blaming you. I should have just stayed in my garden. At least there, I know what to expect. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll let the nurse know to come in as quickly as possible. And I assure you, we'll do everything we can to get you answers as soon as possible. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Finally. It’s about time. Honestly, you people… Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day. .
