DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's my ears, you see. Not what they used to be, not by a long shot. Things are… muffled. Like someone put cotton in 'em, maybe? It's been gettin' worse lately, I reckon. Hard to hear the telly sometimes, and folks have to repeat themselves. I don't rightly remember when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Muffled, you say. Right. And is it…both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Both, I think. Yes, both. It's not like one's clear as a bell and the other's not. Just… both kinda fuzzy. It’s hard to tell, really. They both feel… the same. I don’t pay much attention, to be honest. It just gets quieter and quieter.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain at all. Never any pain. Just… quiet. It's more frustrating than anything, you know? Missin' bits of conversation. My daughter, bless her heart, she gets after me for not hearin' her. She says I’m gettin' too old to be listenin' to the radio all the time, anyway. But I like the old tunes!
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you exposed to any loud noises regularly?
PATIENT: Loud noises? Not… really. Well, there's the telly, of course. And sometimes the lawnmower when young Timmy next door is cuttin' his grass. But nothin' too loud, not that I recall. I used to work in a shoe factory, years and years ago, but that wasn’t… particularly noisy. Mostly just the hum of the machines, I think. Now that I think of it, maybe… maybe it was a bit loud. A long time ago, though. I don’t remember much about it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmm. You know, now that you mention it… sometimes. It’s not constant, mind you. Just a sort of… faint whistle. Like a kettle boilin', maybe? I mostly notice it when it's quiet. Like at night, before I go to sleep. I always thought it was just… my head. Old age, again, probably. It's not botherin' me too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me take a look at those ears. Just gonna have a quick peek, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle, won't ya? I don’t like things poked around in my ears, if I’m bein’ honest. It always tickles.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Cerumen impaction in both ears. A fair amount. That's likely contributing to the muffled hearing. And a little bit of… redness. Probably just irritation from the wax. We can get that wax removed. It's a pretty simple procedure.
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Well, that explains somethin', I reckon. I always did have a build-up of wax. My mother used to fuss over it, tryin' to get it out with those little cotton swabs. Never could get it all, though. So, you can get it out? That’d be grand. Will I be able to hear better afterward? That's all I really want, you know. To hear what folks are sayin'.
DOCTOR: We can do a cerumen removal, yes. It involves irrigating the ear canal with water. Relatively painless, but can be a little uncomfortable. We’ll see how much wax there is once we get started. It’s unlikely to be a complete fix, especially given your age, but it should improve things. Do you have any allergies to ear drops or anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had much trouble with allergies, not really. I used to get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that was just hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. No ear drops, no. Never used 'em. My daughter, Carol, she's the one with the allergies. Terrible with pollen, she is. But me? No, nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll order the cerumen removal for tomorrow. The nurse will explain the procedure to you in detail. If it doesn't improve your hearing enough, we can discuss a hearing test. Any other concerns today?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Oh my. That sounds… serious. I don't know, Doctor. I'm not sure I want a test. Just gettin' the wax out sounds alright. I don't want nothin' fancy. No, I think that’s it. Just the wax, if you please. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' at my ears. It's been botherin' me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll start with the wax removal. If that doesn't resolve the issue, we’ll revisit the hearing test. Nurse will be in shortly to give you instructions. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too. I reckon I’ll just wait for the nurse. .
