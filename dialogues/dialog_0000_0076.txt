DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's these bumps on my legs, you see? On my shins, mostly. They're red and kinda sore. Been bothering me for a little while now. Not sure what they are, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "A little while now," you say. Hmm. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… maybe a month or so? It's hard to say exactly, you know? I don't pay too much attention to dates. They just kinda… appeared. Started small, and then got more noticeable. They don’t itch, thankfully, just… ache sometimes. Especially when I’m walking around.
DOCTOR: Right. A month. And are they getting bigger?
PATIENT: Well, I think so. Not fast, you understand. But I remember when they were just little pinpricks, and now… well, now they’re definitely more noticeable. My wife, Elena, she keeps telling me to come get ‘em checked. She worries a lot. She’s a good woman, that Elena.
DOCTOR: Your wife sounds sensible. Alright. Let’s have a look at these bumps. Please, have a seat on the examination table and pull your pants up a bit so I can get a good view of your shins.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sure thing. There they are. You can see ‘em pretty good now, I guess. A little red, aren’t they? Not sure what’s causing ‘em. I work pretty hard, you know, moving things around. Maybe that’s got something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There are multiple erythematous papules and nodules on your anterior shins. They appear to be approximately… 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. Some are tender to palpation. No warmth or drainage noted. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, geez… I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I have it, Doctor. I get checked up at the clinic sometimes, but they don't usually mention anything like that. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly rice and fish, you know? Elena makes sure of it. I do get thirsty a lot, though. Is that… a sign?
DOCTOR: Thirst can be a sign, yes. It's not definitive. And "trying to eat healthy" isn't always enough. Rice is…well, never mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Not really, Doctor. Just tired sometimes, but I’m 71, you know? Gets harder to keep up with everything. No fever, no aches anywhere else… just these bumps and the thirst. And maybe a little more tired than usual. Elena says I’ve been a bit grumpy lately, but she says that every year! She’s a good woman, that Elena.
DOCTOR: Right. Grumpiness. We'll make a note of that. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your legs?
PATIENT: Injuries? No, not that I remember, Doctor. I get a few scrapes here and there, working, you know, but nothing serious. Mostly just little bumps and bruises. I'm careful, mostly. Elena would have my hide if I hurt myself! She worries, that woman. Always has.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s possible these are stasis dermatitis. It's common in people with circulation issues. But we need to rule out other things. I’m going to order a CBC, CMP, and a lipid panel. And we’ll need to check your ankle-brachial index to assess your circulation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a lot of tests, Doctor? I don't really understand all those words. CBC, CMP… is that going to hurt? And what’s an ankle-brachial… whatever that is? I just want these bumps to go away, you know? Is it serious? Elena will be so worried if it’s serious.
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt, Mr. Aluia. It's just blood work and a simple test to check the blood flow in your legs. The blood work will tell us if there's anything else going on. And the ankle-brachial index… it’s a way to see how well the blood is circulating in your legs. It involves a blood pressure cuff, that’s all. I'm ordering these tests to rule out anything serious. Frankly, worrying won't help. We need data. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we can schedule the ankle-brachial index for tomorrow. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Data, you say? Tomorrow’s alright, I guess. Elena can drive me. She likes getting out. But what if it is serious, Doctor? What if it's… bad? I don't want to worry Elena, you know? She's been through a lot. She worries enough already.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I understand your concern, but we can’t jump to conclusions before we have the results. If it is something serious – and I’m not saying it is – we'll discuss treatment options. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please try to relax. Worrying will only elevate your blood pressure, and that won't help with the index test. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I guess not. Just… tell Elena if it's bad, okay? She needs to know. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. .
