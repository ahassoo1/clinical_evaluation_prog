DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, things have been… not quite right, lately. With my memory, you understand. It is… worrying. I hope we can speak quickly. I have many appointments.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. We'll do our best to be efficient. It's perfectly alright to be concerned about memory changes. Many things can cause them, and we’ll work through it together. When you say “not quite right,” can you tell me a little more specifically what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Specifically… it is difficult to explain. I remember… everything. Dates, names, what I ate for breakfast ten years ago… but recently, I forget how to do things. Simple things. Like… where I put my keys, even when I just had them. Or… a word. A common word, when I am speaking. It is… frustrating. And it is new. I do not believe this has happened before.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Alvara. So, it's not a loss of memories themselves, but difficulty recalling how to perform actions or finding the right words. And you’re saying this is a recent development?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. You understand perfectly. Recent. Perhaps… three months? It started… slowly. I thought it was just stress, with the community association meetings. But it is… worsening. And my blood pressure has been… high, the pharmacist says. He mentioned it when I picked up my medication. He said it could be connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of progressively worsening difficulty with performing tasks and finding words, alongside a recent report of high blood pressure from your pharmacist. That's good information. It’s wise of him to mention the connection. Before we get into a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit more about these tasks you're finding difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Cooking, for example. I have cooked the same recipes for… decades. But now, I sometimes forget the order. Or… how much of an ingredient. Very small things. And… locking the door. I check it repeatedly. I know I locked it, but then I worry. And I check again. It is… embarrassing. It is not like me. Also, with the association, I forget names of people I have known for years. I do not mean I do not know them, just… the name escapes me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulties with sequencing steps in familiar tasks like cooking, repetitive checking behaviors, and occasional difficulty retrieving names. These are all important details. Have you noticed any other changes alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I… I have been more tired. Much more tired, than usual. Even after a full night of sleep. And… I am a little more… irritable, perhaps? My neighbor, Mrs. Petrova, asked me a simple question yesterday and I… I was not very kind. I apologized, of course, but it is not like me. I have always been… patient. And… sometimes, I feel a little… confused. Not lost, exactly, just… a little disoriented. Like I am not quite… present. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, that makes perfect sense. Increased fatigue, irritability, and feelings of disorientation are all things we need to consider. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Of course. I… I was very healthy, for many years. No serious illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… but nothing major. My husband… he passed away five years ago. He had… heart problems. I have been taking medication for high blood pressure for… perhaps two years now, as I mentioned. And… arthritis in my hands. It is not terrible, just a little pain sometimes. I do not see a specialist for it. I am not insured, you see. It is… expensive. I see my primary care physician, Doctor Volkov, for check-ups. He is… good, but very busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of childhood illnesses, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in your hands. I understand the financial constraints regarding specialist care. And you see Dr. Volkov as your primary care physician. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine matters?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No surgeries. No hospital stays. I… I have been very lucky, in that regard. I have always been careful. I eat well, I exercise… when I can. I used to swim, but… my arthritis makes it difficult now. I try to walk, but even that is… tiring, lately. It is… frustrating, to not be able to do the things I enjoy. I feel… old. Though, I do not feel old. Just… tired. And forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of surgery or hospitalization. It sounds like you've lived a very healthy lifestyle, despite the arthritis. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family experienced memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had some problems, in her later years. She was… confused sometimes. But we did not… we did not talk about it much. It was… a difficult subject. My father… he was healthy, very healthy. He lived to be 90. My husband’s mother… she also had some… issues. Memory problems, mostly. She was in a home, for the last few years of her life. But it was… a long time ago. We did not have the same… understanding of these things, then. Does that help? It is… not very specific, I am afraid. I do not know much about it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like there’s a family history of memory problems on both sides, although the details are limited. That is still valuable information. Just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not drink. I never have. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But I do not. And I certainly do not smoke. Or… anything else. I have always been… very cautious, about these things. It is… not a good habit. And it is not healthy. I believe in… moderation. Though, I find it difficult to moderate my… worry, lately. But that is… a different problem, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Alvara. And it’s understandable to feel worried given the changes you’ve been experiencing. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the Lisinopril, for my blood pressure. And… sometimes, I take Ibuprofen for my arthritis, when the pain is bad. Just over-the-counter, nothing prescribed. And… occasionally, a Vitamin D supplement, during the winter months. The doctor said it would be good for my bones. But that is all. I do not take any other pills. Or… anything else. I try to keep it simple. It is… easier that way. And less expensive.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of your overall health. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment, which includes checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I would like that, very much. I just… I hope it does not take too long. I have another appointment, this afternoon. And… I am a little tired, as I mentioned. But yes, please. Let us get on with it. I want to know what is happening. And I want to… feel better. If that is possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. We’ll be as efficient as possible. And we'll do our best to figure out what’s going on. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I'll wrap the cuff around it. Okay… your blood pressure is 148 over 85. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll want to monitor that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take some deep breaths.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will try to relax. It is… difficult to relax, when I am worried. But I am trying. My mother always said I was a terrible patient. She was right, I suspect. Is everything alright? It sounds… fast. Or is that just my imagination?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast, as you noticed. That could be due to anxiety, or other factors. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'll tap on your knee with this little hammer. Please keep your leg relaxed. Okay, reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I'd like you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Just a normal pace is fine. I'm just checking your balance and coordination.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Oh! I… I am a little clumsy, today. Perhaps it is my shoes. Or… the floor. I do not usually walk like this. I used to be… very graceful. But that was… a long time ago. Is everything alright? I felt a little… dizzy, just now.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down, Ms. Alvara. That was good. It's alright. You did well. A little dizziness can be common. It could be due to a number of things, including the slightly elevated blood pressure, anxiety, or even just standing up quickly. I noticed a slight unsteadiness in your gait. Nothing alarming, but something we should keep an eye on. Overall, your physical exam is largely normal, but the elevated blood pressure and slight unsteadiness warrant further investigation. Now, to help me get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. I'd also like to order a Vitamin D level to see where that’s at. Finally, I would recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural issues. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Anything that will help me understand what is happening. Blood work… that is fine. An MRI… that sounds… a little frightening. But if you think it is necessary, then yes. Please. I just… I want to feel better. And I want to know what is happening to my memory. It is… unsettling. I am a widow, you see. I have no one to… help me with these things. So, I rely on you. Do what you think is best. And please… hurry. If that is possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly alright to feel anxious about the MRI, but it’s a very safe and helpful test. We’ll get it scheduled as soon as possible. The blood work can be done at the clinic tomorrow morning. I’ll give you a requisition form, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I would like to start you on a low dose of medication to help manage your blood pressure. I'll also recommend some lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress reduction techniques. I also want to stress the importance of keeping a detailed journal of your memory lapses. Note what happened, when it happened, and any potential triggers. This will be helpful when we review the results of the tests. I will also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the test results and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very thorough. A journal… yes, I can do that. I used to keep a diary, when I was younger. It is… a good idea. And the medication… yes, please. Anything that will help. Two weeks… that seems a long time. But I understand. I will keep the journal, and I will take the medication. And I will try to… reduce my stress. Though, that is difficult, with the association meetings. But I will try. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very kind. And… patient. Is there anything else I should know? Or anything I should do before my next appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. Just try to focus on getting some rest, eating healthy, and keeping that journal. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact the clinic immediately. Also, I'd like to rule out any potential medication interactions. Do you have a list of all the supplements you have taken in the past 6 months?
PATIENT: Oh! That is… a good question, Doctor. Let me think… I do not usually take supplements. Just the Vitamin D, during the winter. And… sometimes, I take fish oil, for my arthritis. But only occasionally. I believe I stopped taking it a few months ago. And… oh! My neighbor, Mrs. Petrova, gave me some… herbal tea, last week. She said it was good for my memory. I only drank one cup. It tasted… strange. I do not know what was in it. I will try to find the packaging, if I can. It is… somewhere in the kitchen. I am a little disorganized, I must confess. But I will try. Is that important? The tea, I mean. It was just one cup.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's important to know everything you've taken, even if it was just one cup of tea. Herbal supplements can sometimes interact with medications or have other effects. If you can find the packaging, that would be great, but don’t worry if you can’t. Just try to remember the name if possible. Okay, Ms. Alvara. I think that’s all for today. My nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and give you instructions on how to access the lab requisition form. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m confident that we can get to the bottom of this. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very kind. I appreciate your patience. I will keep the journal. And I will take the medication. And I will try to… feel better. And… thank you again.
