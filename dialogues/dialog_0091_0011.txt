DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Delacour. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need somethin’ signed, somethin’ about… well, about gettin’ some work done. Cosmetic, they called it. I just need a paper sayin’ I’m okay to do it. A lady at the place said I needed clearance from a doctor. Is that what you do here? Sign papers?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. While I can certainly review documentation and provide medical clearance when appropriate, a proper assessment is necessary to ensure your safety and well-being before proceeding with any medical procedure, even cosmetic ones. Could you tell me more about the procedure you are considering?
PATIENT: Assessment? Look, Doctor, I been workin’ with radio towers my whole life. Climb ‘em, fix ‘em, the whole nine yards. I’m a strong man, relatively speakin’. I ain’t need no assessment. Just… a signature. What kinda procedure are you talkin’ about? It’s… for my face. That’s all you need to know. Honestly, I don’t recall the specifics. It was a promotion or somethin’. They said it'd make me look… younger. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your strength and experience, Mr. Honcoop. However, even procedures considered cosmetic carry potential risks, and my professional responsibility requires me to understand those risks in relation to your specific health status. "Younger" can encompass a wide range of treatments. Could you recall the name of the establishment where you are seeking this treatment?
PATIENT: Establishment? Oh, Lord. Now you’re askin’ for trouble. It was… shiny. Real bright lights. Downtown, maybe? Listen, I ain't good with names. They had pamphlets, lots of before-and-after pictures. That’s all I remember. I tell ya, Doctor, this is a waste of my time. I just need a doctor to say I'm fit as a fiddle. Is that so much to ask? It was somethin’ about… tightenin’ things up. My face, I mean. Is that helpin' at all? It was a deal, a special. They were pushin' it hard.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, proceeding without a clear understanding of the procedure, the establishment performing it, and your overall health profile would be irresponsible on my part. Let’s try this: do you recall what part of your face this procedure was intended for?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. You’re makin’ me think too hard. It was… the jowls, I think. That’s what the lady said. Somethin’ about tightenin’ the jowls and… and the neck, maybe? It was a package deal, remember? A whole face lift, practically. Look, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I climb towers, I fix things. I don’t know nothin’ about procedures or jowls or packages. I just want to look… presentable. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I'm startin’ to regret comin’ here. This is goin’ nowhere.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate you clarifying that. A lower face and neck lift does involve surgical procedures, and it's crucial to assess your medical history to ensure you're a suitable candidate. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Now you’re testin’ me. Look, I told you, I climb towers! That keeps a man in shape. I’m as healthy as a horse, relatively speakin’. I get a little winded sometimes, maybe, but that’s just from the climbin’. Never been to a doctor in my life, ‘cept for maybe a broken arm when I was a kid. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no… whatever else you mentioned. Just a simple man, Doctor. A simple, tower-climbin’ man. Is that good enough for you? I ain’t got time for a whole medical exam. I got work to do. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, stating you are "healthy as a horse" is not a substitute for a medical evaluation. A face and neck lift, like any surgery, carries risks – infection, bleeding, nerve damage – and these risks are amplified if underlying medical conditions exist that you are unaware of. Given your reluctance to provide any medical history, and the potential seriousness of this procedure, I am unable to provide medical clearance at this time. Furthermore, I strongly recommend you consult with a primary care physician for a comprehensive health assessment before proceeding with any surgical intervention. I understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for, but my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. Do you have any questions about this?
