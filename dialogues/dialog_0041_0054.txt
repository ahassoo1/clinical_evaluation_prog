DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. I… cough a lot. Been coughin’ for a long time. And I feel tired all the time, yeah. Also, my nose… gets blocked up a lot. Like, sinus, you know? Hurts sometimes. I dunno... it just keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, tiredness, and a stuffy, sometimes painful nose. That gives us a starting point. When you say “a long time,” could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… Maybe… six months? Or maybe longer. It’s hard to remember exactly. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. Feels worse when it rains, maybe? I work outside a lot, changing tires... so maybe that has somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer, comes and goes, worse in the rain… and you work outdoors changing tires. That’s helpful. Does the cough bring anything up when you cough—like mucus or phlegm?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. White stuff. Not… not much, usually. But when it’s bad, yeah. White, and kinda sticky. Sorry. It’s not… a nice thing to talk about. Sometimes a little bit of blood too, but not much. Just… a spot. Happens when I cough really hard. Should I be worried about that?
DOCTOR: Okay, white, sticky mucus, and occasionally a spot of blood with hard coughing. It's good you mentioned the blood—we definitely want to look into that. Don’t apologize, it’s important information. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like, shivering cold warm. No chills, no… night sweats. I sleep okay, usually. Just… tired when I wake up. Like I didn't sleep enough. Is that… normal? I dunno much about fevers and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats, just general tiredness. Let's talk about your past health a bit, if you don't mind. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything before?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… hmm. Not really. When I was little, I had the chickenpox, I think. And I broke my arm once, playin’ football. But… nothing bad. Nothing I needed to stay in the hospital for. My wife says I had some kinda… lung infection a long time ago, when I first came to Malaysia, but I don't really remember. She tells me everything. I was sick for a long time, but I don’t recall much.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, a broken arm, and a possible lung infection when you first came to Malaysia that your wife mentioned. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything! My wife, she's allergic to peanuts, but not me. No, I don't think so. I can take… Panadol, right? When I got headache, I take Panadol and okay. I don't remember bein' allergic to nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you've taken Panadol without issue. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things, regularly?
PATIENT: No, no medicines. Just… Panadol when my head hurts. Sometimes I take some… what you call… herbal stuff, from the shop. For cough, but it doesn't really help much. Just make the cough… taste better, maybe? My mother-in-law gives it to me. She thinks it's good. But I don't think it’s doin’ much, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional Panadol and some herbal remedies from a shop. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members—parents, siblings—have any health problems, like asthma, allergies, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had some problems with her chest, when she was old. Cough a lot, like me. Not sure what it was. My father… he was okay. Strong man. My sister… she’s got high blood pressure, I think. She takes tablets for it. But… not lungs. Not that I remember, anyway. My wife's family… her mother coughs a lot too, actually. Always has. But just an old woman cough, you know? Like a normal thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother and wife's mother both had coughs, and your sister has high blood pressure. Last question for the history part: do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never. My wife, she used to smoke, a long time ago, when she was young. But she stopped. A long time ago. I don't like smoke. Makes me cough even more. No, never smoked, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Rayshon. That gives me a pretty good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your nose and throat, and take your temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my nose, yeah? It's a little sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will. First, I'm just going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay… and again. Hmm. I can hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. That suggests some narrowing of your airways. Now I'll just take a look at your nose and throat. Your nasal passages are a bit swollen and red. There’s some mucus present. Your throat looks a little irritated, but no obvious signs of infection. Your temperature is normal, 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. Tell me if anything feels painful. How about here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that hurts a little. Right there, on my right side. The other side is okay. Not so bad. Feels… stuffy, but not painful until you push on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on your right sinus. That, combined with the wheezing, nasal swelling, and your history of cough and fatigue, suggests a few possibilities. It could be a sinus infection, bronchitis, or possibly even asthma, although the lack of a previous diagnosis makes asthma less likely without further testing. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia and get a better look at your lungs. I'll also order a complete blood count to see if there's any sign of infection. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood test… Is it… serious? What if it is serious? I don't… I don't have much money, Doctor. And my insurance… I don't have any. I just want to feel better. Is the X-ray expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Rayshon. It's good you're asking. The X-ray and blood test aren’t necessarily because I think it’s serious in a life-threatening way, but we need to get a better idea of what’s going on so we can treat it properly. They're diagnostic tools—they help us figure out the cause of your symptoms. As for the cost, I know you don’t have insurance, and that can be a big worry. Let me see what the approximate costs are for the X-ray and blood work at this clinic. … Okay, the X-ray will be about $150, and the blood work around $80. This clinic does have a financial assistance program for patients without insurance. Let me get you the information about that and we can discuss payment options. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a nasal saline spray to help with the congestion and a cough suppressant to make you more comfortable. That won’t solve the problem, but it will help you feel a little better while we wait for the test results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… $150 and $80… That's… a lot. But… okay. If there's a help program, yeah, I’ll try that. And the spray and the… cough medicine, yeah, that sounds good. Anything to help me sleep. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? And get back to work. I gotta make money.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I understand. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll write you a prescription for the nasal saline spray and cough suppressant. The pharmacy is just down the hall. I’m going to give you a note explaining the situation for the financial assistance program. Just take that along with your ID when you apply. The lab is next door, and I'll send the order for the blood work over electronically. They'll call you when they're ready. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to discuss the results of the X-ray and blood work. How does next Thursday at 2 pm sound?
PATIENT: Thursday at 2pm… yeah, that’s okay. I can probably get someone to cover for me at work. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I hope it’s nothin’ too bad. I gotta go now, I think. Work callin’. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. Get well soon. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
