DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brendan. Well, it's this itching, really. It’s… everywhere, pretty much. Not like a rash, just… a constant itch. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to be getting any better, and sometimes it feels worse at night.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four weeks, I think. Maybe a little longer? It started gradually, and I thought it was just dry skin at first, you know? But lotion doesn’t help, and it’s not just dry patches. It's all over – arms, legs, back… even my stomach. It’s hard to explain. It's not raised or bumpy, just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has anything changed recently, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… Not really, not that I can recall. Same routine, same foods… Oh! Well, my wife, bless her, passed away about six months ago. That was a big change, obviously, but… I don’t know if that would cause itching? I’ve been trying to keep busy, gardening mostly. Maybe stress? It’s been…a difficult time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Significant life events can certainly manifest physically. And gardening… are you using any new fertilizers or pesticides, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a thought! Yes, actually. Old Man Hemlock at the hardware store convinced me to try this new “Miracle Grow” stuff. Said it’ll make my tomatoes the biggest they’ve ever been. I used it a couple of weeks ago, right around when the itching really started getting bad. I’ve never used anything like it before. It smelled…stronger than the usual stuff, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, let’s do a quick examination. I’d like to take a look at your skin and perhaps rule out other possibilities. Could you please remove your shirt and trousers so I can get a better look?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Um, I suppose so. Is there a gown or something? I didn’t… I didn’t really prepare for a full examination. Just thought we’d talk about it. I just hope it is that Miracle Grow stuff. It’d be embarrassing if it was something else.
DOCTOR: There is a gown, yes. Please, take your time. And don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. I’ll step out while you change, and I’ll return shortly.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. This is…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. If you would just stand here and let me take a look. I’m not seeing any obvious rash or lesions. The skin appears… normal in color and texture. However, there is some mild dryness, especially on your back and legs. Do you experience any burning or tingling sensation in addition to the itch?
PATIENT: No burning, thankfully. Just the itch. It’s…constant, but it comes and goes in intensity. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s driving me crazy. It doesn't really seem to be worse in any specific spot, it just kind of…moves around. And it’s worse at night, definitely. I wake up scratching sometimes without even realizing it. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your laundry detergent, soap, or any other topical products you’ve been using recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I've been using the same things for years. Old Spice soap, Tide detergent… the usual. My wife always did the laundry, but since… well, I took over, and I haven’t changed a thing. I figured if it wasn't broke, don't fix it, you know? I really thought it was that Miracle Grow. It just seemed…too coincidental. But if it’s not that, I have no idea what it could be. It's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Given your history and the examination findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause at this time. The possibility of a contact dermatitis – an allergic reaction to something you’ve been exposed to – is still present, despite your consistent product use. However, we must also consider other possibilities, such as dry skin exacerbated by the change in seasons, or even a more systemic cause. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues that may be contributing to the itching. I will also prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream – a mild one – to help alleviate the itching in the meantime. We can re-evaluate the situation after we receive the lab results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I mean, I trust your judgment, Doctor. Blood tests… I haven't had those done in years. But if it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m all for it. And the cream… anything to stop the itching, honestly. It’s just… frustrating. It's like a constant annoyance. So, where do I go to get the blood work done? And how long do you think it will take to get the results? I don’t need anything fancy, just…to get back to a normal life, you know? Gardening without wanting to tear my skin off.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ferneding. I understand your frustration. We'll get to the bottom of this. You can go to the lab here at the clinic, just down the hall. They’re open until 5 PM today. I’ll send the order electronically, so just tell them your name and date of birth. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, apply the corticosteroid cream sparingly to the affected areas twice a day. If the itching worsens significantly or you develop any other symptoms – such as fever, fatigue, or changes in your skin – please contact the clinic immediately. We can also discuss a referral to a dermatologist if the situation doesn’t improve after a week. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. The lab down the hall… that’s good, easy enough. And the cream…twice a day. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, just knowing we’re trying to figure it out. I appreciate your patience. I guess I'll go get this blood work done. And hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And I hope you find some relief soon. .
