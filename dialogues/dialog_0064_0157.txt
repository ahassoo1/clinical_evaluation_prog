DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good that you’re feeling well, that’s always a positive. But sometimes high blood pressure doesn’t have obvious symptoms, which is why it's important to check it, even if you feel perfectly fine. The nurse mentioned high blood pressure… do you recall when she took your reading, and what the numbers were, if she told you?
PATIENT: Something like… 140 over 90? Maybe 150 over… I don’t know, honestly. Numbers aren't really my thing. She just said it was “high” and I needed to see you. It felt like a waste of a perfectly good Saturday, if you want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. It's never fun to have your weekend disrupted. And you’re right, numbers can be confusing. The nurse’s notes confirm readings around 148/92 and 152/96. Those are a bit elevated. Now, to get a better understanding of things, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this something new?
PATIENT: No! Never. This is… brand new. I’ve always been healthy. My momma always said I had good genes. She lived to be ninety-something, never had a problem. This is probably just a machine error. Or maybe the nurse was new. I don’t know. I just want to make sure it’s not something serious and then I can go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – no previous diagnosis. And it's certainly possible there was a slight error with the reading. It's always best to confirm things. We'll do that now. Before we recheck, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I work. I come home. I eat dinner with my husband. We watch TV. It's not exactly complicated. I don't have time for fancy hobbies.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound complicated at all! I just mean things like what kind of work do you do, roughly how much physical activity you get in a typical week, and what a typical diet looks like for you. And do you use any tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?
PATIENT: I told you, I work. I'm a civil engineering tech. Mostly paperwork, some site visits. Not much walking, if that’s what you’re getting at. Dinner is usually… meat and potatoes, or something. Sometimes pasta. My husband does most of the cooking. And no, none of that other stuff. I don't need it. I have enough stress at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, primarily desk work, standard American diet, and no tobacco, alcohol or recreational drugs. And you mentioned stress at work. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, there’s deadlines, you know? And people constantly changing their minds about things. And the boss breathing down your neck. It's a lot of responsibility, making sure everything is right. And people always complaining. It never ends. Honestly, it's exhausting. It's not like I want things to fall apart, but everyone acts like it’s my fault when they do.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly stressful, Tasmia. It’s understandable that would take a toll. Stress can absolutely contribute to blood pressure fluctuations. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, just to confirm the readings. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what the next steps are, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry it up, okay? I have laundry to do. And my husband is making his famous chili tonight, and I don't want to miss that. It’s a complicated recipe.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Good. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra noises. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 146/94 in the right arm, and 144/92 in the left arm. Pulse is 78 and regular. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything seems… normal, aside from the elevated blood pressure. Which, of course, is why we’re here.
PATIENT: See? Everything is normal! I told you. It's probably just a fluke. Can I go now? I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. And I appreciate you sharing that. However, consistently elevated blood pressure, even if you don't feel any symptoms, does require further investigation. While the physical exam was normal, these readings are concerning enough that we need to rule out any underlying causes. Now, I’m not saying there’s definitely something wrong, but it’s best to be cautious. I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other potential issues. I'd also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An EKG? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine! You're trying to scare me for no reason. My momma never needed any of this fancy stuff, and she lived to be ninety-something. I don't want any tests. I just want to go home. I’m not paying for all this nonsense. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Tasmia. I truly do. And I respect your wishes. However, while your mother’s longevity is wonderful, everyone is different. Medical practices have also evolved over time. I’m not trying to scare you, but ignoring consistently elevated blood pressure can lead to serious health problems down the road—heart disease, stroke, kidney failure. The blood tests and EKG are a simple precaution, and can give us peace of mind. They will help us determine if any treatment is necessary. If we don't investigate, and something is going on, it could potentially be more difficult to manage later on. Would you be open to at least considering the blood tests?
