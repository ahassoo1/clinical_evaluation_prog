DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the paper says. Honestly, I don’t really do doctors. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it's good of your husband to be proactive about your health. High blood pressure is something we want to address, even if you feel fine. It often doesn't have symptoms, which is why it’s important to check it regularly. Now, the paper simply states “high blood pressure.” Can you tell me a little more about when you found out about it?
PATIENT: Found out? At a work thing, I think. They had one of those little health booths. The lady took my blood pressure and said it was…high. Didn’t feel any different, and frankly, I was busy. They kept telling me to follow up, but…life.
DOCTOR: Yes, those health fairs can be…inconvenient. Alright. And has anyone – a doctor, perhaps – actually diagnosed you with hypertension, or was it just the single reading at the fair?
PATIENT: No. Not a real doctor. Just that lady with the machine. My husband kept nagging me about it, so I finally scheduled something to get him off my back. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. I eat normal, exercise when I can…it’s probably just stress, if anything. He worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A single elevated reading isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s still prudent to investigate, especially given your family history – if any. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: My grandma on my mom’s side… she had something. I think it was a heart thing. She was…old, though. And she didn’t take care of herself. Smoked like a chimney, ate nothing but frybread. Not really the same, is it? I'm not like that.
DOCTOR: It's true that lifestyle factors play a significant role. However, there is still a genetic component. Alright. Let’s get some baseline information. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your heart, lungs, and taking your blood pressure again, of course. And we’ll need to do some blood work to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But I swear, if this is just a waste of time... My husband will never let me hear the end of it. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat and relax your arm. 148 over 92…and your pulse is 84. A bit elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... Sounds are normal, no murmurs or wheezing. Everything sounds clear. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No. None of that. I work outside a lot. Sometimes I get tired, obviously, but that’s just…work. And the heat. It's been a hot summer. Don't tell me I have to change my job over this.
DOCTOR: Certainly not. We are simply gathering information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a problem. Not even with bee stings. I'm pretty tough. Though, I don't go looking for trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. When I remember. My husband buys them, says it’s good for me. Honestly, I forget half the time. He gets upset if I don't. It's easier to just take it.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a little more. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Work. Mostly. I'm a technician – out in the field, checking…stuff. Water lines, mostly. It’s hot, dirty work. I’m on my feet all day. Then I come home, make dinner, watch TV. Normal stuff. It’s not glamorous. And I really don’t have time for hobbies or anything like that.
DOCTOR: And how would you describe your diet?
PATIENT: Look, I eat. I’m not one of those people who’s constantly watching what I eat. I like a good burger, sometimes I have frybread if my aunt makes it, but mostly just…normal food. I try to have a salad sometimes, but honestly, it’s just not that satisfying. My husband tries to get me to eat healthier, but it’s hard. I work long hours, I’m tired. I don’t have time for fancy cooking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, one last question for now. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve seen what that does to people. My grandma...like I said. And my husband wouldn’t allow it, anyway. He’s very…particular about things like that. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Very rarely.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and your elevated blood pressure reading, we need to investigate this further. It's good you don't smoke and rarely drink. The lack of a significant lifestyle change is...concerning, but not insurmountable. We’ll start with some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid panel – just to rule out any underlying issues. I’m also going to order a 24-hour urine collection to check your kidney function. We’ll also need to repeat your blood pressure measurement on a separate day, ideally at different times, to get a more accurate reading. I'll give you instructions for home monitoring, if you're willing. This will give us a better idea of how your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. More running around. Honestly, this is ridiculous. My husband is going to be so pleased. Fine. I’ll do the tests, but I’m not promising anything. And home monitoring? Seriously? I barely have time to sleep. I don’t need more things to worry about. I guess… just tell me where to go for the blood work and where to pick up the containers for the urine thing. And make it quick, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You don't need an appointment. As for the 24-hour urine collection, the nurse will provide you with the containers and detailed instructions. It requires collecting all your urine for 24 hours, so you’ll need to start first thing in the morning. The nurse’s station is just outside my door if you have any questions. I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you before you leave. I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, but this is important. Ignoring high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No. No other concerns. Just...get this over with. And tell my husband it’s probably nothing. He’ll worry himself sick if I don’t. Fine. I’ll go do the tests. Thanks, I guess.
