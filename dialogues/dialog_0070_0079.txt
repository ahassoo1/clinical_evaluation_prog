DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Um, it’s about my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I’m taking the blood thinner like I'm supposed to. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. Bruising that worsens despite being on a blood thinner is something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? Little bumps, you know, from just knocking into things. But now... even a gentle touch leaves a mark. Like, yesterday I barely brushed against the doorframe and I got a bruise on my arm. It’s… frustrating. And it’s not just my arms, it's showing up on my legs too now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds quite concerning, Courtnye. Bruising with minimal trauma is definitely something we want to explore further. You mentioned it started about a month ago and is now more widespread. Is the bruising painful?
PATIENT: Not really painful, no. It’s more… tender, if I press on it. Not like a bad ache or anything. It’s just… visible. Lots of it. And it feels like it shows up so easily now. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand why that would be concerning and embarrassing, Courtnye. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what might be happening. You mentioned being on a blood thinner. May I ask what blood thinner you are taking and what it’s for?
PATIENT: Oh, um, it’s… Warfarin. The doctor prescribed it after I had a blood clot in my leg last year. It was pretty bad, they said I needed to be on it for a while, to prevent another one. I try to take it exactly as prescribed, I really do.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Courtnye. It's good you are diligent about taking your medication. Given your history of a blood clot and being on Warfarin, unexplained bruising is something we need to evaluate carefully. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me about any other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a multivitamin, pretty standard. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I'll take ibuprofen. Just the regular stuff you get at the pharmacy. Oh! And sometimes I take ginger for nausea, but not often. That's it, I think. Honestly, not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and ginger occasionally. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising – things like fatigue, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, or any unusual bleeding from other areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been a little tired, maybe, but honestly, who isn’t? It’s been hot, and I’ve been doing a bit more in the garden than usual. But no bleeding anywhere, no nosebleeds, nothing like that. Just the bruising. It’s just… a lot more than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or changes in your diet?
PATIENT: No illnesses, no. Diet’s been pretty normal. Lots of fruit, trying to eat healthy. Nothing major changed there either. I did start drinking more water lately, because of the heat, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Given your history of a blood clot, being on Warfarin, and the recent increase in bruising without any other significant symptoms, I'd like to do a quick physical examination and then order some blood tests. The blood tests will help us assess your current INR level – that’s how we monitor Warfarin – and also check for other potential causes of the bruising. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. The tests sound fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently examine your skin, particularly where you’ve been experiencing the bruising. I'll also check your lymph nodes. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Let me know if I need to adjust anything. It’s a little cold, but I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally, Courtnye. I'm listening to your heart now... everything sounds regular. Deep breath in... and out... good. Lungs sound clear as well. I'm just checking your lymph nodes now... they feel normal, no swelling or tenderness. I see the bruising on your arms and legs. It does appear more widespread than you might expect. I don’t feel any masses or unusual lumps. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. Now we'll proceed with the blood tests. I'm going to write the order for the lab technician.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I hope they don’t take too much blood! I'm not a huge fan of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Courtnye. We'll only take what's necessary. The tests we're ordering are a complete blood count, a coagulation panel , and a basic metabolic panel. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – is very skilled and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. Here’s the requisition form. Please take this to the lab – it's just down the hall to your left. They'll let you know when your results are available, usually within a couple of days. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A couple of days is fine. Down the hall to the left, got it. Thank you for everything, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to look at this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I'm glad I could help. While you're waiting for the results, please continue taking your Warfarin as prescribed and avoid any activities that could cause injury. If you experience any significant bleeding – such as nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or unusually heavy periods – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's a pamphlet with some helpful information about Warfarin and potential side effects. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you in a few days, Courtnye. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you so much, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too.
