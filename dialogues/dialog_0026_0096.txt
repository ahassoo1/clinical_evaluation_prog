DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this light, you see. It’s been bothering me something awful lately. Feels like my eyes are extra sensitive. It's been happening for a couple of months now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months of increased light sensitivity… I see. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not pain, exactly. More like… everything’s just too bright. Even on a cloudy day, the sun feels really harsh. And inside, like with the fluorescent lights in the shops… it makes my eyes ache and I have to squint a lot. It’s getting harder to read, too. Makes me a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Arbin. That sounds quite bothersome. Squinting and difficulty reading are definitely things we need to look into. When did you first notice this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started gradually, I guess. Around… April, maybe? It was after a really bad flu, actually. I was pretty sick for a week or so, high fever, the works. Once I started feeling better, I just noticed things seemed… brighter. Brighter than usual, anyway. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured it was just me getting used to being back on my feet, but it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: April, following a bout of the flu… that's helpful information. Did you have any vision changes during the flu itself—blurriness, double vision, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit. Everything was kind of blurry when I had the fever, but I figured it was just from being unwell and not sleeping properly. It went away when the fever broke, I thought. I didn’t really connect it to this light sensitivity problem until you asked. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just… not as sharp as usual for a day or two.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision during the flu, resolving as you recovered. Good to know. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sensitivity—headaches, eye pain, dryness, any floaters or flashes in your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my eyes feel a little dry, especially at the end of the day. I work with people all day, so I'm looking at screens and charts a lot. I usually just blink a bit more and it gets better. No headaches, no pain, and I haven’t seen any floaters or flashes, thankfully. It's mostly just the brightness, and the dryness sometimes. Oh, and I get tired eyes really quick now. Like, much quicker than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, dryness, fatigue, and the sensitivity… I see. Let's talk a little about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Nothing major. I had the flu a few times, like everyone, and a bad sprained ankle a few years back, but that’s about it. My wife… she passed away a couple years ago, and she had high blood pressure, but that was her, not me. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well and get enough sleep when I can. I take some vitamins, a general multivitamin, that’s all. Do you want to know the brand? I can tell you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Arbin. And I'm very sorry for your loss. No, the brand of the multivitamin isn't necessary at this time, but thank you for offering. Has anything changed with your medications lately?
PATIENT: No, nothing’s changed at all. It’s just the vitamins, same as always. I haven’t been on any prescription medication since… well, never, really. I’ve always been lucky enough to stay healthy, as I said. I was hoping to keep it that way! This eye thing is worrying me, because I depend on my eyes for my job, you know? It's important I can see clearly. It's a bit scary, thinking something might be wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Arbin. It's good you’re proactive about getting this checked out. And it's certainly good you haven't had to rely on prescription medication. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. My mum, she had… cataracts, I think it was, when she got older. She had surgery for them, and it seemed to help her a lot. My dad was pretty healthy, but his eyesight wasn’t great towards the end. He wore glasses, but didn’t have any major problems. As far as I know, no one else in the family had any eye issues, no glaucoma or anything like that. It’s mostly just normal age-related stuff, I think. Though, my mum’s sister… she had diabetes, and I think that affected her eyesight a bit. But she didn’t live very long.
DOCTOR: Okay, cataracts in your mother, some vision issues in your father, and diabetes in an aunt… that’s helpful information. Now, just to finish up the history, can you tell me about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Hmm. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, once or twice a week. Nothing heavy. I don’t go out partying or anything like that. I mostly just relax at home after work, read a book or watch TV. I used to play football when I was younger, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I spend most of my day indoors, at work, and then at home. Is that what you meant? I hope I’m giving you the right information.
DOCTOR: Yes, Arbin, that’s exactly the kind of information I needed. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your vision, look at the structures of your eyes, and assess your pupils. It shouldn't take too long. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, yes, that sounds good. No problem at all. Allergies… let me think. I used to be allergic to cats when I was a kid, but I haven’t been around cats in years. Now that I think about it, I sometimes get itchy eyes when there’s pollen around, especially in the spring, but it’s not a bad allergy, just a bit of irritation. Nothing I take medication for, just try to avoid being outside too much when it’s really bad. I don't have any medication allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, pollen allergy, no medication allergies. That's good to know. Alright, let's get started. Could you please sit up straight and look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Okay, will do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin, I'm going to check your visual acuity now. Could you read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Um… E… F… P… T… Let me see… is that right? I’m having trouble seeing some of them clearly. They’re a bit blurry, especially the smaller ones. Is that what you want me to tell you? I’m sorry, I know I should be able to read these better.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Arbin. It’s helpful for me to know. It seems your vision is slightly reduced. Now, I’m going to check how well your eyes work together. Could you follow my finger as I move it back and forth?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. I'm following it… is it okay? It feels a bit… strange. Like I'm straining to keep my eyes on it. My eyes feel tired already. It's probably just me being nervous, though. I’m really hoping there’s nothing serious wrong.
DOCTOR: I noticed a slight hesitancy, and you are correct to mention the strain. Now, I will use a light to examine the front of your eyes. I will be getting close to your eyes. Please let me know if it's uncomfortable at any point. Everything appears normal on the external exam, no clouding of the lens or signs of infection. Now, I’m going to look at the back of your eyes, which will allow me to view the retina and optic nerve.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. I'll try to stay still. It's a bit bright, but not too bad. Everything feels a bit… odd, looking into that bright light. My eyes are getting tired, but I’m doing my best to keep them open and focused. I hope you can see something useful back there. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. Everything looks relatively normal in the back of your eyes as well. The optic nerves appear healthy, and there’s no evidence of any significant swelling or damage. The blood vessels are clear. Based on this brief examination, Arbin, I don’t see any immediate cause for serious concern. However, your decreased visual acuity and eye strain are things we need to investigate further. Given your history of a recent flu and the symptoms you’ve described, I suspect you may be experiencing post-viral inflammation affecting your eyes. It's also possible you have a mild refractive error that needs correction, or the early stages of dry eye syndrome. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a comprehensive eye exam with an optometrist or ophthalmologist. They can perform more detailed tests to assess your vision, measure your refractive error, and check for any underlying conditions. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: That sounds… reassuring, that it’s probably not something serious. Post-viral inflammation… I can live with that, I think. Yes, please, a referral would be wonderful. I’d feel a lot better knowing someone is taking a closer look, and that we’re covering all the bases. I’m happy to go along with whatever tests they recommend. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to check me out, and for explaining everything so clearly. It's a weight off my shoulders, honestly. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I'm happy to provide a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-rated optometrist just a few blocks from here. I'll also include a note outlining your symptoms and my findings. Here’s the referral information. She has good availability next week, so I recommend calling as soon as possible to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
