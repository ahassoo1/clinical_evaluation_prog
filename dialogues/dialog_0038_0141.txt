DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible, but…constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itching for a couple of weeks. That is frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like, a rash or anything. My skin just…feels itchy. All over. Arms, legs, back…even my scalp. It doesn’t look different, which is…odd, I guess. And it doesn't seem to be getting worse, just…always there. I tried some lotion, regular moisturizer, but that didn’t really help much. It’s…hard to describe. Just a general, nagging itch.
DOCTOR: Right, so no visible rash, just the sensation of itching all over, and moisturizer hasn't provided relief. That helps narrow things down. When you say "all over," is it symmetrical – does it feel the same on both arms, both legs, etc.?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Let me think… Yes, I think so. Pretty much symmetrical, yeah. Both arms feel about the same, both legs…back feels the same on both sides too. It’s not like one side is worse than the other, thankfully. It started…I’d say around the 20th of July, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but around then.
DOCTOR: Okay, symmetrical itching starting around July 20th. And you haven't noticed anything that makes it worse – certain fabrics, foods, soaps, detergents, or activities?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't changed anything in my routine, not that I can think of. Same laundry detergent, same soaps… I eat pretty much the same things. Maybe a little more time outside gardening this summer, but I haven’t noticed it getting worse after being in the garden specifically. It just…is. I’m starting to feel a little silly even talking about it, honestly. It’s just an itch! But it’s relentless.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Brendan. Relentless itching can be really bothersome, even if there’s no visible sign. We need to figure out what’s going on. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Let me see… Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for about ten years now. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Oh, and…my wife, God rest her soul, she passed away five years ago from…well, it was a long illness. That’s about it, really. No allergies that I know of, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. I'm on Medicare now, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, pneumonia in the past, and no known allergies or surgeries. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. And you mentioned your wife; I’m very sorry for your loss. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And… that’s it. Just the Lisinopril. I take it every morning with breakfast. I haven’t changed the dosage recently, and I’ve been taking it regularly for years. I don’t take any over-the-counter medications regularly, just the occasional pain reliever if I have a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. That’s good to know. Sometimes medications can have side effects, even after years of use, so it’s important to check. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any skin conditions, or history of allergies, in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a tough one. My mother had… eczema, I think? When she was a child, but she didn't have it as an adult. My father was pretty healthy, no allergies that I know of. And my wife’s side… I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. They lived in Russia, and things weren’t always…well, documented, you know? So, not much help there, I’m afraid. Mostly healthy people, as far as I know. But eczema on my mother’s side when she was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, eczema on your mother’s side as a child. That’s useful to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, I live alone now, as I said, my wife passed. I retired about eight years ago, I used to be a dispatcher – not police or ambulance, just regular dispatch. I keep pretty busy with gardening, mostly. And I visit my daughter and grandkids a couple of times a month. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t been drinking much lately. Just trying to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Brendan. Keeping busy is important. And no smoking is excellent. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It’s just a routine check, but it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I’m used to doctors poking around a bit, nothing surprises me anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan. Everything sounds and looks good. Your heart and lungs are clear, and your blood pressure is well-controlled. As I suspected, there’s no visible rash or any other obvious skin abnormalities. Your skin feels normal to the touch. This makes it a little trickier to pinpoint the cause of your itching. Given your history and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It could be a mild allergic reaction to something you're not aware of, dry skin despite using moisturizer, or even a side effect of the Lisinopril, although that's less common. It could also be something called pruritus, which is just itching with no obvious cause. I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver and kidney function, and thyroid levels. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough. Blood tests, okay. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You explained everything very clearly. So, just to be clear, you're not sure it’s the Lisinopril, just want to rule it out? That’s good to know. I’d rather be safe than sorry. And what happens after the blood tests? Will I need to come back for another visit?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Brendan. I'm not saying it is the Lisinopril, but it's a possibility we need to investigate, especially given you've been on it for a long time. It's always best to rule out the common things first. After the blood tests, we'll review the results, which usually takes about a week. I'll call you with the findings and discuss the next steps. If the results are normal, we can consider other possibilities, such as allergies or referral to a dermatologist. If something is abnormal, we'll discuss treatment options. I'll give you a lab requisition now. You can go to any lab that accepts Medicare. They'll need your insurance information and a photo ID. Do you have any questions about getting the blood tests done?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Lab requisition, Medicare, photo ID… sounds straightforward enough. I know where the lab is, just down the street. I’ll get it done as soon as I can. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not just dismiss it as “just an itch.”
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. It's important to me that my patients feel heard, and I take even seemingly minor concerns seriously. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Here's the lab requisition. Get it done whenever you're comfortable, and we'll talk soon. Have a good day, and I hope you find some relief from the itching in the meantime.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. I will. And…I will let you know if it gets worse. Just in case.
