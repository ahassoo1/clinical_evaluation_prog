DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s…different than usual. I can’t really describe it, just that it’s not me. I always smell…clean, you know? Now, it’s just…off.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Purtee, there's absolutely no need to be embarrassed. Changes in body odor can be concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. It's smart to get it checked out. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. Around the second week of July, I’d say. It wasn’t sudden, more like I slowly realized things weren’t right. I usually notice right away if something smells off on my clothes after work, but this was different. It’s…hard to pinpoint, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, roughly the second week of July. And you said it wasn’t a sudden change, but a gradual one. Has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago, so things have been… less stressful, actually. That’s a positive change! Work hasn't changed much, same routine. I started taking a new vitamin, a multivitamin with extra B vitamins, maybe a month or so ago? Could that have something to do with it? I don’t know much about vitamins, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a finalized divorce six months ago – that's significant, and less stress is certainly good. And you started a new multivitamin with extra B vitamins about a month ago. We'll definitely note that. Do you notice the change in odor all the time, or is it worse with activity, or at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: It seems to be…more noticeable after work, definitely. I do pretty physical labor, you know, laying floors. Lots of bending and sweating. But even after a shower, it lingers a little. It’s not bad, exactly, just…different. Not my usual clean smell. And I think it's a bit worse at the end of the day, when I'm tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse with activity and at the end of the day when you're tired. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any sweating more than usual?
PATIENT: No, not really. The amount of sweat is about the same, I think. It’s just…the smell is different. I don’t feel sweatier, if that makes sense. It's not like I’m dripping or anything. It's more…a persistent odor, even after I’ve washed. And it's not really localized, it's all over, I guess. Not just my armpits or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, not increased sweating, just the change in odor, and it seems to be generalized. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really. I’ve been trying to eat healthier, more vegetables, less fried food, but that’s been going on for a while now, maybe a couple of months. Nothing new specifically in the last three weeks, I don't think. I do drink a lot of water, always have. I'm not much for sweets, so that hasn’t changed either.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent diet, no changes there. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for about five years now. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I have Medicare, so they keep a good track of things. I don’t see any specialists regularly, just my primary care doctor for checkups. No allergies, either. I've always been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension for five years, no allergies, and no regular specialist visits. That's good to know. And you're currently taking medication for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I take 20 milligrams every morning. I’ve been on the same dose for years now. It’s pretty routine. And I haven't started any other medications recently, just that one. Oh, and the multivitamin, but that’s not a medication, right?
DOCTOR: Right, Lisinopril 20mg daily, and the multivitamin. We'll keep both noted. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother had diabetes, type 2, but she managed it pretty well with diet and exercise. My father had high blood pressure, like me. And my grandmother on my mother’s side had…arthritis, I think. But nothing else really stands out. We don't have a long history of serious illness, really. I'm Ethiopian, and we tend to be pretty healthy people, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. And you're of Ethiopian descent. Just a few more questions, Ms. Purtee. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. I’ve always been pretty careful about what I put into my body. I guess that's why I'm a bit puzzled by this odor thing. I try to live a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, non-drinker, and you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. That's excellent. Okay, Ms. Purtee, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear on that front. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness detected. Skin appears normal as well. Thyroid feels normal. Now, I'm just going to briefly check your feet for any signs of infection or neuropathy. Feet look good, normal sensation. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. I don't see anything obvious that would be causing the change in odor.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, I guess, that there’s nothing obvious. So, what do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? Should I be worried? I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to smelling like myself! It's just unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Purtee. It is unsettling when something changes with your body. Given the unremarkable physical exam, and the information you've provided, it's unlikely to be anything serious at this point. However, a change in body odor can sometimes be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, or it could be related to metabolic changes, medication side effects, or even hormonal fluctuations. Because of the persistence of the odor despite good hygiene, and the fact it's generalized, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us check your kidney and liver function, rule out diabetes, assess your thyroid levels, and look for any signs of infection. We’ll also check your vitamin levels. It's a pretty standard panel, and should give us more information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I’d rather be safe than sorry, and I appreciate you taking this seriously. So, what do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? And where will I get the blood drawn? I usually go to the clinic down the street, is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very good question. You will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. And yes, you can go to the clinic down the street, that's perfectly fine, as long as they can send the results directly to me here at the clinic. I’ll send them a requisition form electronically. The results usually take a few days to come back, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the odor becomes significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms like fever, weight loss, or fatigue, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good. Fasting, send the results, and contact you if anything gets worse. I’ll make sure they have the right information to send it to you. Thank you, Doctor Annesley. I feel a lot better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Hopefully, it’s just a vitamin thing or something simple.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could ease your mind. I agree, it’s likely something simple. We'll get the results back as soon as possible and go from there. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
