DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it is… the words. They do not… come so easily now. It is very… frustrating. I forget things, yes, but this is… different. It’s like they are on the tip of my tongue, but… gone.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, Sherrell. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When did you first start noticing this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When… that is… a difficult question. It has been… some time, I think. Perhaps… six months? Or maybe longer. It is… gradual. Not sudden. I remember… struggling with names, mostly. Friends' names, even. It is… embarrassing, truly. I do not recall a specific… event that started it, just… slowly getting worse. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over about six months, starting with difficulty recalling names. That is helpful. And has this difficulty with words spread to other areas?
PATIENT: Other areas…? Um… yes. It is not just names. Sometimes… I search for the… the right thing to say. Even simple things. Like… describing something. Or… understanding what people tell me. It is like… a fog, sometimes. Not all the time, but… frequently enough to be… worrying. I do not like it. It makes me… anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Sherrell. It sounds very concerning, and it’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say "understanding what people tell me," is that difficulty with complex conversations, or even simple sentences?
PATIENT: Um… both, I think. Complex… yes, those are harder. But sometimes… even simple sentences. It is not the… hearing, I am sure of that. It is… processing. Like my brain is… slow. Or… searching for the meaning. And then… the moment passes and I have forgotten the question. It is very… frustrating. I apologize. I am not being very… clear, am I?
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Sherrell. It’s difficult to articulate these things, and you’re explaining it very well. So, difficulty with both understanding complex and simple sentences, and it feels like slow processing or searching for meaning. Do you notice this difficulty being worse at certain times of the day, or in certain situations?
PATIENT: Certain times… that is… a good question. I think… in the evening. Yes, definitely in the evening. And… when I am tired. Very tired. It is much worse then. Also… if there is a lot of… noise. Or if people are talking quickly. It overwhelms me, I think. It makes it even harder to… focus. I find myself… zoning out, sometimes. It is… unpleasant. And I do not want to be rude, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse in the evening, when tired, and in noisy environments. That's helpful information. Now, let's talk a little about other things going on in your life. Have you experienced any changes in your mood, such as feeling more depressed or anxious than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The anxiety, definitely. I mentioned that, I think. And… sadness. A lot of sadness, since… my wife passed. It has been… five years now. But… the grief comes in waves, you see. I try to… stay busy. But sometimes… it is overwhelming. I do not sleep well. And… I have lost my appetite. I just… do not feel much… joy, anymore. It is… difficult to explain. I am sorry. I am rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Sherrell. It’s very important to share all of this. The loss of your wife five years ago is significant, and it's completely understandable that you're still experiencing grief. And the sleep disturbance and loss of appetite are also important to know. Just to clarify, would you say the change in your words has gotten worse since your wife passed, or has it been more gradual over the entire five years?
PATIENT: Um… that is… a difficult question. I think… it was there, even before. A little bit. But… it has definitely gotten worse since. After she passed… I think I… stopped paying attention to things. I was… preoccupied with grief. And now… it is more noticeable. More… frequent. So… yes. Definitely worse since. I apologize. I am not… good at remembering timelines. It is… all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. We’ll take our time. It sounds like the grief likely played a role in making it more noticeable. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Let me think. High blood pressure… yes. I have that. For… many years now. I take… pills for it. A small orange pill. And… I had a… a little stroke, perhaps ten years ago. It was… not very serious. They said it was… a warning. I also… wear glasses, as you can see. Other than that… I do not recall anything… major. Is that… helpful? I am sorry if I am… forgetting something. My memory is… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Sherrell. High blood pressure, a stroke ten years ago, and wearing glasses. Do you recall what medication you take for the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That is… a difficult question. I do not… remember the name. It is… small and orange. And I take it… every morning. My daughter… she helps me with the pills. She… fills the little container for me. I should… ask her. I am sorry. I am… not very good at remembering things like that. It is… frustrating for everyone.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. Don’t worry about it at all. We can get that information from your pharmacy records. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… Yes. I had my appendix out, when I was… a young man. Perhaps twenty years old? And… I had a… a knee replacement, about five years ago. The left knee. It… bothered me for years. The doctor said it was… arthritis. Other than that… I do not think so. Is that… correct? My memory… it is… so unreliable. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a left knee replacement. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… Let me think… Yes. I take something for… my joints. For the arthritis. It is a… a white pill. And I take something for… sleep. Just before bed. A small blue pill. And… sometimes, when my knee bothers me, I take something for the pain. A yellow pill. My daughter… she keeps track of everything. I am… very fortunate to have her. I apologize for… not being more helpful. It is… frustrating for everyone.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Sherrell. Don’t apologize – you’re providing a lot of important information. Let's move on to family history. Do you have any family members who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… um… That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had… some problems with her memory, towards the end. She… forgot things. A lot of things. The doctor said it was… old age. And… my uncle, on my father's side… he had… something with his brain. I do not… remember the name. It made him… confused. And… sometimes… angry. Other than that… I do not think so. Is that… helpful? My memory… it is… so unreliable. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had memory problems and your uncle had some neurological condition causing confusion. That's good to know. Finally, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. I do not drink alcohol. It… does not agree with me. And I certainly do not smoke. It is… very bad for you. And… recreational drugs? No. Never. I am… a very ordinary man. I prefer… a quiet evening at home. With a good book. Or… spending time with my daughter. Is that… helpful? I apologize for… rambling. My memory… it is… so unreliable.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Sherrell. You’re not rambling at all, and you’ve given me a lot of valuable information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and a few simple tests to get a better understanding of your condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is… best. I am… willing to cooperate. I just… want to understand what is… happening. And… if there is anything that can be done. I apologize for… being so anxious. My memory… it is… so unreliable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. That’s what I’m here for. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. I’ll also do a quick cognitive screening test - just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It won't be painful or uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is… best. I trust your… expertise. I am… willing to cooperate fully. I just… want to understand what is… happening. And… if there is anything that can be done. I apologize for… being so anxious. My memory… it is… so unreliable. Perhaps you will find something… helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. It's a little elevated, 150 over 85. Not dangerously high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Reflexes are normal and symmetric. Balance is a little unsteady, but not significantly. Coordination is intact. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Um… today's date…? Let me think… It is… August…? Yes, August. The second. August 2nd. Is that… correct? I apologize. I am… not very good with dates. My memory… it is… so unreliable. It feels… distant. It’s like… trying to grasp smoke. Perhaps you should ask my daughter. She has… an excellent memory.
DOCTOR: August 2nd is correct. That’s good. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Oh, dear. Um… yes. Please, go ahead. I will… try my best. My memory… it is… so unreliable. It feels… distant. It’s like… trying to grasp smoke. I apologize if I… struggle. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Please remember those words. I'll ask you to recall them later. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your orientation to time and place. What year is it?
PATIENT: Um… What year is it…? Oh, dear. Let me think… It is… 2025, yes? Is that… correct? It feels… distant. Like… a dream. I apologize if I… struggle. My memory… it is… so unreliable. It feels… like trying to grasp smoke. Perhaps you should ask my daughter. She has… an excellent memory.
DOCTOR: 2025 is correct. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: Oh… Where are we…? Um… We are… in the doctor's office, yes? Your office, Doctor. A… a nice office. It is… very clean. And… suburban, I think? Is that… correct? My memory… it is… so unreliable. It feels… distant. Like… a dream. I apologize if I… struggle. Perhaps you should ask my daughter. She has… an excellent memory. It is… very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are in my office, in a suburban location. Now, can you tell me what brought you in today, in your own words?
PATIENT: Oh… Um. What brought me in today…? Oh, dear. It is… the words. They do not… come so easily now. It is… very frustrating. I forget things, yes, but this is… different. It is like they are on the tip of my tongue, but… gone. It is… difficult to explain. I apologize. My memory… it is… so unreliable. It feels… distant. It is… very frustrating. Perhaps you should ask my daughter. She has… an excellent memory.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I asked you to remember three words earlier. Can you tell me what those were?
PATIENT: Um… three words…? Oh, dear. Let me think… I… I cannot recall them. I am… very sorry. They are… gone. I cannot… grasp them. I am… very sorry. My memory… it is… so unreliable. It feels… distant. It is… very frustrating. Perhaps you should ask my daughter. She has… an excellent memory. I apologize… profoundly. It feels… like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. Thank you for your patience. Based on the information you’ve provided, your history, and the brief exam and cognitive screening, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with word finding and short-term memory. It's important to investigate this further to determine the cause. Several things could be contributing to this, including normal age-related changes, medication side effects, stress, grief, or other underlying medical conditions. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a brain imaging study, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Finally, I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is… best. I trust your… expertise. I want to understand what is… happening. And… if there is anything that can be done. I just… want to feel like… myself again. I just… want to understand what is… happening. And… if there is anything that can be done. I just… want to feel like… myself again. And… perhaps my daughter can help with the… arrangements. She has… an excellent memory. I apologize for… being so anxious. My memory… it is… so unreliable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. We’ll work through this together. I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests and the MRI. My nurse will schedule the appointments for you with the neurologist and the imaging center. And yes, absolutely, your daughter can assist with the arrangements – that's a great idea. I also want to give you a handout with some resources for cognitive health and support groups. It’s important to have support during this time. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms or feel confused, please don't hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… questions…? No, I think… not at this time, Doctor. You have… explained everything very… clearly. I just… want to understand what is… happening. And… if there is anything that can be done. I just… want to feel like… myself again. Perhaps my daughter can help with the… arrangements. She has… an excellent memory. I apologize for… being so anxious. My memory… it is… so unreliable. Thank you… very much, Doctor. You have… been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re in this together. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Sherrell. And please give my best to your daughter.
