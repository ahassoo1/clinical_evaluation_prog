DOCTOR: Good morning, Oreste. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Beinborn, you say? Sounds… foreign. Anyway, I’m here 'cause I can’t… breathe so good. Feels like sandpaper in my throat, and my eyes feel like they gonna fall out. Been happenin’ a while now, not just today. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, Oreste. Sandpaper in your throat and eyes feeling dry… I understand. And you said this has been going on for a while, but you're not sure exactly how long?
PATIENT: A while. A good long while. Weeks, maybe? Months? Time… it all kinda runs together now, you know? I used to be able to tell ya the make and model of every car that went past, but now… not so much. It’s the breathing that’s botherin’ me most. Makes me tired just thinkin' about it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It sounds frustrating when things aren't as clear as they used to be. Okay, so weeks to months of shortness of breath and a scratchy throat. Has this been getting progressively worse, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. Used to be just when I walked up those hills to get to the store, but now… now it’s just most of the time. Even sittin' here talkin’ is makin' me puff a little. And the mouth… always dry. Like the desert in there. I carry water, but it don’t help much. Used to chew gum, but that’s just… a bother now. Teeth ain’t what they used to be either, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s progressively gotten worse, even at rest. And the persistent dryness is definitely something to pay attention to. Do you notice any wheezing or coughing with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Wheezin’? Coughin’? Hmm… sometimes. Not a bad cough, more of a little… hack. Mostly at night. Makes my wife complain, but she ain’t here no more. Just me now. And the dust, you know? This town is full of dust. Always has been. Maybe that’s it. Just dust gettin’ in my lungs. I worked on the roads, fixin’ traffic lights and such. Lots of dust. Probably just old age and dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, a nighttime cough, and a history of exposure to dust from your work. That’s helpful information. Have you had any fever, chills, or chest pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I remember. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but just from the heat. This summer’s been a scorcher. Chest pain? Not really. Just… tight. Like a band around my chest when I try to take a deep breath. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And makes me nervous, you know? I don’t like feelin’ like I can’t breathe. It reminds me… well, never mind. Old man ramblings.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, just a tightness in the chest. That’s good to know. I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and oxygen levels, if that’s alright. It’ll just take a few minutes. Could you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Listen to my lungs, huh? Never had much luck with my lungs. Always coughin’ when I was a kid. Go ahead. Just try not to scare me. I don't like doctors pokin’ and proddin’. Makes me jumpy. And be quick about it, if you could. I got things to do, you know. Even at my age.
DOCTOR: Of course, Oreste. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay… I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds, and a little wheezing in your lungs. Your heart rate is a bit irregular as well. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little low. I’d like to check your blood pressure and take your temperature as well.
PATIENT: Ninety-two, huh? Low. Everything’s low these days. My bank account's low, my energy's low, now my oxygen's low. What does that mean, Beinborn? Is it serious? Don’t tell me I got somethin’ bad. I ain’t got time for bad. Just tell me what I need to do to get my breath back, alright? And quick about it. This whole thing is makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your temperature is normal. I understand your concern, Oreste. It’s not necessarily something bad, but it does mean we need to figure out what’s going on. Your oxygen level is a bit low, and with the wheezing I’m hearing, it sounds like there may be some inflammation in your lungs. It could be related to your history of dust exposure, or something else entirely. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I'm going to draw some blood to check for any infections and to see how well your kidneys and heart are functioning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood? More pokin’ and proddin’? Beinborn, you're makin’ me feel like a guinea pig. But… alright, alright. If you think it’ll help, go ahead. I just want to breathe normal again. Get this over with, alright? And tell me what you’re lookin’ for. Don’t just poke and prod and then tell me somethin’ I don’t understand. I need clear talk, Beinborn. Clear talk. Is it my lungs? Is it the dust? Just tell me straight. No fancy doctor words, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Oreste. Clear talk, I promise. We're looking to see if there’s any sign of infection or inflammation in your lungs. The X-ray will help us visualize that. The blood tests will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your breathing difficulties. It could be related to your dust exposure, but it's also important to rule out other things, like pneumonia, bronchitis, or even something related to your heart. It’s possible we’re looking at a combination of things. I’ll explain everything clearly once we have the results. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we'll get you scheduled for the X-ray. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, try to relax and take deep breaths. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths. Easier said than done. But… alright. I’ll try. And you, Beinborn, you remember what I said. Clear talk, no fancy words. I ain’t a smart man, never was. Just tell me what’s goin’ on, and what I need to do. And hurry up with those results. I got things to do, remember? Even at my age. .
DOCTOR: I absolutely will, Oreste. Clear talk, and as quickly as possible. The nurse will be right in. Thank you for your patience, and for letting me take a look at you today. .
