DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, it’s… the belching. I keep belching. It’s been happening for… a little while now, I think. Not always, but often enough it’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: Belching, alright. And how long has this “little while” been?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month? It's hard to say exactly. Not every day, like I said. Sometimes it's just after I eat, sometimes… just happens. It doesn't hurt, just… loud. And embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: A month, intermittent. Not associated with pain, primarily a social concern. Do you notice anything specific that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Let me think… Sometimes if I drink something with bubbles, like soda. But not always even then! And… sometimes when I’m stressed, maybe? I work in a factory, it can be… busy. I don’t know if that makes a difference. I eat pretty normal, I think. Rice, beans, chicken… the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bubbles seem to be a factor, and potentially stress. And you describe a fairly typical diet. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not really. Maybe… sometimes a little bit of heartburn? But not often. And I feel a little bloated sometimes after I eat, but I don’t know if that’s just… eating too much. It’s hard to say. I don't have any stomach pain or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Bloating and occasional heartburn. Alright. Have you tried anything to alleviate it?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I tried some antacid tablets once, but they didn’t seem to do much. I mostly just… try to ignore it. Or excuse myself. That's why I came, I guess. It's getting old. Is there something I can do?
DOCTOR: We'll need to rule out a few things. Let's start with a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and just feel around. Nothing invasive, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Sounds good. I hope it's nothing serious. I have to get back to work, you know? But I want to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Try to breathe normally. Okay. Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, although a little… gurgling. No masses palpable. Your weight is 66 kilograms and your height is 150 centimeters, giving you a BMI of 29.2. That's slightly overweight. Anything feel unusual when I pressed on your stomach?
PATIENT: No, it didn’t hurt. Just felt… normal, I guess. Like you said, just normal. And… 29.2? Is that bad? I never really thought about my weight. I just… eat. You know? I walk a lot at work, though. It’s a factory, lots of moving around.
DOCTOR: A BMI of 29.2 puts you in the overweight category. It’s not necessarily “bad,” but it can contribute to digestive issues. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds like we're dealing with a functional gastrointestinal issue, possibly related to diet and stress. Before we jump to conclusions, though, I’d like to order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Just to be thorough. It will check things like your thyroid function, and basic inflammation markers. Also, a stool sample to check for Helicobacter pylori – a common bacteria that can cause bloating and indigestion. Do you have any issues providing a stool sample?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Oh… um… I guess not? It sounds… unpleasant. But if it helps, I can do it. I just… don’t know how. Will someone tell me how to do it? And what about my thyroid? Is that serious? I never get sick, really.
DOCTOR: The stool sample is a bit inconvenient, yes, but it's a simple procedure. The nurse will provide you with a kit and detailed instructions. It’s just a small amount of stool collected at home. As for your thyroid, it's a precaution. Thyroid issues can sometimes manifest as digestive problems. It’s very common to check it. Given your insurance status, we’ll need to explore affordable lab options. I can recommend a few local labs that offer discounted rates. In the meantime, let’s focus on some lifestyle adjustments. Reducing carbonated beverages is a good start. Also, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than large portions. And we need to address the stress. Do you have any hobbies or relaxation techniques you use?
PATIENT: No insurance, that's right. I forget sometimes to mention it. I don't really have hobbies… I watch TV sometimes. And I talk to my sister on the phone. But… relax? No, not really. Work is… stressful. Always something going wrong. And I worry about my family, you know? It's hard to relax when you're worried. So, smaller meals and no soda… and try to relax. Easier said than done, Doctor. But I will try. Where do I get this… stool sample kit?
DOCTOR: The nurse's station will have the kit and instructions. I’m printing a list of affordable labs in the area now. I want you to focus on the diet and stress reduction for the next two weeks. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, please contact the clinic immediately. We may need to consider further testing, such as an endoscopy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? Oh dear. That sounds… scary. No, I don't think so. Just… the diet and the sample. And try to relax. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it's just the soda. And the stress. I will try. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fogelstrom. We'll take it one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care. .
