DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been bothering me for a long time now. A dry cough, mostly. Just… hacking, you know? Not much else comes with it. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. A while. It just… is.
DOCTOR: A cough for a “while,” you say. Alright. And when you say “dry,” does that mean it doesn’t produce any mucus or phlegm when you cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… mucus… phlegm… yes. No, I don’t think so. It’s just… air. Like when you’re… trying to clear your throat, but it doesn’t quite work, you know? Does that make sense? I’m sorry, my mind isn’t what it used to be. I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Pavlovec. Memory can be unreliable as we age. So, a dry, unproductive cough. Has it been getting worse lately, or has it remained about the same?
PATIENT: Worse… I think… maybe a little worse. Not much, but… I find myself coughing more at night. Keeps my wife… well, it used to keep my wife awake. She’s… gone now. But yes, more at night. And sometimes when I… when I’m working in the garage. Dust, probably. I work on cars, you see. Been doing that my whole life.
DOCTOR: I see. Cough worse at night and when working in the garage. Do you notice anything else that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers… Let me think. Cold air, maybe? When it gets really cold, it seems to bother it more. And… and sometimes when I eat. Not every time, but… certain foods. Spicy things, maybe? I don't know for sure. It’s hard to say. It just… happens. I don't pay much attention to it unless it’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, cold air and potentially spicy foods. And you mentioned working in the garage – do you use any sort of respiratory protection when you work on cars?
PATIENT: Respiratory… protection? Like a mask? Oh… no. No, I never used one. Never thought about it, really. Just always worked on cars, you see. Always been okay. A little dusty, maybe, but… never wore anything special. Never needed to. Though, maybe I should have. Now that I think about it…
DOCTOR: Well, that is… concerning. Now, let’s get a bit more information. Have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. And chills… well, it gets cold in the winter, but not… a fever chill. And weight loss… I’ve probably lost some weight, but I’m an old man. I’m not eating as much anymore. It's just… age, I suppose. I don't know. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Everything feels a little… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, do you have any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… no, not really. I get tired sometimes, but that’s just… being old. Wheezing… I don't think so. And chest pain… no. My chest feels… okay. Sometimes a little tight, maybe, but that’s probably just… my heart. It skips a beat now and then. But no real pain. It’s mostly just this cough. It’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to listen to your lungs and take your vital signs, if you don’t mind. It's important to rule out anything serious. Then, depending on what I find, we may need to consider a chest X-ray. If you’ll just have a seat here, please.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I don’t like being poked and prodded too much. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovec. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. I do hear some mild wheezing, particularly on the right side, and your breath sounds are slightly diminished in the lower lobes bilaterally. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/82, pulse is 88 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Given your age, prolonged cough, history of working in the garage without respiratory protection, and the findings on auscultation, I'm concerned about the possibility of chronic bronchitis or even COPD.
PATIENT: Chronic… what-itis? COPD? What does that mean, Doctor? Is that… bad? I just thought it was an old man’s cough. I've never been sick, not really. Just… tired. And a cough. You mentioned an X-ray… is that… necessary? I don't like those things. All that radiation…
DOCTOR: COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It's a lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe, often caused by long-term exposure to irritants like dust or smoke. And no, it’s not simply an “old man’s cough,” though it’s more common as we age. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and assess the extent of any damage. While there is some radiation involved, the benefits of diagnosing the problem far outweigh the risks, especially given your symptoms and history. It’s a standard procedure, and it will help us determine the best course of action. We need to rule out anything serious, and the X-ray is the best way to do that. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t want to cause trouble, and I trust your judgment. Explain it to me… what will it be like? And will it… will it hurt? I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. And I don't have insurance, Doctor. Will this be… expensive? This is all a bit much for an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Pavlovec. I understand your concerns. The X-ray itself is quick and painless. You’ll simply stand or lie down in front of a machine, and a brief pulse of radiation will pass through your chest. It doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. The technician will be behind a lead shield for safety. As for the cost, I’m aware you’re uninsured. Our billing department can work with you to establish a payment plan or explore options for financial assistance. We don’t want cost to be a barrier to your care. We’ll get through this together. First, we’ll get the X-ray. Then, we can discuss the results and develop a plan to help you breathe easier. I’ll write you a referral to the radiology department. They’re just down the hall. Do you have any questions before I send you over there?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… down the hall, you say? I suppose I’ll go then. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man and his cough. I hope it doesn't take too long. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. Please, take your time. The radiology staff will take good care of you. And don't hesitate to ask if you need anything. I’ll be here when you return. .
