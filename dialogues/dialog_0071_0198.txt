DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Liza. Welcome. Or… welcome back, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor Galena. No, I don’t think I’ve been here before, actually. I just moved to the area a few months ago. It's nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Ah, a new face! Wonderful. Well, welcome to the clinic then. My name is Matthias Galena, but you can call me Matthias. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I've been thinking about… well, how to handle stress a little better. A friend suggested I look into mindfulness or meditation. I’m not sure where to start, or even if it’s right for me, to be honest. I work a pretty physical job, you see – repairing signals and track switches for the railway – and it can be… a lot.
DOCTOR: Stress… yes, a very common concern. And a physical job like that, absolutely. Railway work… that is demanding. Mindfulness can be helpful, certainly, but let’s talk a bit more about what you’re experiencing. Could you describe what “a lot” feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… It’s not so much a feeling of being overwhelmed during the work, usually. I’m pretty focused when I’m actually doing the repairs, you know? It’s more afterwards, I think. Like, when I get home, my mind just… races. I replay things, worry about if I missed something, if I did something right. And it makes it hard to switch off, hard to sleep sometimes. I also find myself getting… irritable, I guess, with people. Not intentionally, but… shorter tempered than I used to be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing some after-effects of the stress – rumination, difficulty sleeping, increased irritability. It's good you’re recognizing these things. So, it’s not anxiety during the work itself, but more of a build-up afterwards, a difficulty winding down. Is this a recent thing, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely gotten worse recently, I’d say. Maybe the last six months or so? Before that, it was just… normal end-of-day tiredness. Now it feels like my brain doesn't want to stop. I remember my grandmother used to say I had a “busy mind,” even when I was a little girl. But this is different. It’s… persistent. And tiring. Even more tiring than the work!
DOCTOR: Six months… persistent. Okay. And has anything changed in the last six months besides the increasing stress?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Work has been the same, maybe a little busier with some track upgrades, but nothing drastic. I started volunteering at the animal shelter on Saturdays, which I really enjoy, so that's a good thing. I suppose… my sister called more often for a while, but she’s moved to Australia now, so that’s stopped. She was going through a rough patch and I was checking in on her a lot. Not much else, honestly. It’s just… gradually gotten worse. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a relatively stable life situation, with no major changes aside from your sister’s move. Volunteering sounds positive. Hmm. Before we go further, just to get a broader picture, are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this racing mind?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… I have been getting headaches, quite often actually. Mostly tension headaches, at the back of my neck and shoulders. And… well, my stomach hasn't been great. Not terrible, but just… unsettled. I haven’t lost any weight or anything, but I don't have much of an appetite sometimes. It’s probably just the stress, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It very well could be. Tension headaches and stomach upset are common stress responses. Okay. And just one quick question before we maybe do a quick check-up… are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications at all, thankfully. And no allergies, either. I'm pretty healthy, otherwise. I eat reasonably well, try to get enough sleep when I can, and I walk everywhere, so I get plenty of exercise. It's just… this mental and physical tension. It’s a bit frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Liza. That’s good to know. No medications, no allergies, reasonably healthy lifestyle. It sounds like you're right – this is definitely something we need to address. Would you mind if I just did a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, things like that – just to make sure there's nothing else going on?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. It’s good to know we’re taking it seriously. I suppose it's better to rule things out, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It always is. Please, have a seat on the table here. I'll just need you to loosen your shirt a little for me. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your reflexes and a few other things.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. Is there anything specific I need to do? Like, breathe in and out deeply, or…? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Liza. I’ll let you know if I need you to take a deep breath. It’s quite simple. Now, just relax, and we’ll get started. Deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular… no murmurs… lungs are clear… nothing obvious there. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Can you rest your arm here for me?
PATIENT: Okay. There we go. I always feel a bit silly doing these things. It feels like school! But it’s good to be checked, I suppose. I try to stay on top of things, but sometimes… you just don’t know what’s going on inside.
DOCTOR: It does feel a bit like school, doesn't it?
PATIENT: It really does! Everything seems normal there, reflexes are good. Now, I’m just going to check your blood pressure. Can you just relax your arm again? Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/88, but that’s not uncommon with stress. We’ll keep an eye on it. Everything else seems within normal limits. So, overall, it seems like you’re physically healthy. These symptoms… the headaches, the stomach upset, the difficulty sleeping, the racing mind… they're strongly suggestive of stress and anxiety. It's not to say it is just stress, but it's the most likely explanation.
PATIENT: That’s… actually a bit of a relief, if I’m honest. Knowing it’s probably not something… serious. I do tend to worry, you see. So, what do we do about it? You mentioned mindfulness earlier. Is that something you’d recommend? Or are there other options? I’m open to anything, really. I just want to feel… calmer. And sleep better. That would be a miracle!
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being proactive, Liza. Mindfulness can be very effective, but it’s not for everyone. There are several options. We could start with lifestyle modifications – ensuring you have a regular sleep schedule, limiting caffeine and alcohol, incorporating regular exercise – things like that. There are also relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation. And if those aren’t enough, we could consider talking to a therapist – cognitive behavioral therapy is very effective for managing stress and anxiety. I think starting with lifestyle modifications and relaxation techniques would be a good first step. We can then assess if further intervention is needed. Would that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Lifestyle modifications… I suppose I could definitely work on a better sleep schedule. And I do enjoy a cup of tea in the evening. Maybe I'll switch to herbal. And I already walk a lot, so that’s good. Relaxation techniques… I'm not sure where to start with those. Are there any resources you’d recommend? Books, websites, anything like that?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. There are many excellent resources. For relaxation techniques, I recommend the Headspace app. It's very user-friendly and has guided meditations. There's also a website called Calm.com, similar to Headspace. For more information on stress management, the American Psychological Association has a lot of helpful articles on their website - APA.org. And I can also give you a handout with some simple deep breathing exercises to practice at home. I’ll also write down the contact information for a local therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy, just in case you decide that’s something you’d like to explore. I’d like to see you back in a month to see how things are progressing. We can discuss how the lifestyle modifications and relaxation techniques are working, and if you’ve decided to try therapy. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Galena. This is all very helpful. The apps and websites sound great, and I appreciate you writing down the therapist’s information. I’ll definitely give the relaxation techniques a try, and I’ll see how things go. A month sounds good for a follow-up. I feel much better already, just having a plan. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. Remember, managing stress is a process, so be patient with yourself. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Alright, then. I’ll see you back in a month. Have a good day, and try to relax!
