DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Good morning to you too, Doctor. I... think my husband said something about needing to learn some things? About... health, maybe? I don’t really remember. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like he’s looking out for you, which is good. So, to clarify, you weren’t the one who scheduled the appointment specifically for a health concern of your own?
PATIENT: No, no. Not me. He just... keeps saying I don't take care of myself. Always working, you know? Sheet metal is hard work. Not much time for... whatever this is. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sheet metal work is demanding. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Even a quick check-up can be helpful to ensure everything is alright, given your busy schedule. Perhaps we can focus on preventative care, just to be sure. Before we get started, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What does that mean? Like... do I cough a lot? No. I don't think so. I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired after working with metal all day. Is that what you want to know? I don't go to doctors usually. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It sounds like you're generally feeling okay, just understandably fatigued from your work. When I ask about "general health," I'm trying to get a broader picture. Things like if you have any ongoing medical conditions, if you've had any surgeries, or if there's any history of health problems in your family. But we can absolutely start with how you're feeling right now. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Ugh. My back hurts sometimes. Always does after bending over metal. And my hands... they ache. They're always cut up, little things, nothing serious. Husband puts bandages on. Family? My mother... she had high blood pressure, I think. Very old woman now, living back in China. Don't see her much. Is this important? I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just tired and sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Back pain and hand aches, understandable with your line of work. We’ll definitely want to discuss those further. And it’s good to know about your mother’s high blood pressure; that family history is important. Let's talk about your hands for a moment. How often would you say they get cut?
PATIENT: Every day, almost. Little nicks, you know? From the metal sheets. Husband says I should be more careful. I try! It's hard. Gloves make it harder to feel what I’m doing. Usually just a little blood, I clean them up, put a bandage on. Sometimes they get a little swollen, but it goes away. Nothing ever… serious. Never had to go to the hospital for a cut.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent minor cuts, some swelling, but no major issues requiring hospitalization. We'll want to take a closer look at them to make sure there's no sign of infection. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your hands, your back, and then listen to your heart and lungs, just as a baseline. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Fine, I guess. But don't take too long, Doctor. I really need to get back to work. And be gentle with my hands, okay? They’re how I make my money. And… don't ask me to take off my shoes, alright? I've been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. No shoe removal necessary. I’ll just need you to roll up your sleeves and then we can start with a quick look at your hands. Okay, I’m just checking for any signs of swelling or infection. I see some minor abrasions and cuts, as you mentioned. There doesn't appear to be any active infection right now, but some of these cuts look a little irritated. Do you typically use any kind of antiseptic when you clean them?
PATIENT: Antiseptic? What's that? I just wash them with soap and water. Sometimes my husband puts some kind of cream on them, a white one. He gets it at the store. I don't pay attention to the name, honestly. He handles all that stuff. Just makes it better, stops the bleeding. Is that not good enough? I've been doing this for years. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, washing with soap and water is a good start. The cream your husband uses is likely a topical antibiotic, which is helpful. It's good you're using something to prevent infection. Now, I’m just checking your back. It does seem tender along your lower spine. Does the pain radiate down your legs at all?
PATIENT: Radiate? Like… spread? Sometimes. Not always. When I bend over, it shoots down my leg a little. But it goes away. I just try not to bend over too much. Husband says I should lift things with my legs, not my back. He’s always telling me what to do. It's just… work, you know? Metal is heavy. Can’t exactly avoid lifting it. Is this serious? I can’t afford to be off work.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. The pain radiating down your leg suggests possible irritation of the sciatic nerve, which can happen with strain or injury to your back. Given your job, that's not uncommon. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to address it to prevent it from getting worse. It sounds like you and your husband are already taking some good preventative measures, like lifting with your legs. However, based on what you've told me, I recommend we get an X-ray of your lower back just to rule out any structural issues. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh, great. More time wasted. And money, probably. I don't have insurance, you know. Husband said something about that. He gets angry about medical bills. Is it really necessary? I can just… be careful. Take more breaks. Can't we just give me some cream for my back and be done with it? I really need to go back to work. Metal isn't going to cut itself, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and time, Airam. It’s perfectly valid to be worried about that. An X-ray would help us determine if there’s anything beyond muscle strain causing your back pain. It will give us a clearer picture and allow me to recommend the most appropriate treatment. I can certainly write you a prescription for a stronger topical pain reliever for your back, but without an X-ray, we’re making a diagnosis without knowing the full picture. We can also explore options for lower-cost imaging centers if that would help. Given your discomfort and the potential for this to worsen, I do recommend at least considering the X-ray. Would you like me to discuss some options for low-cost imaging facilities in the area?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Low-cost… whatever. Just tell me where to go. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And make it quick, alright? I’ve got a schedule to keep. And… don't bother with the hand stuff. I told you, soap and water. It’s fine. Just the back. Low-cost place. Tell me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's a list of a few imaging centers in the area that offer reduced rates. I've highlighted one that specifically advertises cash discounts. I’ll also write you a prescription for a stronger topical pain reliever for your back to help with the discomfort while you schedule the X-ray. I still recommend keeping an eye on your hands, even with the soap and water; if you notice any increased redness, swelling, or pus, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions about the imaging centers or the prescription?
PATIENT: Huh. Okay. This place… "Radiology Now." Seems alright. Cash discount. Good. Prescription… I'll let my husband handle that. He knows about this stuff. I just need to… go back to work. Thank you, Doctor. I think that's all. I really need to go now. Don't expect me back unless something gets really, really bad. Metal isn’t going to cut itself. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Airam. I understand. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your condition worsens. Here’s a copy of your visit summary for your records, and this sheet has information about warning signs to look out for. Take care, and be safe at work. .
