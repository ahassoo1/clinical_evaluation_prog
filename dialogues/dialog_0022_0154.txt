DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They bother me. A lot. It keeps happening, and it’s… unpleasant. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a while now. Several times, I think. I just want it to stop happening, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds frustrating. When you say “bother you,” could you describe exactly what’s happening with your waterworks?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It… burns, mostly. When I go. And I have to go… often. Even when I don’t… need to, you understand? It’s a terrible feeling, and I worry about it. I don’t like being… inconvenienced, if you catch my drift. Is that… enough information? I’m sorry, I don’t always explain things well.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly fine, Ms. Wease. It's helpful to know it's burning and you're experiencing frequent urges to go, even when you don’t feel a strong need. To help me understand a bit better, can you tell me if you've noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I… I don’t recall. Maybe? It’s been so long, and I don't look, you understand. It’s… not a pleasant thing to examine. I really couldn’t say for certain. Is that… bad? I get so confused with these things. It all feels the same after a while.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Wease, it's perfectly understandable not to want to examine it closely. We can figure this out together. Okay. And have you noticed any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. Low down, on my back. It comes and goes. I thought it was just… my age, you know? Old bones creaking. I take some… pills for it, sometimes. But they don’t always help. It’s not a sharp pain, just… there. Does that make sense? I forget which pains are important, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A dull ache in your lower back. And you mentioned taking pills for it – what kind of pills are those, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? Yes, Ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. My daughter buys it for me. She says it’s good for aches and pains. I take two, sometimes three, when it’s really bothering me. But they don’t always work. I try not to take too many, you know. I don't want to… overdo it. I can't remember how often I take them… it varies.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed. And you said you've been experiencing this burning and frequent urination for several times – can you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a hard one. Several… months, I think? Maybe longer. A year, perhaps? It all blurs together after a while. It comes and goes in waves, you see. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. It's been particularly bad lately, which is why I came to see you. I just… want some relief, Doctor. It’s very distressing. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Wease. It's perfectly alright that you can't pinpoint the exact timeline. Several months, with periods of better and worse symptoms. Now, let me ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My daughter takes me to the doctor, you see. I don’t always remember what they say. I think… I had my blood pressure checked once, and it was a little high, but they gave me some pills for it. I take those regularly. But… kidney problems? No, I don’t think so. I don’t recall anything about my kidneys. And diabetes? No, not that I know of. I do like sweet things, but… that doesn’t mean anything, does it? It all gets so confusing. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more clear.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing just fine, Ms. Wease. It's alright to not remember everything. So, you do take medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… oh, here it is. Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I take one every morning, with my breakfast. My daughter makes sure I don’t forget. She's very good, that girl. I wouldn’t know what to do without her. It's... all a bit much, to keep track of everything, you know? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for high blood pressure. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. But that was… ages ago. Nothing since then. I’ve been very lucky, I suppose. Mostly just… aches and pains. And this… waterworks trouble. I'm trying to remember, but everything feels so distant now. Is it important? Perhaps my daughter knows more about this. She keeps all my medical papers.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know you had your tonsils removed as a child. And it's alright that you don't remember everything. We can always check with your daughter if needed. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't eat shellfish, but that's because I don't like it, not because I'm allergic. I sometimes get a little itchy when I'm around cats, but that’s just a mild irritation, nothing serious. No, I don't think I have any real allergies. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, you see. I’ve never been one to be bothered by things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Oh dear. Well, I mostly stay at home. I enjoy my garden, when the weather is nice. I read a bit. I watch television. It's… quiet. I used to travel more, when my husband was alive. But… that was a long time ago. I don't go out much these days. I don’t have much energy. I live alone, you see. It’s… comfortable, but lonely sometimes. I don’t drink or smoke, if that’s what you mean. Is that enough information? I hope I’m not boring you.
DOCTOR: No, you're not boring me at all, Ms. Wease. It's helpful to know about your lifestyle. It sounds like you enjoy a quiet life at home. Okay. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind. It makes me nervous. Is it going to hurt? I just want to get this sorted out, you see. I’ve been feeling so uncomfortable for so long. Please, Doctor, be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I will be very gentle. It won’t hurt, I promise. I'll just be listening and feeling. We'll take it slowly, and you can tell me if anything feels uncomfortable at any time. First, let's just check your blood pressure. Could you please take off your jacket?
PATIENT: Alright… blood pressure first, you say? Very well. I hope it’s not too high. My daughter worries about it, you see. She says I need to watch my salt intake. But I like a little salt on my food! Please, be careful. It's rather tender there, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm for me. I’m just going to inflate the cuff now. It will feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Alright… deep breaths. In… and out… It’s a bit difficult, sometimes. My lungs aren’t what they used to be. I used to be a very active swimmer, you see. But that was a long time ago. Is everything alright? I hope my breathing isn't too noisy. It sometimes rattles, if I get a cold.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, although I do hear a little bit of congestion. It's not concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Can you tell me where exactly hurts the most?
PATIENT: Oh… there. Low down… on my right side. It’s… a dull ache. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something is… full. It comes and goes, you see. It’s worse when I need to… go to the bathroom. Please be gentle. It's quite tender there. I haven't had any… serious problems, have I? It’s just been… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some tenderness in your lower right abdomen. It’s not significant, but it’s worth investigating further. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it’s possible you have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. The burning sensation, frequent urination, lower abdominal pain, and a slightly elevated blood pressure could all be consistent with that. However, we need to confirm it with a urine test. Would you be willing to provide a urine sample for analysis?
PATIENT: A urine test? Oh dear. Is it… serious? A UTI, you say? I’ve heard of those. Are they… painful? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… I can provide a sample. But please, tell me what it involves. I don’t like surprises, you see. And where exactly do I… go? It feels rather private, you know. Is it going to be… awkward?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Wease. It's not serious, at least not if we catch it early. A UTI is a common infection of the urinary tract. It can be uncomfortable, but it's usually treatable with antibiotics. Providing a urine sample is quite simple. You'll be given a sterile cup, and you'll simply need to collect a small amount of urine in the privacy of the bathroom. There's a sign with instructions. It's not awkward at all, many patients do it every day. The nurse will provide you with everything you need. I'll have the nurse come in and explain the procedure to you. If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to ask. Would you like me to have her come in now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I feel a bit better knowing it’s not… serious. And if it’s treatable with antibiotics, well, that’s good news. I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I just want to feel better. Yes, please, have the nurse come in and explain everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wease. I'll just go and get the nurse for you now. She'll be with you shortly. Try not to worry. We’ll get this sorted out. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you start to experience a high fever, chills, or pain in your back, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
