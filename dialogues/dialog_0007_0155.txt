DOCTOR: Hi Lyman, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… a tremor, I think they called it. My hands shake. Been happening… well, a while now. Not sure exactly how long. It’s annoying, that’s for sure. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor, you said. And it's been going on for a while, but you're not sure exactly how long. That's alright, we'll figure it out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More… hmm. It’s worse when I try to do things, you know? Like… holding a cup. Or writing. Not that I do much writing anymore. Used to, back when I was… well, never mind. It’s just… shaky. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times… not so much. Does that make sense? I worked with water, for years, at the plant… maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lyman. And it's good you're thinking about your work history, that could be relevant. So, it’s more noticeable when you’re actively doing something with your hands, like holding a cup or writing. Is it present when your hands are just resting in your lap?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… …Sometimes. Not always. It’s… sporadic, I guess is the word. When I'm just sitting, it might not be there at all. Or it might be a little bit of a quiver. It’s hard to say, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, sporadic, coming and going, sometimes present even at rest, but not always. That’s helpful. And it’s perfectly normal for memory to change with time, Lyman. We'll take things slow. Now, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… my wife and I, we divorced a few years back. That was… something. Other than that… not that I recall. I mostly keep to myself these days. Not much excitement, if you know what I mean. I haven't been feeling particularly different, just… shaky hands. And a bit tired sometimes, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: I understand. Life changes can be difficult. And fatigue is common. Let's focus on the tremor for now. Do you notice it more at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I think it’s worse in the mornings. When I first wake up. It takes a little while to… settle down. After I’ve had some coffee, maybe. Or maybe it just gets better on its own, I don’t know. It’s hard to tell what’s what these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the mornings, improving with activity or time. That’s good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tremor?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Like what kind of symptoms? I mean, just the shaking. No… no dizziness. No… trouble speaking. My balance is alright, I think. I haven’t fallen or anything. I just… wish my hands would stop moving, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness, no trouble speaking, balance seems good. That’s reassuring. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Lyman?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, they gave me some pills for that. And my knees… they act up sometimes, arthritis, the doctor said. Other than that… not that I recall. It was a long time ago, everything’s a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, and arthritis in your knees. Are you still taking any medications for those conditions?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. Stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago. The arthritis… I just take some over-the-counter pain relievers when it flares up. Nothing regular. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly avoid going to the doctor if I can help it. Too much fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with pollen sometimes, but that’s all. Nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, to get a better picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your reflexes, coordination, and a look at your hands. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh. An exam…? Well, alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. If you could just sit here for me. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, then we’ll take a look at your hands and check your reflexes. Okay, everything sounds pretty good, but your breathing sounds a little quieter than I’d like. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Okay, I do notice a tremor in both hands, as you mentioned. It seems to be more prominent on your right side. Your reflexes are a little slow, and I noticed a bit of difficulty with coordination.
PATIENT: See? There it is. Just shaking. It's been like that for ages, I swear. I guess I just thought it was old age catching up with me. Is it… bad? What does it mean? I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without spilling it all over myself.
DOCTOR: It's good that we're taking a closer look, Lyman. It's not necessarily "bad", but we need to figure out what's causing it. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it could be a few things. The mild tremor, along with the slow reflexes and slight coordination issues, makes me think of a few possibilities, including essential tremor, which is a common condition, or possibly something related to changes in your nervous system. However, it's too early to say definitively. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes, like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. I also think it would be helpful to get an image of your brain, a simple MRI, just to rule out any other structural problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… MRI… Oh, goodness. It’s always something, isn’t it? I really just wanted a simple answer. Can't I just take a pill or something? I don’t like the sound of an MRI. Are they… safe? And what if it’s something… serious? I don’t want to think about all that. I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but please, Doctor, try to keep it simple. I’m not getting any younger, and I don’t have a lot of energy for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Lyman. And I promise to keep it as simple as possible. The MRI is very safe; it uses magnetic fields and radio waves, there's no radiation involved. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. The blood tests are straightforward, just a simple draw. The reason I want to do these tests is to be thorough and rule out anything serious. Most likely, this is something manageable. Let’s start with the blood tests. I’ll write you a requisition. You can go to [local lab name], they don’t require an appointment. Once we have those results back, we can discuss the MRI and a plan of action. In the meantime, to help with the shaking, I can prescribe a low dose of propranolol, a medication that can sometimes help with tremors. We'll start with a small dose and see how you tolerate it. What do you think?
PATIENT: Propranolol… alright. As long as it doesn’t make me feel… strange. I don’t need any more things to worry about. And [local lab name]… I think I’ve heard of it. I just… I wish I knew what was going on. This uncertainty is the worst part. But alright, Doctor, let’s do the blood tests and see what they say. And the pill… if you think it’ll help, give it a try. Just please, keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lyman. Simple is the goal. Here are the prescription and requisition. The lab will send the results directly to the clinic. Once they’re back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any side effects from the propranolol, like dizziness, fatigue, or shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
