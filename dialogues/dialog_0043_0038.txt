DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brought me in. A friend suggested I look into…advance planning, she called it. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should…something happen. I believe she mentioned a form? Perhaps an Advance Directive or a POLST form? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It's very thoughtful of you to consider advance care planning. It's a proactive step, and it's common to feel a bit overwhelmed with the terminology. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both excellent tools for ensuring your wishes are respected. To clarify, are you thinking about planning for a specific illness, or is this more of a general desire to have these things in place?
PATIENT: A specific illness…no, not that I’m aware of. I suppose it’s…general. I just want to be prepared. My ex-husband…it was a difficult situation when his mother was ill. A lot of arguing, a lot of uncertainty. I’d like to avoid that, if possible. I don’t have any strong feelings about…specific treatments, not yet. Just the peace of mind knowing things are…sorted. Does that make sense? I’m terribly sorry for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Buoniconi. It's quite common to be motivated by wanting to avoid difficult situations for your loved ones. You're not being vague at all – it's helpful to understand your goals. So, it sounds like you're interested in documenting your overall wishes regarding medical care, should you become unable to communicate them yourself. Before we delve into the specifics of the forms, let’s quickly review your medical history. I see here you’re 35 years of age. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Thirty-five, yes. And…medical conditions? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. I had a bout of the flu last winter, a rather nasty one, but that was it. I don’t take any regular medications, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. I see a dentist twice a year, of course, for check-ups. And…I think that’s it. My memory, you see. It’s frustrating. Perhaps my primary care physician has more detailed records?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you haven't had any major health concerns. It’s always helpful to have a starting point, even if it’s simply a history of good health. We can certainly reach out to your primary care physician for more detailed records if you'd like. Just to be thorough, have there been any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in your family?
PATIENT: Family illnesses…that's a bit difficult. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father…he passed away several years ago. It was…heart related, I think. But honestly, Doctor, I wasn’t very close to either of them. I don’t recall specific details. My brother might know more. He was always the one keeping track of such things. Is it alright if I say I'm not certain? I don't want to mislead you with inaccurate information. It’s all rather…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. It's perfectly alright to say you're not certain. We’re not aiming for absolute precision at this stage; it’s simply helpful to have a general idea. Knowing about a family history of heart disease is useful, and we can always explore that further if needed. Now, let’s move on to some lifestyle questions, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that, Doctor. I've never smoked a day in my life. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a bit of a homebody, actually. I prefer quiet evenings with my work. I’m an etcher and engraver, you see. It requires a steady hand and a clear mind, which wouldn’t be conducive to…those sorts of habits.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Buoniconi. A steady hand and clear mind are certainly valuable assets in your profession. It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Before we discuss the Advance Directive and POLST forms in detail, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your current health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh. I hadn’t…anticipated that. Is it absolutely necessary? I feel perfectly well, Doctor. I haven’t been experiencing any symptoms, and I’m just hoping to get these forms sorted out. But…if you insist, I suppose. I just…I’m not particularly fond of doctors’ offices, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. A full physical exam isn’t strictly necessary for completing these forms, but it’s helpful for establishing a baseline and ensuring we have a complete picture of your health. It will only take a few minutes – I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your general condition. We can certainly skip it if you prefer, but I want to make sure we're proceeding with all the information available. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well…if it truly is just a few minutes, and you feel it would be…beneficial, I suppose I can manage it. But please, be gentle. And try not to…startle me. I’m easily…flustered. And perhaps explain what you’re doing as you go? It would help ease my anxiety. Just…a quick check, you said?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. A quick check is all it will be. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take things at your pace. Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. It's a simple cuff around your arm. Do you have any history of white coat hypertension – meaning your blood pressure goes up simply because you’re in a doctor’s office?
PATIENT: Oh, that…yes, actually. My friend warned me about that. She said I tend to…tense up in these situations. It always seems to be a bit higher than usual. Perhaps we should take it a few times? Or…is that too much trouble? I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Not a burden at all, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s good to be aware of white coat hypertension, and taking multiple readings is the best approach. We’ll give your arm a moment to relax between each reading. Alright, just relax your arm and breathe normally. I'm going to inflate the cuff now. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, that first reading was 145/90. Let's wait a minute and try again. Just focus on your breathing.
PATIENT: Alright… I'm trying. It's just… a bit unsettling. All those beeping machines and…sterile smells. It brings back unpleasant memories, though I can't quite place them. Perhaps that's why my blood pressure is elevated. Is it alright if I hum a little tune? It helps me focus.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. Hum away, please. It sounds like a lovely tune. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in a medical setting, and you're doing a wonderful job of relaxing. Okay, let's see… that second reading is 138/85. Much better. And let’s take one more, just to be sure. Alright, the final reading is 132/82. I think we have a good baseline now. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning given your history of white coat hypertension. We can monitor it at future appointments. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, in and out. I’ll use the stethoscope to listen to the sounds.
PATIENT: Alright… just listening, you said? It feels… strange. All those little noises. Are you hearing anything unusual? Please don’t hesitate to tell me if you are. I’d rather know, even if it’s not good news. My memory is… unreliable, so I won’t remember much later anyway. But I want to be informed now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconi. Your heart sounds are regular and strong. I don’t hear any murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Your lungs are clear, and I don’t hear any wheezing, crackles, or other concerning sounds. Everything sounds normal at this time. Now, let's just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Can you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: “Ah.” Is everything alright? It feels… intrusive, if I’m being honest. I’ve always been quite private. And I haven’t been feeling unwell, so I’m not sure why we’re doing all of this. Perhaps we could skip this part? I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to speak up, Ms. Buoniconi. Your comfort is my priority. We can certainly skip this part. It was simply a routine check to rule out any obvious signs of illness, but it’s not necessary if you’re feeling uncomfortable. Alright. So, with the physical exam complete – or, rather, partially completed – let's move on to discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form. Do you have any initial questions about these documents before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Yes… I suppose I do have questions. My friend mentioned that the Advance Directive is about…future wishes in general? And the POLST form is more…specific? For when things are…urgent? It’s all a bit hazy, as I said. And what happens with these forms once they’re completed? Who sees them? And can I…change my mind later?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Buoniconi. You've hit on the core differences perfectly. The Advance Directive – also known as a living will – outlines your overall wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It covers things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, feeding tubes, and pain management. It’s a broader document, allowing for more detailed preferences. The POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific form. It’s meant for individuals with serious illnesses or frailty and translates your wishes into actionable medical orders. It’s typically discussed with your physician and is more immediate in its application. As for who sees them, copies are kept in your medical record and are accessible to your healthcare team. You can also share copies with your family and designated healthcare proxy – the person you appoint to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. And absolutely, you can change your mind at any time. These forms are not set in stone. You can revise or revoke them as your wishes evolve. It's about ensuring your preferences are always respected. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that…clears things up considerably. The healthcare proxy sounds important. Someone I trust to… advocate for me. I believe my brother would be a good choice. He’s always been very…level-headed. So, the Advance Directive is more about…general principles, and the POLST form is for specific situations. And both can be changed. That’s…reassuring. Perhaps we could start with the Advance Directive? I think that would be less overwhelming than the POLST form. And you can guide me through it, yes? I’m not sure where to begin. It’s all so…daunting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. We will definitely start with the Advance Directive, and I will guide you through every step of the process. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed – that’s why I’m here to help. This form is divided into several sections. We’ll go through each one together, and you can indicate your preferences as we go. There’s no pressure to answer any questions you’re not comfortable with. And we can take as much time as you need. The first section is about designating your healthcare proxy. As you mentioned, your brother would be a good choice. We’ll need his full name, address, and contact information. Do you have that readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Let me see… Here we are. His name is Dimitri Buoniconi. His address is… 142 Birchwood Lane, Urban, State. And his phone number is… 555-123-4567. He's a lawyer, so he's accustomed to paperwork, which is a relief. He's a bit… serious, but very reliable. And he knows my wishes, or at least, he thinks he does. It's been some time since we last discussed these matters.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, the next section asks about your values and goals for medical care. It's a bit open-ended, but it helps your healthcare team understand what's important to you. Do you have any specific beliefs or preferences about quality of life, pain management, or end-of-life care?
PATIENT: Quality of life… yes. That’s important. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially if…if there’s no hope of recovery. I value independence, and I don’t want to be a burden on others. And pain management is crucial. I have a…low tolerance for pain. I wouldn't want to suffer needlessly. As for end-of-life care… I suppose I would want to be surrounded by loved ones, if possible. A peaceful environment, and… dignity. I don't want to be alone. It sounds…melodramatic, but that’s how I feel. Is that…sufficient? I'm not sure how detailed I need to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly sufficient, Ms. Buoniconi. You’ve expressed your wishes very clearly and thoughtfully. It’s important to be honest about what matters most to you, and you’ve done that beautifully. The next section is about specific medical treatments. It asks about things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and dialysis. We’ll go through each treatment individually, and you can indicate whether you would want it, wouldn’t want it, or would defer to your healthcare proxy. Are you ready to begin discussing these treatments?
PATIENT: Yes… I suppose so. It's… daunting, thinking about all those things. CPR, ventilation… I don't even understand what they entail, really. Perhaps you could explain them to me as we go? And I'm not sure I have strong feelings about any of it, to be honest. I just… don't want to prolong suffering. And I trust my brother to make the right decisions, if I'm unable to. Perhaps we can start with the easiest one? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything as we go. There’s no pressure to rush, and we can skip any section you’re not comfortable with. Okay, let’s start with CPR. This is a procedure used to restart your heart and breathing if they stop. It involves chest compressions and, sometimes, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. It can be life-saving, but it’s also physically demanding and not always successful. Some people prefer to forgo CPR if they have a serious illness or are frail, as it may only prolong suffering. The form asks whether you would want CPR performed, wouldn’t want it performed, or would defer to your healthcare proxy. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: CPR… Hmm. I… I don’t think I would want it performed. I don’t want to be…brought back, if my time has come. I'd prefer a peaceful passing, if possible. And I wouldn't want to put my brother through the trauma of watching it, or having to make that decision. I trust his judgment, but I don't want to burden him with it. It's a difficult thought, but that's how I feel. I'm not sure if that makes sense. It feels… strange, saying it out loud.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Buoniconi. You’ve expressed your wishes very clearly and thoughtfully. There’s absolutely no shame in wanting a peaceful passing, and it’s commendable that you’re thinking about these matters in advance. Okay, let’s move on to mechanical ventilation. This involves using a machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to do so on your own. It can be life-saving in certain situations, but it also requires a tube to be inserted into your airway and can be uncomfortable. Some people prefer to forgo mechanical ventilation if they have a serious illness or are frail, as it may only prolong suffering. What are your thoughts on mechanical ventilation?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… a machine? That sounds… unpleasant. And intrusive. I… I don’t think I would want that either. I value my independence, and I wouldn’t want to be reliant on a machine to breathe. It sounds… isolating. And I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no hope of recovery. I’m sorry, it’s probably a morbid thought. I think I would prefer to let nature take its course. Does that make sense? I’m not sure if I’m explaining myself properly. It’s just… I don’t want to be kept alive at all costs.
DOCTOR: You're explaining yourself perfectly, Ms. Buoniconi. You’ve expressed your wishes very clearly and thoughtfully. It takes courage to think about these matters, and you're doing a wonderful job. It's entirely reasonable to want to let nature take its course and to prioritize quality of life over prolonging life at all costs. Okay, let’s move on to artificial nutrition and hydration. This involves providing you with fluids and nutrients through an IV or feeding tube if you’re unable to eat or drink on your own. It can be life-sustaining in certain situations, but it also has potential risks and complications. Some people prefer to forgo artificial nutrition and hydration if they have a serious illness or are frail, as it may only prolong suffering. What are your thoughts on artificial nutrition and hydration?
PATIENT: Artificial… nutrition? Another tube? Oh dear. I… I don’t know. That sounds… distressing. I think… I think I would prefer to let nature take its course with that as well. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if I’m unable to eat or drink on my own. It wouldn't be a natural way to go. And it sounds… uncomfortable. I’m sorry, I’m probably being morbid again. But that’s how I feel. It sounds like a lot to endure, if there’s no hope of recovery. Is that… acceptable? I’m not sure if I’m making the right decisions, but I’m trying to be honest about what I want.
DOCTOR: You’re making absolutely the right decisions, Ms. Buoniconi. There’s no right or wrong answer here, and you’re being incredibly thoughtful and honest about your wishes. It takes courage to think about these matters, and you’re doing a wonderful job. We’ve now covered CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition and hydration. Those are the main treatment options outlined in this form. There are a few other sections about pain management and spiritual preferences, but we can skip those if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to continue, or would you like to stop here?
PATIENT: Oh… I think I would like to stop here, please. I'm feeling quite overwhelmed, as you can imagine. I think we've covered the most important things. And I trust my brother to make the right decisions about anything else that may come up. I'm just glad to have these wishes documented, so he knows what I want. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You've been very kind and understanding. What happens next? Do I need to sign anything?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. I'm glad I could help. It's perfectly alright to stop here. We’ve documented your wishes very clearly, and that's the most important thing. Here is a copy of the form for your records. You'll need to sign it in the presence of a witness – someone who isn't your brother or a healthcare provider. And then you can distribute copies to your family and primary care physician. I’ll also ensure that a copy is added to your medical record here at the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Everything seems to be in order. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I feel much better now, knowing that my wishes are documented. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I think that’s all. I suppose I’ll be going now. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. And take care. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Kalinski. Goodbye.
