DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Deschane. It is… a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have been having… a lot of gas. More gas than usual, you understand. It is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: “A lot of gas,” alright. And when did you first start noticing this increase in… flatulence?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. It began… perhaps three weeks ago? Yes, around July 10th, I believe. I remember because the weather was very warm then, and I had a small picnic with a friend. A very small picnic.
DOCTOR: July 10th. And was there anything specific you ate at this picnic, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I recall perfectly. We had… sausages. And a potato salad. And… a small piece of cake. It was a nice cake, I must say. Chocolate. Nothing too fancy, but good chocolate. I did drink a fizzy drink too… a cola, I think.
DOCTOR: Sausages, potato salad, chocolate cake, and cola. Right. And has this gas been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… mostly constant, Doctor. But it gets worse after I eat. Especially if I eat… well, anything really. But sausages are particularly bad. I do enjoy a good sausage, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, while I appreciate your… honesty, it's important to understand that certain foods will cause increased gas production. Now, aside from the gas, have you noticed any other changes in your digestion?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me think… I have been… a little bit bloated, yes. And sometimes my stomach feels… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… full. And gurgly. It makes noises, you understand? Very embarrassing noises.
DOCTOR: Bloating and abdominal discomfort with audible bowel sounds. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, or anything unusual with the color or consistency?
PATIENT: Hmm… the bowel movements are… regular. Yes, regular. Not diarrhea, not… blocked up. The color… normal, I believe. Brown. Yes, quite brown. Consistency… also normal. Nothing different there, Doctor. I am quite regular, you see. It is… reassuring, in a way.
DOCTOR: Reassuring, perhaps. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no weight loss. If anything, I might have gained a little. I do enjoy my food, you understand. And I am not very active. I mostly… read. And sometimes visit friends. No weight loss at all, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No weight loss. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. No, no medications. I take nothing regularly. Sometimes, if I have a headache, I take a… a small pill. But that is all. And no supplements, no vitamins. Nothing like that. I prefer to eat healthy, you understand. Even if it causes gas sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. I have eaten many different things in my life, and I have never had a reaction. Never! Not to food, not to medicine. Perfectly fine, you see. I am a very robust man, generally. Besides the gas, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with dietary gas. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'm going to perform a quick physical examination. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. Please, do whatever you need to do. I am… a little nervous, but I understand it is necessary. You will listen to my stomach, yes? With that… that tube thing? I am ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. And I will begin. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, albeit a bit… active. No significant tenderness to palpation. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. No masses palpable.
PATIENT: Everything alright, Doctor? You did not find anything… bad? It is just the gas, you think? I am a little relieved, if I am honest. A little embarrassed, of course, but relieved. What do you suggest, Doctor? Do I need to… stop eating sausages entirely? That would be a great sacrifice, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, while the examination didn’t reveal anything alarming, I’m not prepared to definitively diagnose this as “just gas” without further investigation. The bloating and persistent discomfort warrant a little more scrutiny. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any underlying conditions. As for the sausages… I’m not going to tell you to eliminate them completely. But significantly reducing your intake and observing whether your symptoms improve is a reasonable first step. And avoid fizzy drinks. I’ll also provide a list of foods that are known gas producers. Follow that list for a week and keep a food diary. We’ll review it at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: A blood test… and a stool test… Very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. A food diary… and a list of foods. It sounds like a lot of work, but if it helps… I will do it. I will diligently record everything I eat. And I will try to limit the sausages. A small sacrifice, for the sake of my health. When is the follow-up appointment, Doctor? And where do I go for the tests?
DOCTOR: The lab requisition is for the tests. You can have those done at any Quest Diagnostics location. I've included a list of nearby locations on this sheet. The dietary guidelines… well, it's self-explanatory. As for the follow-up… I have an opening on August 16th at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August 16th at 10:00 AM… yes, that will work perfectly, Doctor. Thank you very much. You have been very helpful, and very patient with my… rather embarrassing problem. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your kindness. Is there anything else I need to do, or any questions you have for me before I leave? I want to be sure I follow your instructions exactly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, I expect you to take this seriously. This isn't simply about “gas.” If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – particularly fever, bloody stools, severe abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss – contact my office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand completely. Fever, bloody stools, severe pain, weight loss… I will contact you immediately if any of those occur. I promise. I will take this very seriously, Doctor. And I will diligently follow your instructions. Thank you again for your help. I will see you on August 16th. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Good day. And Mr. Goodstein… try to limit the sausages. It will make things easier for both of us. .
