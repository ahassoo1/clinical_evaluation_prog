DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Havird, is it? Yes, good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about some papers. My wife, she said I need something from you. For… time off work, I think? Or maybe… something with the insurance? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. Something about needing paperwork for… well, for being unable to work properly. I’m the Directors, Religious Activities and Education at my church, you see, and… it’s been a little hard lately.
DOCTOR: Right. Paperwork. Yes. It is helpful when patients know what they need. So, let's try to untangle this. You’re saying you need something for time off work… because it’s been hard lately doing your job?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Hard… it's not a physical thing, exactly. More like… difficult to concentrate, and remember things. Very frustrating. My wife, bless her, she handles most of the details. She said something about FMLA, maybe? Or disability? I really don’t know. I just know I need a piece of paper from you to… explain things. And to keep my job, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, difficulty concentrating and remembering things… impacting your work. And your wife mentioned FMLA or possibly disability. Let's start with what you’re experiencing. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That’s… difficult. It feels like it’s been building for a while, honestly. Maybe six months? Or was it longer? It’s hard to pinpoint. I used to be very sharp, could recall scripture easily, organize events… now, I find myself forgetting names, losing my train of thought mid-sentence. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. My wife notices it too, of course.
DOCTOR: Six months… progressive difficulty with memory and concentration. Alright. And has anything changed in the last six months?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… not really. Church is… the same. We had a small fundraiser, but that was stressful, as they always are. My wife and I… we haven't traveled anywhere. Oh! We did have a new minister join the team, about three months ago. A young man, very enthusiastic. He’s a bit… demanding, always asking for reports and meetings. But I don't know if that’s the cause of anything. It's just… life, I suppose. Everything feels a little more difficult these days.
DOCTOR: Demanding new minister… Alright. And outside of work and church, are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me see. My appetite hasn't been great, I suppose. My wife has to remind me to eat sometimes. And… I haven’t been sleeping as well. I wake up a lot during the night, thinking about… things. Mostly work, I think. Just… worrying. Nothing major, just… old man stuff, probably. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had much energy for it lately either. Everything feels like a bit of an effort.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, disrupted sleep, decreased energy… and continued difficulty with concentration and memory. Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision or any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. A little bit of tension sometimes, but nothing I’d call a headache. Vision… that’s a good question. I wear glasses, you see, so it’s hard to tell. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I just assume that’s the glasses needing adjusting. I haven't been to the eye doctor in… oh, goodness, I don't even remember when. Probably a year or more. It's all a bit of a muddle, honestly. My wife usually takes care of those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, once a day. And… sometimes I take something for indigestion, if I eat something rich. Allergies… no, not that I know of. My wife always checks before giving me anything. She’s very careful. I can't recall the name of the blood pressure pill, though. It’s… been a while since I’ve had to worry about names.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Well, I had pneumonia a few years back, but that was a long time ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football. Nothing serious. Oh! And I had my appendix out, when I was young. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. I've always been a healthy man, mostly. My wife would know more, to be honest. She keeps all the records. It's just… a bit of a blur, all these years. Everything feels so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a tricky one. My father… he had some heart trouble, I think. And my mother… she developed some memory problems when she got older. But I don’t know the specifics. We weren't very close, to be honest. And they both passed away a long time ago. My wife remembers more about it, I’m sure. She’s very good with those sorts of details. It’s just… a bit hazy, all these years. Everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, to summarise… you're experiencing progressive difficulty with concentration and memory over the past six months, accompanied by decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, and decreased energy. You had pneumonia some time ago, and had your appendix removed. Your father had heart trouble, and your mother developed memory problems later in life. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, I think… yes, that sounds about right. It’s all a bit of a muddle, but yes, that’s… approximately correct. I’m glad you summarized it, to be honest. It's hard to keep track of everything. It all feels so… vague. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. I want to be able to remember things, concentrate… and keep my job. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like there’s been a gradual decline in several areas. Given your symptoms and family history, it’s important we investigate this further. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes for your memory and concentration issues. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to rule out any infections. And I also want to get a referral for a neuropsychological evaluation. That will help us assess your cognitive function and determine the extent of any impairment. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and… a what-now? A neuropsychological… evaluation? That sounds… complicated. Is that necessary? I just… I just need a piece of paper for my job, you see. Is there anything simpler we can do? I’m not very good with tests and… procedures. And honestly, the thought of all that… it’s a bit overwhelming. Could we not just… talk about it some more? Perhaps it’s just stress? My wife… she’ll be very concerned about all this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, with all due respect, simply assuming it’s stress isn’t sufficient. Given the progressive nature of your symptoms and your family history, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. A neuropsychological evaluation is a thorough assessment of your cognitive function – your memory, attention, language skills, and so on. It's the gold standard for diagnosing cognitive impairment. And blood work is a basic test to check for underlying medical conditions that can affect cognitive function. We’re not talking about invasive procedures here. It's a responsible step to ensure we identify the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate plan. Refusing investigation could delay diagnosis and treatment. I understand your wife may be concerned, but this is about your health. I recommend we proceed with the blood work and the referral. Are you willing to do that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Blood work… and the… evaluation. But… could you explain it to me slowly? And perhaps you could talk to my wife too? She’ll want to know everything. She… she worries. It all just feels so… daunting. I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. That’s all I want. And to keep my job. Please… just help me feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your concerns, and I will certainly explain everything slowly and thoroughly. The blood work is simple – we’ll just take a small sample of your blood to check for certain levels. And I’m happy to discuss the neuropsychological evaluation with your wife. It involves a series of tests administered by a specialist to assess your cognitive function. It’s not a pass or fail test, it just helps us understand what areas may be affected. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now, and I'll get the referral for the evaluation completed. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they're available. And I will be happy to speak to your wife – do you have her number?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Her number is… 555-123-4567. She’s… very organized, she’ll have all the questions. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it to me… and for talking to my wife. It… it means a lot. And please… just tell me if there’s anything seriously wrong, okay? I… I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse contact your wife after the blood work is done. And I assure you, I will explain everything clearly and honestly, every step of the way. We’ll address any concerns you both have. Let me just get the nurse in here to start the blood work. It shouldn't take long. Nurse, could you come in here please?
