DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It's been going on for… a long time now, I guess. I don't really keep track of things like that anymore. It's just… draining. Honestly, I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when you’re feeling consistently tired and it impacts your daily life. “A long time now” is helpful, but could you try to give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Ugh, details… See, that's the hard part. It’s… before my husband passed, definitely. Maybe… a year? More? I really can’t say for sure. It just slowly got worse, you know? I used to be able to do everything – gardening, cooking, taking care of the house. Now… now I mostly just sit. Even getting to the store feels like a big deal.
DOCTOR: I see. And it sounds like this tiredness has gradually affected your ability to do things you enjoy. That’s significant. Before your husband passed and now… about a year, perhaps longer. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… not just sleepy, if that makes sense? Like, I can sleep eight hours and still wake up exhausted. It's… heavy. Like there's a weight on me all the time. And it’s not just physical, it’s… mental too. Hard to focus, you know? Everything feels like a struggle. Sometimes I just… stare at the wall.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Ms. Licano. It’s helpful that you differentiate between just feeling sleepy and this heavier, more pervasive exhaustion. And the mental fatigue – the difficulty concentrating, the feeling of struggling – that’s important information as well. To get a better picture of what might be causing this, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your general health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Ask away. I… I don’t have much of a memory these days, so if I don’t remember something, please just tell me. I'm on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. We’ll take things at your pace. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare coverage. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor… before… he said my cholesterol was a little high, I think. He put me on something for it, but I don't remember the name. And… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… painful. Other than that… not really. I think. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, high cholesterol managed with medication, and gallbladder removal in the past. That’s helpful. And it’s understandable that things aren’t crystal clear. Do you recall what, if anything, your doctor told you about why your cholesterol was high?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. He just… gave me a pill and told me to take it. I think he said something about diet, but… I was so worried about the numbers at the time, I didn't really listen to the rest. I just wanted it fixed. I don’t really pay attention to those details.
DOCTOR: I understand. Numbers can be overwhelming. And it’s common to focus on getting a solution rather than the specifics. Now, regarding your current medications – besides the cholesterol medication – are you taking anything else regularly, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cholesterol pill. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. It's… Ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind you can buy at the store. That’s about it. I try not to take too much of anything, honestly. Makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the cholesterol medication and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat everything! Now… now I don’t really have much of an appetite. But it's not an allergy, just… tiredness, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And the loss of appetite is another piece of the puzzle. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he had something with his stomach, I remember that being a big deal. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don't really know all the details. My brother is healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and a stomach issue, potentially cancer, in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? I… I mostly stay home. I used to garden, like I said, but… I don’t have the energy anymore. I watch a lot of TV. And… I don’t really see many people. My husband… he did everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's okay to take your time. By lifestyle, I mean things like your diet, if you smoke or drink alcohol, and your general level of physical activity. But it sounds like you’ve experienced a significant change in your routine since your husband passed. Just to clarify about diet – what would a typical day of eating look like for you now?
PATIENT: Oh… not much. I usually have a piece of toast in the morning. Sometimes cereal. Lunch is… maybe a sandwich, if I’m feeling up to it. Dinner is… whatever’s easiest. A frozen meal, usually. I don’t really cook anymore. It takes too much effort. I used to love cooking…
DOCTOR: I see. And it sounds like you’ve lost some of your appetite and are eating simpler meals. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely weight loss. My clothes are… much looser than they used to be. I haven't weighed myself, but… I can feel it. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticeable weight loss. That's important information. Alright, Ms. Licano, I’d like to do a brief physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. We’ll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and do a general assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just… get it over with, please. I have things to do… or, well, I would have things to do if I had any energy.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. It's 130/80, which is slightly elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart… Your heart rate is regular, but a bit on the slower side. I hear no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to take your temperature, which is 98.6, normal. So, everything seems generally okay, but the tenderness in your abdomen and the weight loss are concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and this preliminary exam, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These tests will check your thyroid function, blood count, electrolytes, and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Fine. Whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. I just want to feel… normal again. Are they going to take a lot of blood? I don’t really like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about needles, Ms. Licano. We’ll only take what’s necessary to get a good sample. It will be a few vials of blood, about what you'd expect for routine blood work. I'm ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of you. After the tests, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week… um… Tuesday afternoon? That might work. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I get tired easily, you know. And… please make sure the person taking the blood is gentle. I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Tuesday afternoon works perfectly. I’ll make a note to have a very experienced phlebotomist – someone skilled with drawing blood – take care of you. They’re very gentle and will make sure you’re comfortable. In the meantime, I want to recommend that you try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. We'll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Licano. Do you have any questions for me before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? I don’t want to have to wait weeks and weeks. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. It’s just… nice to feel like someone is actually trying to help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. I'm glad I could listen. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. My staff will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. We’ll discuss the results together, and we’ll create a plan to help you feel like yourself again. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here’s the form for the lab. Just take this to the front desk, and they’ll direct you. Get some rest, Ms. Licano. I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
