DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, at my age, things just…start to feel a bit worn out, you know? I suppose I’m looking for a little…revitalization. A jumpstart, if you will. I want to feel more like myself again, and have the energy to enjoy my days. It’s not one specific thing, just a general feeling of…needing a reset.
DOCTOR: “Revitalization,” you say. At 87, that’s…ambitious. While I appreciate a positive outlook, Ms. McNabb, we need to be precise. “Feeling worn out” is quite vague. Let’s attempt to quantify this. Can you describe specifically what activities you find yourself struggling with now that you didn't struggle with before?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, Doctor. Ambitious is a good word for it! It's just…everything takes more effort now. I used to love tending my garden – the hibiscus, especially. But bending and kneeling…it’s become quite difficult. And walking to the market, just a few blocks away, leaves me breathless. I used to enjoy a good walk, you see. It wasn't a sprint, mind you, but…a leisurely stroll. Now, I find myself needing to rest halfway. And even just keeping up with my grandchildren...they're so energetic! I don't want to slow them down.
DOCTOR: Garden work, walking, keeping up with grandchildren… alright. So, exertion-related shortness of breath and fatigue. And difficulty with lower extremity movement. Have you noticed any pain associated with this, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Yes, a little pain, Doctor. Mostly in my knees and hips. Not a sharp pain, but more of a dull ache that comes and goes. It's worse after I’ve been on my feet for a while, or after I’ve tried to do something a bit strenuous. It doesn’t keep me up at night, thankfully, but it’s certainly…present. It's just a general discomfort, really. And sometimes, my hands feel a bit stiff, especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee and hip pain, exacerbated by activity, with morning stiffness in the hands. Do you have any difficulty with grip strength?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I suppose I do, now that you mention it. Opening jars can be a bit tricky. And sometimes I struggle with the lids on those plastic containers. Not every time, but more often than I used to. My daughter helps me with those stubborn ones, bless her heart. It’s not a major problem, but it's noticeable.
DOCTOR: I see. So, we have exertion-related fatigue and shortness of breath, knee and hip pain with activity, and now difficulty with grip strength and opening containers. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. My ankles sometimes swell up at the end of the day, especially if it’s been particularly warm. Not terribly noticeable, but I can tell my shoes feel a bit tighter. And occasionally, my fingers will look a little puffy. It usually goes down overnight if I elevate my feet, but it's something I've noticed.
DOCTOR: Alright. We are accumulating quite a list. Before we proceed, Ms. McNabb, I must ask: do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for many years now. And I had a mild bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that…nothing major that I can recall. My doctor always said I was quite robust, for my age! I try to eat well, though I do have a fondness for guava cake.
DOCTOR: “Robust” is a relative term, Ms. McNabb. High blood pressure, controlled with medication. And pneumonia a few years ago. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see…oh dear, I always forget these things. My daughter reminds me every morning! It’s…Lisinopril, I believe. And a water pill, too. Something with a “thiazide” in the name? I’m so sorry, Doctor. I really should write these things down. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and a thiazide diuretic. Excellent. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything. I used to get hives as a child, but those disappeared long ago. I am fortunate in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath…and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Certainly. Deep breath…and exhale.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds regular, but there is a slight S1 gallop. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, let’s examine your knees and hips. Can you bend your knees for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Oh, there we go. A little creaky, if I may say so. It's not a smooth bend, you know. And it's a bit tender on the inside of my right knee.
DOCTOR: Mild crepitus with knee flexion, tenderness to palpation of the medial joint line of the right knee. Range of motion limited to 90 degrees bilaterally. Now, let's examine your hips. Can you rotate your hips inward and outward?
PATIENT: Alright. Oh, yes. There we go… inward… and outward. It feels a little…restricted, Doctor. Not painful, but not as free-moving as it used to be. It’s more difficult on the left side, I think.
DOCTOR: Mild restriction of hip range of motion bilaterally, with greater limitation on the left. No tenderness to palpation. Now, let's check your reflexes and strength.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Reflexes 2+ and symmetric throughout. Strength 5/5 in upper extremities. Lower extremities exhibit 4/5 strength bilaterally. Now, I would like to order some blood work and an X-ray of your knees and hips. This will help us to determine the cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…thorough, Doctor. Very good. Blood work and X-rays… yes, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I should do to prepare for those? And when can I expect to hear back about the results?
DOCTOR: For the blood work, fast for 12 hours beforehand—no food or drink other than water. The X-rays require no preparation. The results typically take 24-48 hours to return. I will have my assistant contact you with the findings. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Do you have any further questions, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Fasting and no strenuous activity… I can manage that. Thank you for your thorough examination and for taking the time to listen to me. It’s reassuring to have a plan of action. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will escort you to schedule your blood work and X-rays. Have a good day, Ms. McNabb. .
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. Have a good day to you too. . .
