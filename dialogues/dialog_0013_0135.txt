DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is nice to meet you also. I am here because… how you say… my ear is leaking. It started maybe three days ago. A little water come out. Not much, but it is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, “leaking” from the ear for about three days. Not a large amount, but bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… difficult to explain. It is not pain, exactly. More like… a feeling. A wet feeling, inside. And sometimes, I hear a little… ringing. Very soft. It happens more when I lie down. I do not know if this make sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Gerhard. A wet feeling and ringing, especially when lying down… Okay. Have you noticed any pain at all – even a dull ache?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not even a little. Just the wet feeling and the soft ringing. And… sometimes, when I move my head quickly, I feel a little… dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… a little off balance for a moment. Perhaps this is important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, wet feeling, ringing, and occasional dizziness with quick head movements. That is important, thank you for telling me. Have you had any fever, or any trouble with your hearing – like things sounding muffled?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. I check this morning. Everything is normal. And my hearing… well, it is not muffled, but it feels… full. Like something is inside the ear. Not loud, but… present. I have to listen a little harder sometimes to hear clearly. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, “fullness” and needing to listen harder. And you said this started about three days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, three days ago. Wednesday, I think it was. I was… gardening. Pulling weeds. Perhaps something went into my ear then? I do not remember, but maybe. I do not use ear plugs. It was a warm day. I was sweating. It is difficult to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gardening on Wednesday, warm day, sweating… potentially something entering the ear. Have you tried to clean it out at all, or put anything in your ear?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not put anything in my ear. My mother always said it is dangerous. I try to wipe the outside with a cloth, but I do not go inside. I do not have any… tools for that. Just the cloth. I fear to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s wise to be cautious. Okay. I’m going to take a quick look at your ear with an otoscope. It won’t take long, and it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will tell you if it hurt. I trust you. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerhard. I’ve taken a look. Your ear canal is a little red and there’s some earwax present. Your eardrum looks okay – it’s a little cloudy, but doesn't have any holes or obvious damage. It doesn’t appear like anything is stuck in there, but the cloudiness and redness suggest some inflammation. This could be due to a mild ear infection, or irritation from the earwax.
PATIENT: Inflammation? Infection? Is this serious, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing? I need my hearing for my work. I teach. I must be able to hear the students.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's not jump to conclusions. It’s unlikely you'll lose your hearing. Most ear infections and inflammation are easily treatable. The cloudiness I saw could be from fluid build-up, which is common with minor infections. To be sure, I’d like to check your hearing briefly with a simple test. It's just listening for tones through headphones. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. I will listen for the tones. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, tell me if it is a bad infection. I worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, Gerhard. The hearing test shows a slight reduction in hearing in the lower frequencies, which is consistent with some fluid or inflammation in the middle ear. Nothing dramatic, but it explains why you've been feeling like things are muffled. I suspect you have a mild middle ear infection, likely caused by some irritation and a bit of fluid build-up.
PATIENT: Mild infection… is this from the gardening, you think? And the sweating? What will we do about it, Doctor? Do I need… pills? Or drops? Will it take long to heal? I have students waiting for me. I do not wish to be sick long.
DOCTOR: It's very possible the gardening triggered it – sweat can create a warm, moist environment for bacteria, and something could have irritated the ear canal. As for treatment, I'm going to recommend a course of oral antibiotics – a short course, just to clear up the infection. I’m also going to prescribe some ear drops to help with the inflammation and hopefully drain any fluid. It typically takes about a week to see improvement with antibiotics and ear drops, but it's important to finish the entire course even if you start feeling better sooner. It's also good to avoid getting water in your ear for the next few days. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I have no problems with pills or drops. I understand, finish the whole course. No water in the ear. This is good. Will the drops… burn? I do not like burning. And what if it does not get better? What then?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about no allergies. The ear drops shouldn't burn, but you might feel a slight coolness or tingling sensation when you first put them in. If it's painful burning, let me know immediately. And if it doesn't improve within a week, or if your symptoms get worse – increased pain, fever, or drainage – we'll need to re-evaluate. It's possible you might need a referral to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for further investigation. But let's start with the antibiotics and drops, and see how you respond. Here’s your prescription and instructions for the antibiotics and ear drops. It also includes information about potential side effects. Do you have any questions about anything before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand everything. Finish the pills, use the drops, keep the ear dry. And come back if it gets worse. Thank you very much for your help. You have been very patient with me. I worry easily.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. It’s perfectly normal to worry, and I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns at all, even if it's just a small question. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, and I’ll see you if needed.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Good day to you.
