DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, my memory has been… not as good lately. It worries me, you see. I do not… forget everything, but small things. Important things, sometimes. And my blood pressure is… high. My husband, God rest his soul, always said I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. It’s completely understandable to be worried about changes in your memory, and high blood pressure is definitely something we want to address. So, you’ve noticed a decline in your memory recently. Can you tell me a little more about what kind of things you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… frustrating. For example, just yesterday, I went to the market for milk and… I completely forgot what else I needed! I had a list, I know I did. But when I got there… nothing. Also, names. People I see regularly, friends from the community association… their names escape me. It is… embarrassing. I used to remember everything. Dates, details… everything. And, as I said, this started around the same time my blood pressure went up, perhaps? I do not know the connection, if there is one.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting items on a list and difficulty recalling names… that’s helpful to know. It is possible there’s a connection to your blood pressure, though memory issues can have many causes. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me roughly when you first started noticing these memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… a difficult question. It was… gradual. Perhaps six months ago? No, maybe a little longer. Around the time of my husband’s… anniversary. November, I think. Yes, November of 2024. It was subtle then. Misplacing keys, forgetting appointments. Now… it is more frequent. And I find myself repeating questions to people, because I… I simply cannot recall if they answered me already. It is… unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting around November 2024, gradually worsening memory issues… that gives us a good timeframe. You mentioned repeating questions. Are you noticing this happen often?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… more frequent than I would like. Especially with my neighbors. We discuss the community garden, the landscaping… and I will ask the same question two or three times in a short period. They are very polite, thankfully. But I know it is because I cannot remember their answer. It makes me anxious, you see. I fear… what is happening to me. Is it… something serious? I have no family left, you understand. My husband was everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Venus, and it’s completely valid to be concerned. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. We’ll figure this out together. To get a more complete picture, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or behavior since November?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. Let me think. I… I do not sleep as well. I wake often, thinking about… things. Small things, mostly. The garden, the association meetings. And sometimes I feel… a little lost, even in my own home. It is a strange sensation. Like I am… observing myself, rather than being myself. It is difficult to explain. And I have less patience, I think. I snap at people more easily. Something I never did before. My husband always said I was a very calm woman. It is… disturbing.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep, feeling lost or detached, and increased irritability… that’s all important information. And you said this irritability is a change for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A significant change. I always prided myself on my composure. Even when things were difficult, I could remain calm. Now… small things upset me. A misplaced item, a late reply to an email… things that never bothered me before. I find myself… frustrated very easily. And I apologize to people often, because of it. It is… uncharacteristic. I do not like this new… me. It is very upsetting. Is this… something to do with the blood pressure, perhaps?
DOCTOR: It could be related to the blood pressure, Venus, but those symptoms can have many causes. We need to investigate further to get a clear picture. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have… arthritis. In my hands and knees. It is… uncomfortable, but manageable with medication. And I had a… a hysterectomy many years ago. Perhaps twenty years, now? It was… routine, at the time. No complications. Otherwise… no. I do not take many medications. Just a mild pain reliever for the arthritis, as needed. And I… I do not drink alcohol. Never have. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner, but I always preferred tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis managed with medication, a hysterectomy twenty years ago, and no alcohol use… that’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have taken many medications over the years, for various ailments. A cold, a flu… and I have never had an allergic reaction. I did… have a reaction to a bee sting once, as a child. But that was… many years ago. And it was treated quickly. Otherwise… no allergies. I am… remarkably healthy, for my age, aside from the arthritis and the blood pressure, of course. It is just this… memory. It worries me so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, just a bee sting reaction as a child. And we’ve talked about your current symptoms and medical history. Let's talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Were there any instances of memory problems or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is… a difficult question. My parents… they both passed away when I was young. A fever, I believe. And I… I did not know my grandparents. My husband’s mother… she was… a little forgetful in her old age, perhaps. But it was dismissed as… simply being old. No one spoke of… dementia, or anything serious. His father… he was very sharp, right until the end. So… no. As far as I know, there is no family history of memory problems. It is… disconcerting, to be the first, perhaps? It makes me worry even more. Is this… something I inherited, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of dementia or significant memory problems. It's not necessarily inherited, Venus. Many factors can contribute to memory issues. Now, one last thing about your history before we move on to a physical exam. Can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. I live alone, as I said. My husband… he passed away five years ago. I keep busy, though. I am very active in the community association. We organize events, maintain the garden… it keeps me occupied. I walk every day, for exercise. And I read… a great deal. I enjoy mysteries, mostly. I cook for myself, of course. And I… I have a few friends I see occasionally. We have tea, discuss local events… it is… a quiet life, but a comfortable one. I do not travel much. My husband… he enjoyed traveling, but I always preferred to stay close to home. I do not smoke, as I said. And I… I do not have any pets. It is just… me. It has been… lonely, since he passed away, but I manage. Is this… helpful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Venus. It sounds like you’re a very active and engaged person, despite your loss. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I understand. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My blood pressure has been… elevated lately, as you know. Perhaps that is the root of the problem. I am ready when you are. Please, do not hesitate to ask if you need any further information. I want to… resolve this, if possible. I simply want to… feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. It might be a little cold, just a heads up. Deep breaths for me, please. "Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur. We should keep an eye on that. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure." "Blood pressure is 148 over 92. That is elevated, as you know."
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My husband always worried about my blood pressure. He said I needed to… slow down. I suppose he was right. I do not feel any… discomfort, though. Just… a little tired, perhaps. Is that murmur… serious? It is… unsettling to hear something is not quite right. And the tiredness… it is not new, but it has been… more pronounced lately. I suppose it is all connected, perhaps. What happens next, Doctor? Will you be… taking blood samples? Or perhaps a… scan of my brain? I am… prepared for whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. The murmur is something we'll want to monitor. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's good to have a baseline. Now, let’s check your reflexes and coordination. I’m going to ask you to do a few simple things – follow my finger with your eyes, touch your nose with your finger, and walk a few steps. "Just follow my finger with your eyes, don't move your head." "Good. Now, can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Now, my nose… Is that… satisfactory, Doctor? I do not want to… disappoint you. I am… perhaps not as nimble as I once was. It is… disconcerting to feel my body… failing me, if only a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. It’s okay, you’re doing fine. It’s just a quick assessment. "Now, can you walk a few steps forward for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that… adequate, Doctor? I feel… a little foolish, perhaps. I am not as steady on my feet as I once was. It is… unsettling to feel my body… failing me, if only a little. I am… perhaps not as graceful as I once was. It is… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. That’s perfectly alright. It's good we're getting a baseline of how things are now. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there’s some mild hesitation, but nothing immediately concerning. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I think it’s a good idea to order some blood work. Just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I’d also like to schedule a brain scan – an MRI – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It will help us rule out anything structural, and give us more information to work with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood work and a scan… whatever you think is necessary. I want to… resolve this, if possible. I want to… feel like myself again. I… trust your judgment. An MRI… is it… painful? And will the results… take long to come back? I… worry about waiting. And I… have no family, you understand. No one to… accompany me to the scan. It is… unsettling to go through this alone. But I… trust you, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. The MRI is not painful at all. You'll lie inside a scanner, and it makes some loud noises, but it's completely safe. You’ll have headphones to wear, and a technician will be right there with you the whole time. It takes about 30-40 minutes. The results will take a few days to come back, usually 3-5 business days. And don’t worry about going alone – we can arrange for one of our nurses to accompany you, if you’d like. We don’t want you to feel anxious. In the meantime, let’s talk about some things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Have you tried keeping a daily journal?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A nurse… that would be… very kind. I… appreciate your thoughtfulness. A journal… no, I have not. I… never thought of that. I suppose it could… help me remember things. And perhaps… track my symptoms. I… trust your judgment. What else can I do? I… worry about… forgetting important things. Appointments, names… things I should remember. Is there… medication that can help? Or exercises I can do? I… simply want to… feel like myself again. It is… disconcerting to feel my mind… slipping away, if only a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. Keeping a journal is a great first step. Write down everything you do, even seemingly unimportant things. It can help you jog your memory and identify patterns. And there are also some simple memory exercises you can do. Things like crosswords, Sudoku, or even just trying to recall a list of items. There are some medications that can help with memory, but they're generally reserved for more severe cases, like Alzheimer’s disease. Right now, we're still trying to figure out what's going on. In the meantime, let's focus on managing your blood pressure. That's something we can address immediately. I want you to start a low-sodium diet, and try to get regular exercise – at least 30 minutes of walking most days of the week. We can also discuss medication options to help lower your blood pressure, if necessary. Would you like me to write down some information about low-sodium diets and exercise?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… very helpful. A list of foods… and exercises. Anything to help me… manage this. And perhaps… slow things down. I… worry about… forgetting everything. It is… unsettling. And slowing things down… sounds… sensible. Low sodium… I believe my husband… he always worried about my salt intake. I suppose I should… listen to him, even now. And the exercises… walking sounds… manageable. Perhaps I should… walk with the nurse, when I go for the scan. It is… unsettling to go alone. Thank you, Doctor. For your… thoughtfulness. And for your… patience. It is… disconcerting to feel so… lost.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. Here you go. This has some good information about foods to avoid and some simple exercises you can start with. And absolutely, we can arrange for the nurse to accompany you to the scan. Don’t worry about a thing. We're going to figure this out together, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Together… that sounds… reassuring. I… trust your judgment. Thank you… for your… patience. And for your… kindness. It is… disconcerting to feel so… lost. But… together… that sounds… sensible. Is there… anything else I should be doing? Or… anything else I should be… worrying about? It is… difficult to… feel like myself again. But… together… that sounds… sensible. I think… I think that is all for now, Doctor. Thank you. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. For now, just focus on keeping a journal, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll talk again when the test results come back, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A journal… a healthy diet… exercise… and call… if I… worry. That sounds… sensible. Thank you… for everything. Together… that sounds… sensible. Good day, Doctor. .
