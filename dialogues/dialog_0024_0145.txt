DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here, if you will, to discuss the possibility of home health, or… hospice care. I believe that is what my daughter arranged. She said something about a certification.
DOCTOR: A certification, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. She explained it would be… necessary, to allow for services to begin. I confess, I am not entirely certain of the details. She handles most of these things, you see. It is for my recovery, after the… operation. Though, recovery is proving… difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s access your electronic health record here… Operation, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. On my hip, Doctor. A replacement, actually. It was… quite some time ago, now. March, I believe. But it has not healed as expected. There is… discomfort. And limitations. My daughter is quite concerned, and suggested we explore options for care at home. Is this the correct procedure? I am afraid I do not wish to trouble anyone unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: March, you say… A hip replacement. And you are experiencing… discomfort. Could you be more specific about this discomfort, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Specific… well, it is a pain, of course. A dull ache, mostly, but it can become… sharp at times. Especially when I try to… move. Walking is difficult. And sleeping. I find myself… restless, because of the pain. It is not constant, but it is… persistent. And it interferes with… everything. My daughter says it is affecting my quality of life. I do not doubt her, of course. But I would like to understand… what the options are.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, sharp with movement… interferes with sleep and walking. And your daughter has expressed concern. Has there been any fever, redness, or swelling around the surgical site?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No redness, and certainly no swelling. It is… simply pain. A deep ache. And the… inability to do things. I used to enjoy gardening, you see. But now… even standing for a short time is… challenging. I apologize for rambling. I am not accustomed to discussing these… ailments in such detail.
DOCTOR: Rambling is perfectly acceptable, Mr. Bahta. Now, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of that nature. I have always been… quite healthy, actually. A little arthritis in my hands, perhaps, as one gets older. But nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just… this hip. And the… difficulties it presents. My general practitioner always said I had a strong constitution. He retired last year, unfortunately. I have not yet found a replacement.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, besides perhaps something for arthritis?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of ibuprofen, Doctor. For the arthritis, and occasionally for the hip, when the pain is… particularly troublesome. Nothing else. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, you see. I believe in… natural remedies, when appropriate. Though, I confess, ibuprofen is proving… insufficient at this point.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… insufficient. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I have always been able to… tolerate most things. My daughter did ask me to confirm this recently, just to be certain, before arranging any… home care. She is very… thorough. I appreciate her concern, naturally. But it does mean… a lot of questions. And I sometimes struggle to… recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, a quick social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My wife… she was very firm about that. And it is… a sensible habit, I suppose. She passed away five years ago, you see. It was… sudden. But she always encouraged… a healthy lifestyle. And I have tried to… maintain that, as best I can. Though, these… recent difficulties have made that… challenging.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to assess your hip and range of motion.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you would be so kind as to direct me. I apologize. It is… a little difficult to move, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Just lie down, Mr. Bahta. We need to see the extent of the limitation. Alright… there is definite tenderness here. And your range of motion is… limited, as expected. Flexion is restricted to approximately 90 degrees. Extension… also limited. And there is some guarding present. It appears there may be some capsular tightness. And possibly some residual inflammation.
PATIENT: It is… uncomfortable, Doctor. As you can see. I try to… be stoic, but it is… a persistent ache. Capsular tightness? Inflammation? What does that… imply? Is it something… serious? My daughter mentioned… the possibility of further surgery. Which… I am rather hoping to avoid.
DOCTOR: Further surgery is… a possibility, yes. However, let us not jump to conclusions. The capsular tightness indicates that the tissues around the hip joint are restricted, limiting your range of motion. The inflammation suggests that there is still some irritation present. Now, I am going to order some blood work, just to rule out any other underlying causes. And I'd like a hip X-ray to assess the implant position and bone health. We need to see what is happening beneath the surface. This is standard procedure, Mr. Bahta. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Blood work and an X-ray. To… assess the situation. And to… rule out anything further. I confess, I am not entirely comfortable with the idea of… further intervention. But I trust your judgment, naturally. And I appreciate you… explaining the procedure. Is there anything… I should be aware of regarding the blood work? Do I need to… fast beforehand? Or avoid any particular… medications? My daughter usually handles these details, you see. But she is… unavailable at the moment.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. And please continue taking your ibuprofen as needed. Now, I will have my nurse schedule these tests for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. It may involve physical therapy, injections, or, as you mentioned, further surgery. We'll proceed cautiously, Mr. Bahta. And I assure you, we will explore all available options before resorting to anything drastic. Now, do you have any further questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers… everything for the moment. Fasting for twelve hours, and continue with the ibuprofen. And await the results of the… tests. I… appreciate your time and… explanation. And I trust your judgment, naturally. Perhaps… a little physical therapy would be… beneficial. If that is… appropriate. Thank you again, Doctor. I believe that is all.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule those tests and provide further instructions. I'll review the results as soon as they are available. And we will discuss the possibility of physical therapy at that time. Have a good day, Mr. Bahta. And please, try to rest.
