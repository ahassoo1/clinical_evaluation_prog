DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have…problem with my ear. It is…leaking. A little bit of water comes out, sometimes. It started maybe two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of leakage from your ear for about two weeks. I see. Can you describe the leakage a bit more?
PATIENT: It is…clear. Not blood. And not…thick. Like water, yes? Sometimes a little bit smelly, but not always. It is very small amount. I wipe it with cloth.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear, watery discharge, sometimes with a slight odor, and you've noticed it for about two weeks now, wiping it away with a cloth. Hmm. Does it happen all the time, or are there specific times or situations when it's more likely to leak?
PATIENT: It happens…when it is hot. Or when I sweat. If I exercise, for example. Or if I am very warm. Also…sometimes after I shower. I think when water goes in my ear. Not all the time, though. Some days, nothing happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to heat, sweating, and possibly water getting into your ear. Do you experience any pain, fullness, or hearing changes along with the leakage?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. And…fullness? No, I don’t think so. Hearing is…normal. I can hear everything like always. Maybe a little quiet when the water is inside, but that goes away quickly. It is…difficult to explain. Everything sounds usual.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain, hearing seems normal, maybe a slight temporary muffling when fluid is present. Have you had any ear infections in the past that you're aware of, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was young, maybe…ten years old? I remember being very sick. Doctor gave me drops for ear. And then it got better. I do not remember if I have had any other problems with my ear. It has been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of an ear infection as a child. That’s good to know. And have you ever injured your ear – perhaps a knock to the head or something similar?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been careful. I work with…books. Mostly sitting. No running or fighting! I have never hit my head. Or had anything go in my ear, like a stick. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No recent injury. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am…healthy man. I walk every day, I eat good food. My doctor…old doctor, before, he said I was fine. A little bit of…weight, yes, but he said that was okay. No other problems. No diabetes. No high…what you say? Blood pressure? No.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, a little bit of extra weight according to your previous doctor, but no known diabetes or high blood pressure. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I do not like taking pills. Sometimes…when my knees hurt, I take something for pain. But that is…rare. Only when I walk too much. Otherwise, I do not take anything. Just water and food.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never. I eat everything. I have tried many foods. Fish, meat, vegetables…everything is okay. My wife…old wife, she had allergies, but not me. Never had a problem. I can eat peanuts, also. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never. My father…he smoked, but I did not like it. Smelled very bad. And my wife…she did not like it, either. No, I have never touched a cigarette.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. Very little. When I eat with friends, I will have a small glass of wine. Or sometimes beer. But…not every day. Maybe once a week, or two weeks. Just a little. I do not drink much.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol use. Now, finally, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like hearing loss, ear problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: My mother…she had problems with her heart. Old age, Doctor said. And my brother…he had diabetes, yes. But he did not take care of himself. He ate too much sugar. And my father…he did not have any problems, as far as I know. Nobody in my family…ear problems. Nobody. Just heart and diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease and diabetes. Thank you, Mr. Radillo, that’s very helpful. Now, would you mind if I take a quick look at your ears with an otoscope?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Please look. I want to know what is wrong. I hope it is not…serious. But I trust you. Please look at my ears. Carefully, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Radillo. I will be as gentle as possible. It will just take a moment. Please lean forward a little. Alright, I see a little bit of cerumen – earwax – but nothing blocking the ear canal. The ear drum appears intact, and I don't see any signs of infection. However, there is a small amount of clear fluid visible on the ear drum itself. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it could be a small perforation, or fluid buildup behind the eardrum. Do you feel any pressure in your ear right now?
PATIENT: Perforation? What is that, Doctor? Is that…bad? Pressure? No, I do not feel any pressure. Everything feels usual. Maybe…a little bit of quiet sound sometimes. Like…wind. But not all the time. Is it serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: A perforation is a small hole in the eardrum. It doesn’t always require treatment, but it can sometimes cause hearing loss or infection. From what you're describing about the intermittent quiet sound like wind, it sounds like it could be a small perforation, but we need to confirm that. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a tympanometry test - it's a simple hearing test that measures how your eardrum moves. This will help us see if there's a hole or fluid buildup. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: A test? Yes, Doctor. I can do a test. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is wrong. Fluid buildup…that sounds bad. Is it serious if it is fluid? Will I lose my hearing? I need to hear, Doctor. I like to read my books. A test is okay. When can we do it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. Fluid buildup can sometimes lead to hearing loss, but it doesn’t always, and it's often treatable. We won’t know until we get the test results. The tympanometry test is very quick and painless, just a small probe placed in your ear. Our audiologist is available this afternoon. Would 2:30 PM work for you?
PATIENT: Two thirty…yes, that is okay. I will be here. And…what if it is a hole? What happens then, Doctor? Will I need…surgery? I am old man. I do not want surgery. I just want to read my books. Tell me the truth, Doctor. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, 2:30 PM it is. Now, regarding the hole, Mr. Radillo, most small perforations heal on their own within a few weeks to months with proper care – keeping your ear dry, avoiding getting water in it, and perhaps a topical antibiotic ear drop to prevent infection. Surgery is rarely needed. If it doesn’t heal on its own, or if it’s a larger perforation, we’d discuss options like a tympanoplasty - a surgery to repair the eardrum. But, again, that’s a less common scenario. Right now, it's important not to jump to conclusions. Let’s get the test results first, and then we can discuss the best course of action for you. To help prevent any issues, I'll also advise you to avoid getting any water in your ear until we know more. Do you swim, or do you shower frequently?
PATIENT: I do not swim, Doctor. Never. I do not like water. But I shower every day. I must be clean. Is showering bad? If it is bad, I do not know what to do. I need to be clean. Can I still wash my hair? This is difficult. I do not want to get sick. Perhaps I should just…not shower?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. You don’t need to stop showering completely. However, for the next few days until we have the test results, please try to avoid getting water inside your ear canal when you shower. You can use a cotton ball with a small amount of petroleum jelly on it to gently block the ear canal before showering. Be careful not to push it in too far! And be careful not to force the water in. Washing your hair is fine, as long as you avoid getting water inside your ear. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Cotton ball…petroleum jelly. Block the ear canal. Be careful. No water inside. I understand. It sounds…difficult. But I will try. Is there anything else I should do? Should I avoid loud noises? I like to listen to music sometimes. Soft music. But is that bad now?
DOCTOR: That’s right, you’re doing great. Avoiding loud noises isn’t necessary at this point, but perhaps lower the volume just a little until we know what’s going on, just to be safe. And avoid poking anything into your ear – no cotton swabs, hairpins, or anything like that. We'll get a better understanding after the tympanometry test. It’s quick, painless, and will help us decide on the best course of action. I will write you a prescription for a small amount of antibiotic ear drops, just in case. It is better to be prepared. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Antibiotic ear drops…okay. Prepare. I think…no, no more questions now. I am little bit nervous. But I will try the cotton ball and be careful. I trust you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. Two thirty, yes? With the audiologist?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It’s understandable to be a little nervous, but we're taking things one step at a time. Yes, 2:30 PM with the audiologist. They will call you back when they are ready. They’re very nice and will explain the test procedure. If you experience any sudden pain, fever, or drainage from your ear before your appointment, please call the clinic immediately. Otherwise, please try to relax and follow the instructions we discussed. I will see you after the test results come in. Have a good afternoon, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will be careful. Two thirty. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Goodbye, and take care. I’ll see you this afternoon.
