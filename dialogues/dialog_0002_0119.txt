DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's... rather embarrassing, to be frank. It's a personal matter, you see. But I suppose that's why one comes to a doctor, isn't it? It concerns... a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, I must add. From my… husband. Though, well, he couldn’t be bothered to come himself. Said it was “too much trouble.” Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright. These things happen, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's not embarrassing at all to discuss health concerns with me. So, this discharge is from your husband… and when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, it's good of you to say so, Doctor. Some people wouldn’t be so understanding. It started… oh, goodness. Let me think. It must be… perhaps a week ago? Maybe a little longer. He didn’t mention it at first, of course. Men. They just ignore things until they become absolutely… unavoidable. It was after… a visit with that woman down the street, I believe. The one with the rather… loud laugh. Does that make any difference?
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a week ago, and you mentioned it occurred after a visit with someone. That information could be relevant, yes. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must I? It's… it's not a pleasant sight, Doctor. It’s… yellowish, I think. And… a bit thick. Not watery, certainly. And there’s… a smell. A rather… unappealing smell. It’s not like anything I’ve ever encountered before, thankfully. He’s been trying to keep it… contained, but it’s hardly discreet, is it? It's just... vulgar, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, thick, and with an unpleasant odor. I appreciate you being so detailed, even if it's uncomfortable to talk about. Has he experienced any pain, burning, or itching along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, he grumbled a bit. Said it felt… tender, he said. Not screaming or anything, mind you. Just… grumbling. And itching, perhaps? He's always scratching. Though, to be honest, he scratches regardless. He’s a nervous man, you see. Always fidgeting. I suppose it could be related. Honestly, it’s difficult to tell what’s normal with him. He’s rather… unrestrained, shall we say?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tenderness and possible itching. And you said he’s always scratching, so it's hard to tell if that's new. Has he had any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't believe so. He hasn’t complained of feeling cold or hot. And body aches? He’s always aching somewhere. He has a bad back, you see, from… well, from various activities. I doubt that’s related. He’s just a… a fragile man, despite appearances. He fusses over every little thing. No, definitely no fever or chills. Though he did seem a bit more irritable than usual this morning. Is that significant?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, but a bit more irritable. That could be related, or simply a normal fluctuation. And to clarify, this is a new discharge, correct?
PATIENT: Of course it’s new, Doctor! Why would I be bringing him in about something old? Honestly. It started about a week ago, as I said. He's never experienced anything like this before. Though, knowing his… habits, I wouldn’t entirely rule out the possibility of something similar occurring in the past, unbeknownst to me. But this is new. At least, new to me. It's most upsetting.
DOCTOR: Of course, you're right to clarify. I just like to be thorough. Okay, new discharge, yellowish, thick, with an odor, some tenderness, and increased irritability. I'm going to ask a few questions about his medical history, if that's alright. Does he have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or a history of sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… is a difficult question, Doctor. He’s not… forthcoming about such things. He always says a gentleman doesn’t discuss such… intimacies with others. He has a bad back, as I mentioned. And high blood pressure, I believe. He takes pills for it. As for… other things… well, let’s just say he’s had a… colorful past. He was a sailor in his youth, you see. A very restless sailor. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s encountered… various ailments over the years. But he’s never told me anything specifically. It’s terribly frustrating. I suspect he'd rather not dwell on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, a history of being a sailor, and potentially some past medical issues he hasn’t disclosed. That gives me a little something to work with. Does he have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. He once had a rash after eating shellfish, I think. But he eats shellfish all the time now. Perhaps he grew immune. And he complains about feeling drowsy after taking sleeping pills, but that hardly seems like an allergy. As for other medications… well, he takes those pills for his blood pressure, as I said. And occasionally something for his back pain. He gets them from… a friend, I believe. I’m not entirely sure what they are. He doesn’t like to discuss these things. Honestly, Doctor, dealing with him is like pulling teeth. He’s a most secretive man. I doubt he’d even remember what he’s taken.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish allergy in the past, takes medication for blood pressure and back pain – source is uncertain. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. I'll need to check his vitals and then, with your permission, I'll need to examine the area in question. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine… him? Oh dear. Well, that is rather indelicate, isn't it? I suppose it’s necessary, if you insist. But please be quick. And discreet. I don’t wish to cause any… unnecessary embarrassment. He’s a sensitive man, you see. And frankly, I’m not entirely comfortable with the idea. But if it’s for his health… very well. But please, be gentle. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns completely. I will be as quick and gentle as possible and maintain complete discretion. We have a private examination room for a reason. I'll start by checking his vitals, and then we can proceed with the exam. If at any point you’re uncomfortable, please let me know and we can stop. First, could you please help me get him to lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. He’s being rather… uncooperative, as usual. Honestly, I don’t know what I’d do without a firm hand. He’s in the waiting room, still grumbling about the whole ordeal. He's wearing that rather loud Hawaiian shirt, I'm afraid. And his trousers are… well, let’s just say they’re not exactly in pristine condition. Come along, Doctor. Let’s get this over with as quickly as possible. Honestly, a man of his age… the indignity of it all.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you'll excuse me for just a moment. Mr. Wartick, if you'll follow me, we'll just get you comfortable on the examination table. Dr. Ranjan will be with you shortly. If you could give us a moment, please. I'll let you know if I need anything.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall be right outside. But do hurry. Honestly, the whole thing is most unsettling. And please, be mindful of his… sensitivities. He’s a delicate flower, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Wartick. I'm just going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs first. It's a standard part of the exam. Then, with your permission, I'd like to take a closer look at the area in question. Is that alright?
