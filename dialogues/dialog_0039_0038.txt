DOCTOR: Hello Evann, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, I believe I need to arrange some paperwork regarding future care. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… should I be unable to communicate them myself. A friend mentioned an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I confess, the details escape me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very thoughtful of you to plan ahead like that. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both excellent ideas. It sounds like you’re thinking about a healthcare proxy and outlining your wishes for medical care. Now, to be clear, are you currently experiencing any health issues that are prompting this, or is this more of a preventative measure?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it once was. I don't recall any specific health concern that initiated this… urge, if you will. It just felt… prudent. A friend – I believe her name was Anya – she had a difficult experience with her mother, and she strongly recommended I get something in order. So, I suppose it’s preventative, yes. Though I wouldn't be surprised if there was something I'm… overlooking.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's very common for things to slip our minds, and it’s wonderful that you have a friend looking out for you. We can certainly explore this and get everything sorted out. To help me get a better picture of your overall health – just to be thorough – could you tell me a little bit about any past medical conditions you do remember having?
PATIENT: Past conditions… That is difficult. I spent a considerable amount of time traveling when I was younger, and access to consistent medical care was… sporadic. I believe I had a rather severe bout of pneumonia in Mongolia, many years ago. And… I fractured my wrist once, falling from a horse. But beyond that… fragments, mostly. There was a doctor in Ulaanbaatar, I think, but I don’t recall his name. Honestly, it’s all rather… hazy. I apologize for my lack of clarity. Is there a way to access records, perhaps? From previous practitioners?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. It’s perfectly understandable, especially with your travel history. We can absolutely try to access records from previous practitioners. Do you happen to remember the approximate years you were in Mongolia, or any of the hospitals or clinics you might have visited?
PATIENT: That’s… a challenge. I believe it was primarily during the late 1990s and early 2000s. A good portion of my time was spent with nomadic families, away from major cities. When I did visit Ulaanbaatar, I recall a hospital… near the Gandantegchinlen Monastery, perhaps? It was… rather large, and quite busy. I don’t believe I ever established a long-term relationship with a single practitioner. Mostly just… urgent care, when needed. I'm afraid my recollections are quite fragmented, Doctor. It feels like recalling events from a dream.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives us a starting point. We can try searching for hospital records near the Gandantegchinlen Monastery from that period. It might take some time, and there’s no guarantee we’ll find everything, but it’s worth a try. While we're waiting, perhaps we can talk about your current health status. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, or any other symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Currently… no, not particularly. I experience occasional stiffness in my joints, which I attribute to age, mostly. And I do find myself tiring more easily than I used to, but again, that could be simply a result of… well, a life lived. My appetite is normal, and my weight has remained fairly stable. I wouldn't say I’m experiencing any acute symptoms, Doctor. I feel… generally well, for my age. Though I do sometimes feel a… detachment, a sort of… fog. But I suspect that’s more psychological than physical. A lingering effect of… isolation, perhaps. It’s difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. The stiffness and fatigue could be related to normal aging, as you mentioned. And it's not uncommon to experience some cognitive changes with age or life experiences. We can certainly explore that further if it becomes more concerning. Just to get a more comprehensive picture, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't believe I have any severe allergies, thankfully. I recall a mild reaction to certain pollens when I was a child, causing some sneezing and a slightly itchy throat. But nothing life-threatening. And I believe I reacted poorly to a particular insect bite in the Gobi Desert – a rather unpleasant swelling, but it subsided quickly enough. Beyond that… I don't recall any significant allergic reactions. Is there a particular substance I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known severe allergies. That’s helpful. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I make a conscious effort to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer to rely on… natural remedies, and a healthy lifestyle. Though I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as the sunlight is… lacking. But that’s the extent of it. I’ve always been rather cautious about introducing foreign substances into my system. It’s a habit, I suppose. A byproduct of living in remote areas, where access to proper medical care was limited.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a vitamin D supplement occasionally. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a baseline of your current health status. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… acceptable. I understand the need for a thorough assessment. Please, proceed as you deem necessary. I confess, I’ve not had a comprehensive physical examination in quite some time, so I trust your expertise. Perhaps you could explain each step as you go? It would… alleviate any anxieties I may have.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I'm just going to take your blood pressure. This involves wrapping a cuff around your arm and inflating it to briefly stop blood flow, then releasing it to listen for your pulse. It's a standard procedure, completely painless. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 85. That’s slightly elevated, but not cause for immediate concern. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. That’s good. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. That's good. And finally, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Do you have any questions about anything I've done?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The examination has been… uneventful, thankfully. Your explanations were… helpful. It's reassuring to hear that everything seems within normal limits. Though I confess, I don't possess a great deal of medical knowledge, so I'm relying entirely on your assessment. It's all rather… abstract, to be honest. Perhaps we could return to the matter of the Advance Directive now? I’m eager to have that completed, if possible. It would… alleviate a considerable amount of anxiety.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s perfectly understandable. It’s good you’re proactive about this. So, the Advance Directive allows you to appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you’re unable to do so yourself. It also allows you to outline your wishes regarding medical treatment, such as whether you want life-sustaining measures in certain situations. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail, or would you prefer to get started with the paperwork?
PATIENT: Perhaps a brief explanation would be… beneficial, Doctor. I believe I grasp the general concept, but the specifics are… somewhat hazy. Particularly regarding the outlining of my wishes. What sort of scenarios would I need to consider? And what level of detail is required? I confess, the thought of contemplating such matters is… unsettling. But I understand its necessity. A concise overview would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Of course. The scenarios you'd consider fall into a few categories. One is end-of-life care – what kind of treatment you want if you have a terminal illness, such as whether you want to be kept alive on a ventilator or receive aggressive pain management. Another is situations where you're unable to communicate your wishes due to a serious injury or illness – what kind of treatment you want if you're in a coma or have a severe cognitive impairment. As for the level of detail, it's entirely up to you. You can be as specific as you like – outlining exactly which treatments you want or don’t want in certain situations. Or you can be more general – stating your overall values and preferences, such as whether you prioritize quality of life over prolonging life. We have forms that can guide you through the process, with examples of common scenarios and options. We can also discuss your values and preferences in more detail, and I can help you draft a statement that reflects your wishes. Does that sound helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… remarkably helpful, Doctor. The prospect of navigating such complexities independently is… daunting. The guided forms would be greatly appreciated. And your assistance in drafting a statement that reflects my wishes would be… invaluable. I confess, articulating my values and preferences is… challenging. I’ve spent much of my life adapting to… unforeseen circumstances. A fixed declaration feels… restrictive. But I understand its importance. Perhaps we could begin with the forms, and proceed from there? Is there a particular form you recommend as a starting point?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I have the standard Advance Directive form here, and a separate form for specifically outlining your goals of care. We can start with the goals of care form, as that focuses more on your values and preferences, which you mentioned being a bit hesitant about. It's less about specific treatments and more about what's important to you in terms of quality of life. It asks questions like what activities make your life meaningful, what level of pain and discomfort you're willing to tolerate, and what kind of support you want from your healthcare team. Here’s the form. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I’m here to help you through it. We can go through it together, section by section, if you prefer.
PATIENT: This… this is rather comprehensive, Doctor. The questions are… probing. I confess, I’ve not devoted a great deal of thought to… defining what constitutes a “meaningful life.” My priorities have… shifted over time. Perhaps we could proceed section by section, as you suggested. It would… alleviate some of the anxiety. Shall we begin with the first question? It concerns… activities that bring me joy. It seems… a rather daunting place to start.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s perfectly alright. It is a lot to consider, and it's okay to take your time. And yes, let's start with the first question: "What activities bring you joy and make life meaningful?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. In my youth, it was… exploration. Traveling to remote corners of the world, documenting different cultures, immersing myself in new experiences. But that was… a long time ago. As I’ve grown older, my priorities have… shifted. I find… a certain satisfaction in my work, in creating something tangible, something beautiful. The precision of etching, the meticulous detail… it's… calming. And I… I enjoyed gardening, when I had the space. The nurturing aspect, the connection to nature… But that was… before. Now… I find solace in… quiet contemplation, in reading, in listening to music. It’s… a more subdued existence. I suppose… creating beauty, in whatever form it takes, brings me joy. Is that… sufficient? It feels… inadequate, somehow.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful answer, Evann. It's not about grand gestures; it's about what you find meaningful. And "creating beauty, in whatever form it takes" is a beautiful sentiment. It speaks to a deep appreciation for art and the natural world. That’s perfectly sufficient, and it gives me a good understanding of your values. Shall we move on to the next question, which asks about your priorities regarding physical and emotional well-being?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Proceeding seems… logical. Though the thought of quantifying my priorities regarding physical and emotional well-being is… unsettling. It feels… rather clinical. But I understand its necessity. Let me see… “What are your most important goals for your health and well-being?”… This is… a rather open-ended question. I suppose… maintaining my independence is paramount. Being able to care for myself, to continue my work… that is… crucial. And… avoiding unnecessary suffering is… also a high priority. I’ve witnessed enough pain and hardship in my life. I do not wish to endure… prolonged discomfort. Is that… adequate? I confess, I struggle to articulate my feelings with such precision. It feels… reductive.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful answer, Evann. Maintaining your independence and avoiding unnecessary suffering are excellent priorities. Those are goals many people share, and they’re incredibly important. It’s not about being reductive; it's about identifying what you value most. It sounds like you prioritize quality of life, and that's something we can definitely incorporate into your goals of care. The next question asks about your tolerance for pain and discomfort. It can be difficult to think about, but it’s important to understand your preferences. It asks, "What level of pain and discomfort are you willing to tolerate in order to achieve certain goals?
PATIENT: That… that is a particularly difficult question, Doctor. I’ve always had a… low tolerance for pain, to be honest. I’ve never been one to… stoically endure hardship. The thought of prolonged suffering is… deeply unsettling. I believe I would… prioritize comfort over… extended existence, if forced to choose. I do not wish to be a burden on others, nor do I wish to… linger in a state of diminished capacity. I would… prefer a peaceful and dignified end, rather than a protracted struggle. Is that… acceptable? I confess, I struggle to articulate such… personal preferences with such clinical precision. It feels… morbid. Perhaps I should have never agreed to this. It is… dredging up unpleasant memories.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly acceptable, Evann. It takes courage to articulate such personal preferences, and you’re doing a wonderful job. It's not morbid to discuss these things; it's responsible and thoughtful. And it's not dredging up unpleasant memories; it's about ensuring your wishes are respected. It sounds like you prioritize comfort and dignity, and you want to avoid unnecessary suffering. That's something we can absolutely incorporate into your goals of care. Would you like to take a break?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A brief respite would be… appreciated. This is… more emotionally draining than I anticipated. I confess, I’m beginning to feel… overwhelmed. Perhaps we could resume this… another day? I need a moment to… compose myself. The thought of confronting such… existential questions is… unsettling. I apologize for my… emotional fragility. It’s… been a long time since I’ve devoted such concentrated thought to… mortality.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That’s perfectly alright. We can absolutely resume this another day. There’s no need to rush. Your emotional well-being is my priority. Let’s take a break now. Perhaps you’d like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A glass of water would be… most appreciated. Thank you. And… thank you for your… patience. This is… more difficult than I anticipated. But I… I appreciate your assistance. I believe it is… important to have these conversations, however… unsettling they may be. Perhaps, with time and… contemplation, I can articulate my wishes with greater clarity.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed when discussing these things. And you are doing a wonderful job. We can take as much time as you need. Here you are. Take your time, and let me know when you're ready to resume, or if you decide you'd like to schedule another appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I believe… I will schedule another appointment. I need time to… compose my thoughts. Perhaps, with time and… distance, I can articulate my wishes with greater clarity.
