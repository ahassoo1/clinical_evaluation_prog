DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been a bit concerning, so my wife suggested I come get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A mass in the lower abdomen… alright. And how long exactly have you been noticing this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe three, four weeks ago? It wasn't very noticeable at first, just a slight firmness. But it’s definitely grown a bit over the last week or so. It doesn’t really hurt, not constantly, anyway. Just… a bit of discomfort sometimes.
DOCTOR: Discomfort… can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain, Doctor. Not really a sharp pain, more of a… pressure? Like something’s full, or heavy. And sometimes, when I move a certain way, or after I’ve been sitting for a while, it feels a little bit achy. Nothing debilitating, but enough to notice. I haven't had any fever or anything like that, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. This is… completely new to me. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I mean, the usual colds, but nothing major. My wife has been a little worried, to be honest, which is why I’m here. She’s very attentive to these things.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s always good to be proactive. Let's get a bit of your medical background, then. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’m not on any regular medications at all, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that’s it. I’m generally a very healthy eater, mostly Mediterranean foods, things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. And what about past medical history?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had chickenpox when I was a child, of course, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, when I was younger, but that healed completely. Otherwise, I haven’t had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I had all my vaccinations as a kid, too, as far as my mother can remember. I haven’t really needed to go to the doctor much over the years, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family… any history of cancer, abdominal issues, or anything similar on either side?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… My father had high blood pressure, and my mother has arthritis, but nothing about cancer, as far as I know. My paternal grandmother… she had some stomach problems, I think, but it was a long time ago, and I don't know the details. I wouldn’t say there’s a strong family history of anything like this, no. I'm not even sure if she had cancer, just a bad stomach. It's quite a distant memory now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, let’s get some basic measurements. I'll need to check your vital signs, and then we'll do a physical examination of your abdomen. Just to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. If you could just step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: 129 pounds. And your height is 160 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, 160 centimeters. I haven’t been on a scale in a while, so it’s good to have an accurate number.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Alright, let’s move on to the abdominal exam. Please lie down on the examination table for me. I’m going to palpate your abdomen to see if I can locate the mass and assess its characteristics. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Please let me know if you need me to adjust my position at all. I'll try to stay relaxed. I’m a choreographer, so I’m used to being aware of my body, but… I’ll let you guide me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m starting in the upper quadrants… and moving down. Can you tell me where exactly you’ve been feeling this mass?
PATIENT: It’s… lower down, on my right side, mostly. Not directly on the hip bone, but a few inches in. It's not easy to pinpoint exactly, but that's the general area. It feels… firm, but not rock hard, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's some mild tenderness here, as you mentioned. The mass itself… it's approximately 5 centimeters in diameter, firm, and slightly mobile. No rebound tenderness, thankfully. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. Now, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. And I'd also like to schedule an abdominal ultrasound to get a better visualization of the mass. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very thorough. Blood work and an ultrasound seem sensible, yes. Absolutely acceptable. When would I be able to schedule the ultrasound? And will the blood work be done here, or do I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: The blood work can be drawn right here in the clinic after this consultation. We can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning at 9 AM. It’s a non-invasive procedure, and it should give us a clearer picture of what we're dealing with. Based on your age and the findings so far, it could be a number of things. It is likely benign, but we must rule out more serious possibilities. It's important to be thorough, even if it turns out to be nothing.
PATIENT: I understand completely, Doctor. Being thorough is the right approach, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Tomorrow at 9 AM sounds good to me. Should I prepare in any way for the ultrasound? And… is there anything I should be avoiding in the meantime?
DOCTOR: No special preparation is needed for the ultrasound. You can eat and drink normally. Just try to relax and avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. And, honestly, try not to worry too much. Most abdominal masses are benign. But we will have a definite answer tomorrow after the scan. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now, and then you can schedule a follow-up appointment with my assistant. Do you have any other questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your time. I'll go see the lab technician now, then. And I'll schedule the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab is just down the hall to your left. We'll see you tomorrow at 9 AM. .
