DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s…it’s my stomach, mostly. I get full real quick now, even if I don’t eat much. It's been happening for a few weeks, I'd say. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest. It just…gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, for the past few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's not like a painful full, you know? More like… uncomfortable. Like I've eaten a big meal when I've barely touched my plate. And it doesn't matter what I eat, really. Soup, a little bit of fish… doesn’t seem to make a difference. It just…stops me. I used to enjoy a good plate of food, but now… not so much. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of an uncomfortable fullness rather than painful, and it happens regardless of what you eat. That’s helpful. Does this happen with every meal, or is it more common at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Pretty much every meal, Doctor. Breakfast, lunch, dinner… it's all the same. I don't think it’s worse at any particular time, just… always quick. My wife, she keeps offering me seconds, bless her heart, but I really can't manage it. I try to eat a bit slower, thinking maybe that would help, but no luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent with every meal, and slowing down doesn’t seem to make a difference. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been a bit tired lately, now that you mention it. Not like, fall-down tired, but just… lacking energy. And maybe a little bit of heartburn now and then, but I get that sometimes anyway, you know, being an older fella. Nothing too bad. Oh! And I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. A bit constipated, yeah. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, occasional heartburn – which you’ve experienced before – and some constipation. Yes, all of that is important. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really, Doctor. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Had the usual colds and flu, broken a bone or two when I was younger, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble. I used to go to old Doctor MacLeod for checkups, but he retired years ago. He always said I had a strong constitution. My wife keeps on me to see someone regularly, but I always put it off. She’s probably right, though. Just never felt like I needed to. Is this… is this something serious? I’m a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's good you came in now, Mr. Obarr. It's great you haven't had many health problems in the past. While it may not be anything serious, these symptoms do warrant a closer look. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. All natural, you could say! Not even an appendix out or anything. I’ve always been careful, I guess. Mostly just small injuries when I was working. I used to be a fisherman, back in my younger days. A bit rough on the body, but good work, you know? Kept me busy. But no surgeries, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Good question. My mother, she lived to be 92. She was a strong woman, very healthy. My father… he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. My brother, he’s still alive, lives up north, but we don’t see each other much anymore. He’s always been a bit of a loner. He had some stomach issues when he was younger, ulcers, I think, but he never really talked about it much. Just… always kept to himself. I don't know if any of his kids have had similar problems, to be honest. We aren't close.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother lived to 92, your father had heart trouble, and your brother had some stomach issues in the past. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no smoking for me, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she used to smoke a little bit, but she gave it up years ago. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But nothing regular, definitely not. Mostly just water and tea, that's what I drink. And I try to walk a little bit every day, when the weather's good. Nothing strenuous, just a gentle stroll around the neighborhood. Keeping active, you know? Important when you get to my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and you try to stay active. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest. I’ve always believed in letting my body heal itself, you know? Maybe a little bit of vitamin C when I’ve got a cold, but that’s about it. No prescriptions, no regular over-the-counter stuff, no supplements. Plain as can be. My wife tries to get me to take something for my joints, but I refuse. Old age comes with a few aches and pains, you gotta learn to live with 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. No medications or supplements. Just to summarize, you've been experiencing early fullness with meals for a few weeks, along with fatigue and constipation. You have no significant past medical history, no surgeries, a family history of heart trouble and some stomach issues in your brother, and you don't smoke, drink much, or take any medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know? Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Everything sounds good there. Now, I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful. Hmm, not much tenderness, but it does feel a little…full. And I'm not feeling any masses. Now, I'll listen to your abdomen. I'm hearing some normal bowel sounds, but they seem a little…quiet. Alright. Just one more thing. I’m going to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there too. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it could be a few things. It could be something simple like a mild gastritis, or it could be something else. Given your age, and the fact that you're feeling full quickly and have some constipation, I think it's best to do some further testing to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to do some blood work and a stool test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Blood work and a stool test… alright. Whatever it takes. It’s just… I’d like to know what’s going on. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious, eh? But you're the expert, and I trust your judgement. When can we get those done?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you're willing to do the testing. We can get those done right here at the clinic today. The blood work will check for things like inflammation, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The stool test will check for any signs of bleeding or infection. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw the blood, and I'll give you a container for the stool sample. It's fairly straightforward. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Sounds pretty straightforward, as you say. Just a bit…unpleasant, the stool sample, perhaps? But never mind. I’ve faced worse, I suppose. When can I expect to get the results back? And will you explain them to me? I don't understand a lot of the medical jargon, you know. I'm a simple man.
DOCTOR: Yes, the stool sample isn't the most glamorous part, but it's important. It usually takes a few days to get the results back—I’d say around 3-5 business days. When the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment and I’ll go over everything with you in detail. I’ll make sure to explain everything in plain language, no medical jargon, I promise. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating a balanced diet. Are you able to manage that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can manage that. Plenty of fluids and a balanced diet… that’s what my wife tells me anyway! She’ll be pleased to hear me say that. So, 3-5 business days… alright. I’ll keep an eye out for a call. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or any symptoms I should watch out for that would mean I need to come back sooner? Just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Just continue with what we discussed. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room: severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, significant weight loss, or a change in your bowel habits, such as bloody stools. Other than that, just try to rest and stay hydrated. I'll have the lab technician come in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the stool sample. Do you have any further questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate it. Severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, significant weight loss… I’ll keep those in mind. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better just knowing what we’re looking for. I’ll see you in a few days, hopefully with some good news. .
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Obarr. My pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll have the lab technician come in now. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
