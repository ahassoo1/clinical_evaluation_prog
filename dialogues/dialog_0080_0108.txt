DOCTOR: Hi Brad, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, it's… not good. I’ve been, uh, throwing up blood. Not a ton, but enough to scare the bejeezus outta me, you know? It started a couple days ago, kinda just… came on. It’s red, bright red. Like, you see it and you know somethin's wrong. I haven’t been feelin’ great either, weak mostly. I’m Brad Gentz, by the way. Though you probably already know that.
DOCTOR: Right, Brad Gentz, 51 years old. And you've been vomiting blood for the past couple of days. Bright red blood, you said. Okay. And you’re feeling weak as well. Can you tell me a little more about the vomiting?
PATIENT: Look, it ain’t like a fountain, okay? It's mixed in with...well, you know. Food. Whatever I ate. It usually happens in the mornin’, right after I get up. And it’s not every mornin’, thankfully. But when it happens, it’s… concerning. I haven’t changed anything in my diet. Same stuff I always eat – mostly rice and lamb. And I haven’t been drinkin’ or anything, not for years. It just… started. I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s mixed with food, happens in the mornings after getting up, and isn't every morning. And you haven’t changed your diet and haven’t been drinking alcohol. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any abdominal pain with this, or any nausea before the vomiting?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… sometimes. Not sharp, more like a dull ache, lower down. Like, where your stomach is, but lower. And yeah, always nauseous beforehand. Real queasy. It’s kinda like… seasickness, but not as bad. It builds up slowly, then boom. It’s just… unpleasant. And makes me not wanna do much of anything, you know? This whole thing just feels wrong. It's probably somethin' serious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the lower abdomen along with the nausea before vomiting. Seasickness is a good way to describe it. I understand your concern, Brad, and you're right to get this checked out. Now, let’s go over some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – anything darker than usual, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Now that you mention it… been a little darker. Not black, nothin' dramatic, but… definitely not the usual color. A little stickier too, if that makes sense. And no, no blood in it, thankfully. But it’s been… different. I don’t pay that much attention to that stuff, to be honest, but yeah, it's been off. Look, I'm a crematory operator, alright? I deal with… things. I don't need to be worryin’ about the color of my… you know. But I noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker and stickier stools. I appreciate you noticing that, even though it’s not something you typically focus on. That's important information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I've had the usual colds and flus, but nothin’ major. My wife… God rest her soul… she was the one with the problems. High blood pressure, she had. I always stayed healthy. That’s why this is so… weird. I haven’t seen a doctor in years, to be honest. Not since… well, never mind. Look, I'm a pretty simple guy. Eat right, work hard, that's about it. No fancy pills, no nothin'. Just...this. And it's scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, haven't seen a doctor in years, and your wife had high blood pressure. I understand. And it's understandable to be scared when something unexpected like this happens. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery, not even for somethin’ like appendicitis or anything. Always been lucky, I guess. Until now. It's just… I'm worried it's somethin' serious. You know, somethin' that's gonna take a long time to fix. And I don’t have insurance, so… that’s another worry. I don't have a lot of money saved up, not enough for a big medical bill. This whole thing is just… a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And you’re uninsured. I’m noting all of this, Brad. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Give me a good rice pilaf and a strong cup of tea, and I'm right as rain. Never taken a pill in my life, unless you count aspirin for a headache, and that was years ago. I'm a simple man, remember? Natural remedies, that’s what I believe in. Though I gotta admit, nothin' natural is helpin' this. This feels like somethin’ serious, somethin’ that needs real help. Not some herbal tea, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements. Just rice pilaf and tea. Let's move on to family history. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, such as stomach problems, bleeding disorders, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had stomach ulcers. Bad ones. Spent a lot of time in pain. They gave him somethin' for it, I think. Though I don't remember exactly what. And my mother… she died young, from… well, it was a long time ago. I don't recall anything specific about her medical history. Nobody really talked about that stuff back then. Mostly, we just dealt with things as they came. Look, we weren't a fancy family. Just… hard workin’ people. Not a lot of medical records or nothin’. This is probably just a stomach thing, right? Like my father had?
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had stomach ulcers. I’m noting that. One last thing regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I told you, I don't drink. Not for years. Haven’t touched a drop. And I certainly don’t smoke, or do any of that… other stuff. I'm a crematory operator, remember? I deal with enough… unpleasantness as it is. I don’t need to be messin’ with poisons. Straight edge, that’s what I am. Always have been, always will be. It’s probably stress, right? This job… it can get to you. But stress wouldn’t make you throw up blood, would it? I'm startin' to panic a little.
DOCTOR: No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Okay, Brad. I appreciate you being so open with me. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me—the vomiting of bright red blood, the nausea, the dull abdominal pain, the darker stools, and your father’s history of ulcers—this warrants further investigation. While it could be something relatively benign, such as a stomach ulcer, the blood is concerning and needs to be ruled out as something more serious. I'm going to need to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, check for any tenderness, and feel for any masses. Then, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels – that’ll tell us how much blood you’ve lost. We'll also need a stool test to check for any blood or infection. And, depending on those results, we may need to consider an endoscopy to look directly into your stomach and esophagus. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Lookin' down a… a tube? That sounds awful. I don’t like the sound of that at all. But… I guess I don’t have much choice, do I? I mean, I gotta figure out what's wrong. Blood tests and a… a look inside… fine. Do what you gotta do. But just… try to be quick, alright? I'm not good with… procedures. And how much is all this gonna cost? I really don’t have a lot of money, like I said. This is makin' me anxious just thinkin’ about it. Just… tell me straight. What are we lookin’ at, cost-wise? And what exactly are you lookin' for down there? Is it definitely somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand your anxiety and your concern about the cost. We'll get through this. Let’s start with the endoscopy. Yes, it involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end that we insert into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It allows us to directly visualize the lining of those organs and look for any abnormalities, like ulcers, inflammation, or bleeding sources. It's usually well-tolerated, and we can give you some medication to help you relax. Regarding the cost, it's difficult to give you an exact number without knowing the specific tests required and your insurance status. However, a basic endoscopy can range from $1500 to $3000. Blood tests will add another $200-$500, depending on what we need to check. I know that's a lot of money, and I want to assure you that we'll work with you to find options to make it affordable. We have a financial assistance program available, and we can also discuss payment plans. As for what we’re looking for, we need to rule out several possibilities, including: Peptic ulcers: These can cause bleeding, especially if they're not treated. Esophagitis: Inflammation of the esophagus, which can also cause bleeding. Gastritis: Inflammation of the stomach lining. Varices: Enlarged veins in the esophagus, which can bleed. Less common causes: such as tumors or other abnormalities. Let's proceed with the physical exam and the blood tests first. Once we have those results, we'll have a better idea of what's going on and can discuss the next steps in more detail. Okay, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry, alright? I don't like bein’ poked and prodded. And if it's bad news, just… tell me straight. I don't need sugarcoating. I'm a practical man. Just lay it on me. But please… be quick. This whole thing is stressin’ me out somethin’ awful. I'm already feelin’ queasy just thinkin’ about it. And… what if it’s cancer? Is that somethin’ we’re lookin’ for? Just… tell me the truth. I can handle it. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand your anxiety. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I promise to be honest with you every step of the way. Cancer is always a possibility when investigating these kinds of symptoms, but it’s just one of many things we need to rule out. We won’t jump to any conclusions until we have all the facts. Okay, take some deep breaths for me. I'm listening for any unusual sounds – gurgling, popping, or decreased bowel sounds. I’m also palpating your abdomen to check for tenderness or any masses. Alright. I’m detecting some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, which is where you mentioned the pain. Your bowel sounds are a little diminished, but that could be due to the nausea. I don't feel any obvious masses. There’s no guarding or rigidity, which is a good sign. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 140/90 – but that’s likely due to anxiety. Your pulse is 80 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Okay, based on the physical exam, everything appears relatively stable, but the tenderness and diminished bowel sounds warrant further investigation with the blood tests and potentially the endoscopy. Do you have any questions about the exam itself?
PATIENT: No… not really. It wasn't pleasant, but… I guess you had to do it. But the elevated blood pressure… that's not good, is it? I haven't had high blood pressure before. Is that somethin’ the stress is causin’? And… what about the blood tests? How long before we get those results? I don’t wanna be waitin’ around for days, wonderin’ what’s wrong. And what do they even look for in those tests? Just… tell me straight. What are we checkin’ for, exactly? And if it is somethin’ serious… what kind of treatment are we talkin’ about? Surgery? Pills? I gotta know. Just… lay it all out for me. Don't sugarcoat nothin’. I’m a practical man. I can handle the truth. Even if it's bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand your anxiety, and you’re right to ask these questions. Your elevated blood pressure is concerning, but it’s likely a temporary response to the stress and anxiety you’re experiencing. We’ll monitor it closely and discuss strategies to manage it, such as lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. It doesn't necessarily mean you have chronic high blood pressure, but we need to rule it out. The blood tests will provide a lot of information. We’ll be checking: Complete Blood Count : This will tell us your red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and platelet count. It can help us determine if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood and if there’s any sign of infection. Liver Function Tests : This will assess your liver health. Kidney Function Tests: This will assess your kidney health. Electrolytes: This will check your electrolyte balance. Coagulation Tests: This will check how well your blood clots. Hemoglobin A1c: This will help rule out diabetes. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. As for treatment, it depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it’s a peptic ulcer: Treatment typically involves medication to reduce stomach acid and protect the lining of the stomach. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a bleeding ulcer. If it’s esophagitis: Treatment typically involves medication to reduce stomach acid and lifestyle changes to avoid irritants. If it’s cancer: Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy, depending on the type and stage of the cancer. I know that’s a lot of information, and it can be overwhelming. But remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. We’ll get the blood tests done, review the results, and then discuss the best course of action. I will be here with you every step of the way, to answer your questions and provide the best possible care. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I think I got it. It's just… a lot. Cancer… that’s what I’m scared of, I guess. Always been a healthy man. Never smoked, never drank, ate right… It just seems unfair. And the cost… I still haven’t heard anything about that. I’m on a fixed income, and I can’t afford a huge bill. Do you think… is there anything you can do? Maybe a payment plan? Or some kind of assistance program? I don’t wanna end up in debt just tryin’ to get healthy. And… if it is cancer… how long do I have? I know it's a morbid question, but… I gotta plan. I gotta get my affairs in order. I don’t wanna leave a mess for anybody. Just… be honest with me. Even if it's bad news. I can handle it. I think. .
DOCTOR: Brad, I understand your fears and your concerns. It’s completely natural to be scared and anxious in this situation. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to help you, both medically and financially. Let's address your concerns one by one. First, regarding the cost, we do have a financial assistance program available for patients with limited income. I’ll have our billing department contact you to discuss your options and see if you qualify. We also offer payment plans to help you spread out the cost over time. We will work with you to find a solution that fits your budget. Second, regarding the prognosis, it's impossible to say anything definitive without knowing the diagnosis. If it is cancer, the prognosis depends on the type of cancer, the stage of the cancer, and your overall health. We will provide you with all the information you need to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. I understand you need to plan for the future, and I respect that. If you are diagnosed with cancer, we can connect you with a social worker who can help you with practical matters, such as financial planning and end-of-life care. But please, let's not jump to conclusions. We haven't even received the blood test results yet. We're going to take things one step at a time. We’ll get the results, review them together, and then discuss the best course of action. I know this is a lot to process. I want you to know that I’m here for you every step of the way. I will answer your questions, address your concerns, and provide you with the best possible care. I'm going to order those blood tests now. The lab will draw a sample, and we should have the results within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
