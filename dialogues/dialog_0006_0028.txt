DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sadhu, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Gorga. It’s this cough. It just won’t quit. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, maybe a month now? And it feels worse when I lie down. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes, you know? My heart… well, you know about my heart. It just feels… full.
DOCTOR: A month, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Started right after that bit of rain we had. Not a bad rain, mind you, but chilly. I thought maybe a cold, but it just… stayed. And it’s not like a regular cough, Doctor. It’s… wet, if that makes sense? Lots of… stuff coming up. Sorry to be graphic.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s alright. Wet cough… okay. And you said it's worse when you lie down?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely worse lying down. I have to prop myself up with… well, usually three pillows now. Used to be just one was fine. And it wakes me up at night, too. My husband, bless his soul, used to say I sounded like a frog. He’s been gone five years now, though. It’s lonely at night with this cough keeping me up.
DOCTOR: I see… and you mentioned your heart. Do you take any medications for that currently, Mrs. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take this Lisinopril, every morning. And a water pill, Furosemide, to get rid of extra… fluid, the doctor told me. And sometimes, if my legs swell, I take another one, but I don't remember the name right now. It's a small white one. I take everything the doctor tells me to. I’m very good about my pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Furosemide… good. Do you know the dosage of those, by chance?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dosages… now that’s tricky. Let me see… the Lisinopril is… 20 milligrams, I think. Yes, 20. And the Furosemide… 40 milligrams. Yes, 40. I have to write them down, you know, or I forget. I used to be so good with numbers. Ran my husband’s store for years! But things slip… you know how it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Alright, 20mg Lisinopril and 40mg Furosemide. Any allergies to medications, Mrs. Sadhu?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with any pills, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I even used to be able to eat spicy food, but now… well, now I mostly just eat soup. Easier on everything, you know? And I don't want to upset my heart. Is that important, knowing about the spice? I just thought I’d mention it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. It helps me get a full picture. Now, let’s do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, if that's alright. Just to see what's going on. Could you just sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. My heart has been… fluttering a little lately, you know. Not painful, just… noticeable. I hope it’s not anything serious. I just want to feel better. It’s hard to do much when you’re tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright… I’m hearing some congestion in your lungs, which explains the cough. Your heart… it is a little irregular, as you mentioned. A bit of a murmur, and the rhythm is a little fast. I also hear some crackling sounds. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mrs. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The swelling comes and goes. Mostly in the evenings, after I’ve been on my feet a bit. Sometimes it’s just a little puffiness, other times… well, other times I can barely get my shoes on. I usually put my feet up, that helps some. I also drink a lot of water, the doctor told me to. Does the crackling mean it’s bad, Doctor? I get worried easily, you know. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. The crackling could indicate some fluid buildup in the lungs, which is consistent with the swelling in your ankles and your history of heart issues. We need to investigate this further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what's happening. We'll also do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Do you mind if I draw a little blood now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, go ahead. I don’t like needles, but I understand. I just want to feel better. An X-ray… will that hurt? And what about the EKG? I’ve had those before, I think. Little stickers, right? Are those the stickers that make your skin itchy afterwards?
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. And yes, the EKG involves little stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. Some people do find them slightly itchy afterward, but it’s usually mild. The nurse will remove them right away. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, and then we'll discuss the next steps. Let me call the nurse in to draw the blood now. It will be just a small amount, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A small amount… that’s good. I always get so cold when they draw blood. And my veins… they’re not very good, you know. Sometimes it takes them a long time to find one. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything. It helps to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sadhu. Don't worry, we'll take our time. The nurse is very good at finding veins. I'll be right back to discuss everything once we have the results. Just try to relax, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'll try. It's just… everything feels a little overwhelming sometimes. But I appreciate you taking care of me. And thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. It really does make a difference. My husband always said I worry too much.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to worry, Mrs. Sadhu. We'll figure this out together. I'll check in with you as soon as the nurse is finished with the blood draw. Just take a few deep breaths.
