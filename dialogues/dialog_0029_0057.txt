DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… about the cancer. It’s been a little while since I last saw someone about it, and I wanted to get another check-up. I’m a bit worried, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're being proactive about this. "A little while" is vague – could you tell me approximately when you were last seen for this, and by whom?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… back in November, I believe. At Saint Luke's Hospital. Dr. Ramirez was the one who… who told me about it. She was a really nice lady. I don’t remember the exact date, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. November… that's about nine months ago. And Dr. Ramirez confirmed a cancer diagnosis, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She did. It was… in my breast, I think? She did some tests and… and that’s what she told me. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. It happened so fast.
DOCTOR: Okay. And did Dr. Ramirez discuss a specific type of breast cancer with you at the time?
PATIENT: I… I don't recall. She said a lot of things, and I was pretty upset. I think she mentioned something about… cells? And needing treatment. But the specific name… no, I don’t think so. I'm sorry. It’s just… hard to remember all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly understandable. A lot comes at you during those appointments. Do you recall what kind of treatment Dr. Ramirez discussed?
PATIENT: She talked about… chemotherapy, I think. And maybe radiation. Something about shrinking the… the tumor. I remember being really scared of losing my hair. And being very sick. That’s mostly what I remember, to be honest. The side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay. And did you begin any chemotherapy or radiation treatment with Dr. Ramirez?
PATIENT: No, I didn't. My husband… he got sick right after that, and then… well, he passed away in January. I just… I couldn't. I didn't have the strength to go through with it then. I just focused on him.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your husband. That is a tremendous loss, and it’s completely understandable that you wouldn’t have been able to focus on your own health at that time. So, to clarify, you haven’t received any cancer treatment to date?
PATIENT: No, sir. None at all. Just the tests at Saint Luke's with Dr. Ramirez. That’s it. I haven’t been back since. It’s been… a hard year.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes a lot of courage to come back and address this after everything you’ve been through. Before we get to a plan, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure I have everything. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I used to take antibiotics sometimes for sinus infections, but nothing ever bothered me. I don’t really take much medication at all, normally.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. Just… vitamins sometimes. A multi-vitamin, when I remember to buy them. But I haven’t taken one in a few months, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay. And in terms of your past medical history – have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries besides the cancer evaluation?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. But nothing major. No other illnesses that I can recall. I’ve always been pretty healthy, usually. Until… this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removal and a broken arm. No other significant medical history. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had diabetes. And her mother, my grandmother, had heart trouble. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never sick a day in his life. That’s about all I know, really. We weren't very close, so we didn’t talk about medical things much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in your grandmother. And finally, before we get to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? You mean… like, do I drink or smoke? No, sir. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I mostly just… stay home.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, very limited alcohol use. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll start with checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’d like to examine the area where Dr. Ramirez found the… abnormality. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I… I’d just like to get this over with, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 120 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Weight is 112, height is 179… Okay. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to examine your breasts. I'm going to gently palpate both breasts and the surrounding areas, looking for any changes. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… That… that feels a little tender, right here. It’s been like that for a while, I think. Not new. But it feels… different now, maybe. Harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a small, firm lump in the upper outer quadrant of your left breast. It’s approximately one centimeter in size. It does feel somewhat harder than the surrounding tissue. Is it painful to the touch?
PATIENT: Not really painful… more like… uncomfortable. A dull ache sometimes, but it's not constant. It's just… there. And it worries me, naturally. I haven't really… done a self-exam in a while, to be honest. I should probably be better about that.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good you're noticing these changes. I don’t feel any other lumps in either breast, and your lymph nodes under your arm don’t seem swollen, which is a good sign. However, given your history and the change you’ve noted, we need to investigate this further. We're going to need to order some imaging tests and likely a biopsy.
PATIENT: A biopsy? What… what does that mean? Is it… is it bad? I… I don’t want to have surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. A biopsy is a procedure where we take a small sample of the tissue from the lump and send it to a lab to be examined under a microscope. It's the best way to determine exactly what this lump is. It doesn't necessarily mean surgery, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… And what if… what if it is cancer? Like before?
DOCTOR: Okay. If it is cancer, we have many more treatment options available now than there were even nine months ago. We’ll discuss all of those, of course. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to get the results of the biopsy first. We’ll do a mammogram and an ultrasound to get a clearer picture of the lump, and then we'll schedule the biopsy. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A mammogram… I remember Dr. Ramirez doing that. It hurt. And… who would do the biopsy? Will it be painful? I… I don't have anyone here with me. My husband… he always came with me.
DOCTOR: Okay. The mammogram can be uncomfortable, yes, but the technician will do their best to minimize any discomfort. The biopsy will be performed by a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in imaging. They’ll numb the area before taking the sample, so you shouldn’t feel significant pain. We can arrange for a nurse to be with you during the procedure for support. And I understand not having your husband with you. I can schedule the appointment for a time when you feel most comfortable, and we can talk through all your concerns beforehand. Would you like me to provide you with information on support groups in the area as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. A support group… maybe talking to other people… And… when do you think I could have the mammogram and ultrasound? I just… I want to get this done. The worrying is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have my nurse schedule you for a mammogram and ultrasound at the hospital next week. I'm thinking Tuesday morning would work, but let me know if that doesn't suit you. We'll get the results as quickly as possible, usually within a few days, and then schedule the biopsy. I'll write you a referral for the imaging center. In the meantime, try not to worry too much – we're going to get this figured out. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. .
DOCTOR: Okay. You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’ll have my nurse give you the referral and information on the support groups as you leave. If anything comes up before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care.
