DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Dr. Seil. Nice to meet you as well. I’m just here to get some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare sent me a bunch and said I needed a doctor to sign off on 'em. Nothing wrong with me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fabing. That's perfectly alright. We're happy to assist with those forms. To ensure everything is completed accurately, I will need to review them with you and ask a few clarifying questions – just to have a complete record, you understand. It’s standard procedure even when it’s just for form completion. Do you have the forms with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. They're… a lot, aren't they? I tried to read through 'em, but some of the wording was kinda confusing.
DOCTOR: Yes, they can be quite extensive. Medicare forms often are. Don't worry about the confusing wording; that’s why we’re here. Let’s start with this first one, the Health Insurance Claim Form, CMS-1000. I see your date of birth and insurance information are already filled in. Have you had any changes to your insurance coverage recently?
PATIENT: Nope, no changes to my insurance. Still with Medicare, same as always. I've been pretty lucky with it, to be honest. My husband, Earl, retired from the reservation police force, so that’s how we got on it. He's doing good, by the way – just a little slower these days, you know how it is.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about Earl, Ms. Fabing. It’s good that he’s doing well. And Medicare is a valuable resource. Moving on. This next section asks about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not really, no. I had a bit of trouble with my weight after the kids were born, but I’ve been walking a lot and eating better, so that’s under control. Earl and I try to go for a walk almost every day, weather permitting, of course. Montana winters can be brutal. I did have pneumonia when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Fabing. The pneumonia as a child is good to note, even though it was a long time ago. And it’s excellent to hear you're prioritizing your health with walking and a good diet. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Nope, never been in the hospital. Not even for the kids! They both came just fine, thank goodness. Earl was a nervous wreck both times, but everything went smooth. I think a little bit of luck and some strong Blackfeet genes helped with that. No surgeries either. I’ve been pretty fortunate, health-wise.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Fabing. It sounds like you've been very fortunate indeed. Now, just to complete the record, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. I take one every morning with breakfast. Nothing fancy. And sometimes I’ll take some ibuprofen if my arthritis is acting up, especially in the cold. But that’s about it. I try to avoid taking too much stuff if I can. Earl always says, “The less you put in your body, the better.” He's a pretty sensible man.
DOCTOR: That’s a good philosophy, Ms. Fabing. Sensible indeed. And it’s helpful to know you’re only using medication as needed. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, pretty much. Earl's family is pretty strict about what they eat – traditional foods and all – but my side is more… adventurous. Never had a reaction to anything. I think I’d remember that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would, Ms. Fabing. That’s excellent to know. Okay, just one last thing. While we’re completing these forms, would you mind if I quickly check your height and weight and take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that’s fine. No problem at all. I probably should get that checked anyways, been meaning to. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Great. If you’ll just step on the scale for me, and then I'll take your blood pressure. No need to do anything special. Okay, your height is 171 centimeters and your weight is 70 kilograms. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s slightly elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. We can monitor it at your next visit. Now, let’s go through these forms together and make sure everything is accurate. Do you have your glasses?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Okay, let's see... I’m ready when you are. That blood pressure's a little high? Maybe I should walk Earl faster tomorrow!
DOCTOR: That's a great idea, Ms. Fabing! A little extra walking never hurts. Alright, let's start with the first page of this CMS-1000 form. It asks for your personal information. We already confirmed your date of birth and insurance details. Now, it asks about your primary care physician. Do you currently have a regular doctor?
PATIENT: No, not really. I usually just come here when I need something. It’s not that I don’t want a regular doctor, it’s just… hard to find one that takes Medicare and doesn’t have a waiting list a mile long. Plus, Dr. Reynolds retired last year and I haven't found anyone else I really trust yet. I’ve been okay just coming here for checkups and things. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fabing. Many patients find themselves in that situation. We’re happy to provide your care. We can document that you are establishing care with us today. The next section asks about your race and ethnicity. You’ve already indicated Blackfeet Tribe, which is great. It's important for us to have that information for proper healthcare documentation and cultural sensitivity. Do you identify with any other tribal affiliations or ethnicities?
PATIENT: Nope, just Blackfeet. My grandma came straight from the reservation, and my grandpa too. We've been here a long time, passed down traditions and everything. That's why it's important to me that whoever I see knows that part of my life, you know? It matters.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fabing. It does matter, and we appreciate you sharing that with me. We strive to provide culturally sensitive care to all our patients, and understanding your background helps us do that. Now, this next section asks about emergency contact information. Can you please provide the name and phone number of someone we can reach in case of an emergency?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy. That’d be my husband, Earl. He's always there for me. His number is 555-1212. He’s retired now, so he’s usually home. He'll answer it, or it'll go to voicemail if he's out in the garden. He loves his tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Perfect. 555-1212. And his name is Earl Fabing, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Earl Fabing. He's a good man, been married to him for… oh, goodness, almost 40 years now!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Fabing! Congratulations on almost 40 years together. Now, this last section on this page asks about your consent to release medical information. It essentially asks if we have permission to share your medical records with other healthcare providers if needed. Are you comfortable with us sharing your information with other doctors or hospitals if it's necessary for your care?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. If it helps me get better, or helps Earl, then yes. I don't see a problem with it. Just let me know if anyone asks for it, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fabing. We will always inform you before releasing any of your medical information. Alright, we’ve completed this first page of the CMS-1000 form. Do you have any questions about anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: Nope, I think you explained everything pretty well. It’s a lot of paperwork, but I’m glad we got through it. What's on the next page? More questions?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few more sections, but we’ll take it one step at a time. The next page focuses on your insurance information again, just to double-check everything. It asks for your Medicare card number and the effective date of your coverage. Do you have your Medicare card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you go. I keep it with me just in case. You never know when you’ll need it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fabing. Everything matches up. Next, it asks if you have any other insurance coverage, such as a supplemental plan. Do you have any other insurance in addition to Medicare?
PATIENT: Nope, just Medicare. Earl has a little bit through his retirement, but it doesn’t really cover much. We mostly just rely on Medicare for everything. It’s enough, thankfully. I think he has a prescription plan, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no supplemental insurance. Good to know. The next section asks about who is responsible for paying your medical bills. It’s a standard question, but often it's yourself. Is that correct in your case?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Me and Earl pay our own bills. We've always been good about that, thankfully. We don't owe anyone anything. It’s a good feeling, being able to take care of things yourself.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fabing. It’s good to know. Now, this last section on this page is a statement of understanding. It simply states that the information you provided is accurate to the best of your knowledge and that you understand you are responsible for paying your bills. Would you mind signing and dating it at the bottom of the page?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There you go. All done. This is a lot of signing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, Ms. Fabing. But we’re making good progress. Now, we’ve completed the CMS-1000 form. The next form is a bit different. It's a Medical History form, and it asks more detailed questions about your past health issues, medications, allergies, and family history. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s do it. I’m a pretty healthy person, so hopefully, it won’t take too long. But ask away!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I had a little trouble with my weight after the kids, but I lost it. And… I do have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly when it’s cold. Not too bad, but it stiffens up sometimes. Other than that, no, not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. Does that count as a chronic condition? It's more of a nuisance than anything else.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does count, Ms. Fabing. Arthritis is a chronic condition, and it’s good to note that, especially since it affects your hands. We can discuss ways to manage it later, if you’d like. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason other than childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: Nope, never. Not even for the kids, like I said before. Thankfully, both pregnancies went smooth as could be. Earl was a wreck, but I was fine. He always worried too much. I just don’t do hospitals, if I can help it. They smell funny!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Fabing. It’s good you've had such healthy pregnancies. We'll do our best to keep it that way. Now, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Not a fan of knives! I've been lucky so far. Knock on wood. I try to stay healthy and avoid anything like that. It's all about taking care of yourself, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Fabing. Preventative care is key. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing that I know of. I eat everything put in front of me. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've even tried some spicy stuff that Earl’s sister makes, and I didn't even flinch! So, I think I’m pretty safe on that front.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fabing. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, like I said before. I take one every morning with breakfast. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it. I try to avoid taking too much stuff if I can. Oh, and sometimes I take something for heartburn, but only if I eat something really spicy!
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen, and something for heartburn as needed. Now, let's move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years ago. She had a good long life, thankfully. My dad… he’s still around, but he’s getting pretty old. He lives with my sister now, she takes good care of him. He's a tough old bird, though. Strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your mother, Ms. Fabing. It’s good your father is being well cared for. Did either of your parents have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mom, she had a little bit of high blood pressure towards the end, but other than that, she was pretty healthy. My dad, he had a heart attack a few years ago, but he recovered pretty well. He takes medication for it now, and he’s doing okay. He's stubborn, though, doesn't always listen to the doctor. My sister has to keep after him.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and a heart attack in your father. Do you have any siblings?
PATIENT: Yes, I have one sister, like I mentioned. She's a few years younger than me. She's pretty healthy too, thankfully. No major medical problems with her either. She's the practical one in the family, always taking care of everyone. She's a good sister.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, finally, this form asks about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. Earl tried it once when he was younger, but he didn't like it. And we don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. And definitely no drugs! We’re pretty healthy people, remember? We like our walks and fresh air. That’s our kind of fun.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Fabing. It sounds like you have a very healthy lifestyle. Now, we’ve completed the Medical History form. Do you have any questions about anything we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Nope, I think you covered everything pretty well. It was a lot of questions, but I’m glad we got through it. It's good to have everything down on paper, just in case. What's next? Are we done filling out forms?
DOCTOR: Almost, Ms. Fabing! We have one more short form – a brief review of systems. It’s a checklist of common symptoms to help me get a more complete picture of your overall health. It shouldn't take too long. It simply asks if you've experienced any recent changes or problems with different body systems, like your heart, lungs, digestive system, and so on. Do you mind if we go through it together?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. I'm pretty sure everything is good, but I don't mind checking a few boxes. It's always good to be thorough, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Fabing. Let's start with your general health. Have you had any recent unexplained weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Nope, no weight loss or gain. Like I said, I lost a little bit after the kids, but that was years ago. I've been pretty steady ever since. Maybe a pound or two around the holidays, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent weight changes. Have you experienced any recent fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. I haven't felt sick in a long time, thankfully. I usually get a cold every winter, but nothing too bad. I try to stay healthy, so I don't get too many colds.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Have you noticed any fatigue or weakness lately?
PATIENT: Nope, no more than usual. I get tired after a long walk, but that’s just because I’m getting older! Earl gets tired too, we're both getting up there in years. I wouldn't say I’m unusually fatigued or anything. I sleep pretty good at night, so I’m usually pretty rested.
DOCTOR: Okay, no unusual fatigue. Now, let's move on to your heart. Have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. My heart feels good, thankfully. I get a little winded after climbing stairs, but that’s just because I’m getting older and out of shape! Earl had a little bit of chest pain a few years ago, but he’s doing okay now. I wouldn’t say I’ve noticed anything unusual with my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Nope, no swelling. Like I said, I try to stay active, and I don’t eat a lot of salty foods. I think I'd notice if my ankles were swelling up! Everything feels pretty normal down there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no ankle swelling. Let's move on to your lungs. Have you had any cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath, even without exertion?
PATIENT: Nope, no cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath. I might get a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but that’s just because of the dry air. I wouldn't say I've had anything unusual with my lungs. I try to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Now, regarding your digestive system, have you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits, abdominal pain, or nausea?
PATIENT: Nope, everything is pretty regular down there. I eat a lot of fiber, so that helps. I might get a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just if I eat something spicy. I wouldn't say I've had anything unusual with my digestive system. I try to eat a healthy diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or nausea. Finally, have you noticed any recent changes in your skin, such as rashes, moles, or lesions?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible. I get a little bit of sun when I'm walking, but I try to wear sunscreen. I wouldn’t say I’ve noticed anything unusual with my skin. It's getting a little bit wrinkled, but that's just because I'm getting older! Is that everything? Are we done with the forms now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fabing, that is everything! We’ve completed all the forms. Now, I’d like to briefly review your medical history and then perform a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick visual assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. I figured you’d want to do that after all this paperwork. It’s good to be thorough, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Fabing. Thoroughness is key. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is still a little elevated, but nothing alarming at this point. Your pulse is good and regular. Everything looks good. You appear to be in overall good health. Based on your history and the physical exam, everything appears to be normal. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, so I recommend we monitor it regularly. We can discuss lifestyle modifications to help lower it, if you’d like. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Lifestyle modifications... what does that mean? I’m already walking a lot, is there something else I should be doing? Maybe cutting back on salt? I do like my tomatoes, but I can try to eat less of 'em. I just want to stay healthy, you know? For Earl and the grandkids. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fabing. It’s wonderful you prioritize your health. Lifestyle modifications simply mean making some changes to your daily habits to improve your blood pressure and overall well-being. Cutting back on salt is a good start. Tomatoes themselves aren’t necessarily bad, but many processed tomato products contain a lot of sodium. Fresh tomatoes are fine in moderation. Other things you can do include: Maintaining a healthy weight: You're already active, which is great. Eating a heart-healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Regular exercise: Continue your walking routine, and try to incorporate some strength training exercises. Managing stress: Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as yoga or meditation. Limiting alcohol consumption: If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. We can discuss each of these in more detail. Would you like me to provide you with some educational materials on lifestyle modifications?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be great. Educational materials would be helpful. I like to have something to read and refer to. And maybe a list of foods to avoid? Or a recipe for something healthy? I’m a pretty good cook, but I mostly make traditional Blackfeet dishes, which aren’t always the healthiest. Maybe you can help me find some healthy alternatives? I really appreciate your help, Dr. Seil. You seem to know a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I'm happy to help. Here, I have some handouts on healthy eating and lifestyle modifications. They include a list of foods to avoid, recipes for healthy meals, and tips for managing stress. I also have a website with information on traditional Blackfeet dishes and healthier alternatives. These resources should be a good starting point. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your lifestyle plan. Do you have any questions about the materials or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Seil. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll read through these materials and try to make some changes. Maybe I'll try to find some healthier ways to make my traditional dishes. And thank you for being so patient with all my questions. I appreciate it. I think I’ll go home now and see if Earl wants to go for a walk. Maybe we'll walk a little faster this time! Have a good day, Dr. Seil.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It was a pleasure meeting you. And that’s a great idea – a faster walk sounds like a good plan! Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. Have a wonderful day, Ms. Fabing. And enjoy your walk with Earl.
