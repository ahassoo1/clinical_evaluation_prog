DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about my eyes, really. They’ve been bothering me with the light. Everything seems too bright, and it hurts. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's making things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of light sensitivity and discomfort… I understand. Can you tell me a little more about the discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It's not like a sharp pain, more like a really bad strain, you know? Like I’ve been staring at the sun for too long, even when I haven’t. And it makes me squint a lot. It's worse outdoors, definitely. Inside, with the lights dimmed, it’s not so bad. But even a bright phone screen can be a problem sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s more of a strain or discomfort than a sharp pain, worse with bright light, particularly outdoors, and even phone screens can bother you. And it's been going on for a few weeks. Do you notice any blurry vision, halos around lights, or any double vision at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not blurry vision or anything like that. And no halos or double vision either. Just the…brightness and the strain. It's just really annoying, to be honest. Makes it hard to even read sometimes, even with sunglasses. And I worry about going outside, especially now with the sun being so strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in vision besides the sensitivity, thankfully. And it's impacting your ability to read and you're concerned about being outdoors. Have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had a bit of a sniffle maybe a month ago, but it didn’t last long. Nothing major, just a normal little cold. It didn’t feel connected to this, though. And I haven't been travelling anywhere recently, just staying local.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illness or travel. Do you wear glasses or contacts normally?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never have. My eyesight’s always been pretty good, until this started. It's a bit worrying, to be honest, because it feels like something’s definitely changed. It’s not like I’m used to needing glasses or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new symptom for you and you’ve never needed corrective lenses before. And it's concerning you because of that. Let’s do a quick examination of your eyes. I’m going to check your vision, look at the structures of your eyes, and check your pupils. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need to figure out what’s going on. I really appreciate you taking the time to look at it. Hopefully it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your vision. Can you read the smallest line you can on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let me see… um… is that an E? Yes, I can see that. And… that one, too. Oh, this one is blurry… and this one… I think I can make out a few letters on this line, but it's hard. I can definitely see the big ones at the top, but it gets pretty fuzzy after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a starting point. Now, I'm going to shine a light into your eyes and check your pupils and the back of your eye. Just look straight ahead and relax. It won't be painful, just bright for a moment. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. I’m seeing some mild redness in both eyes, but no obvious swelling or discharge. The optic discs look healthy, but there is a slight haziness to the lenses. It’s subtle, but present.
PATIENT: Okay. Haziness, you say? Is that… bad? What could be causing that? I'm a little worried now, to be honest. I haven’t noticed anything different with my vision apart from the brightness. Could it be something to do with the sun? I’ve been trying to wear sunglasses, but…
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, Arbin. The haziness is mild, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things – potentially early development of cataracts, or even just some temporary inflammation. And yes, sun exposure can contribute to these kinds of issues, which is good that you're wearing sunglasses. Given your symptoms and what I'm seeing, I’d like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying inflammation or vitamin deficiencies. And I’d also like you to see an ophthalmologist for a more detailed examination of your eyes. They have specialized equipment that can give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work and a specialist… okay. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. I just want to get this sorted out, really. The constant brightness is quite tiring. Will the blood work tell us much? And do you have any recommendations for an ophthalmologist nearby? I don't want to have to travel too far, if possible.
DOCTOR: The blood work will help us rule out things like inflammation, which can sometimes cause eye discomfort, and check for deficiencies in vitamins like Vitamin D, which can play a role in eye health. It’s just a precautionary measure, but it gives us more information. Let me pull up a list of ophthalmologists in the area. Dr. Anya Sharma is very good, and her office is just a short drive away on Elm Street. She specializes in cataract and glaucoma, but she does comprehensive exams as well. I can print you out her contact information and a referral form. It should be covered by your Medicare, but you might want to confirm with their office. In the meantime, continue wearing sunglasses, even on cloudy days, and avoid staring directly at bright lights if possible. If the brightness becomes unbearable or you experience any changes in vision – blurry vision, double vision, or floaters – please contact me immediately.
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, thank you. Dr. Sharma on Elm Street… I’ll make an appointment first thing tomorrow. And I will definitely keep an eye on things, and contact you if anything changes. Sunglasses and being careful, got it. Thank you, Doctor Roseburrough. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll get the blood work done as soon as possible and schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. That's what I'm here for. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get this figured out. I'll have the lab order and referral form printed for you now. And just to recap, you're experiencing light sensitivity and discomfort, we’ve ruled out any immediate concerns with a quick exam, and we’re sending you to Dr. Sharma for a more detailed evaluation and ordering some blood work. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s absolutely perfect. Light sensitivity, discomfort, detailed evaluation with Dr. Sharma, and blood work. You’ve got it all right. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing what the next steps are. I'll be in touch if anything changes. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. Take care, and I hope you have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you need anything at all.
