DOCTOR: Right. Cleo Rover, 47 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… um, right. The… insurance. Someone said I need to… get checked out for… long-term stuff. For when I… get older, I guess. My wife… she used to handle all this. It's been a bit since… well, since she passed. I don't really know what it all means, to be honest. Just that they sent me here.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it sounds like this is a preventative visit, perhaps requested by your insurance company. It's good you’re getting it checked out, even if it’s a bit confusing. We'll do a general assessment of your health, just to make sure everything is functioning as it should. It's better to catch things early, you know. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly…? Not… really. Not since… well, after my wife got sick, I mostly just… focused on her. I took her to all her appointments, of course. But me? No. I figured I was… okay. I do… some work, you know? Moving things around. Nothing fancy. I think I saw a doctor once, a long time ago, for a bad cold, maybe? But it was years and years ago. I don't remember the name. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's… good to know. So, no significant past medical history that you're aware of. Do you have any current symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Uh… well, my back gets a little sore sometimes. From the work, I guess. Lifting and stuff. And… I get tired easier than I used to. But that could just be… getting older, right? Everyone says that happens. I wouldn’t say it’s bad tired. Just… more tired. And… sometimes my hands feel a little… numb. But not always. It comes and goes. Is that… a symptom? I don’t know what counts as a symptom.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's break that down a bit. The back soreness – where exactly is it?
PATIENT: Uh… lower back, mostly. Right around here. And it's not… sharp pain. It’s more like a… dull ache. After I’ve been lifting boxes all day, it feels… tight. And sometimes it goes up my… side a little. Not bad, just… uncomfortable. It usually gets better if I lie down for a while. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look. If you could just lie down on the examination table for me, that would be great. We'll just do a quick assessment of your back, check your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing to worry about, just a routine check.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Is… is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles. My wife… she didn’t like them either.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I assure you. We’re just going to feel around a bit, check your range of motion. Just relax as much as you can. Alright, can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh… um… not very well, I guess. It’s a little… tight. I haven’t been stretching much lately. Been too busy with… things. It feels a little… pinched when I bend that far. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like something’s pulling. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything seems alright so far. Your reflexes are good, and your strength is normal. It sounds like you may have some muscle strain in your lower back. But to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Just routine stuff – check your kidney function, your blood count, and your vitamin D levels. Low vitamin D can sometimes cause muscle aches. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… That sounds… okay, I guess. I don't really like doctors, or hospitals, or… well, anything medical. But if it helps… yeah. Okay, blood tests. My wife… she always said I should take better care of myself. She was right about most things. Where do I go for those? And how long will it take? I got some work I need to get back to. Not that it’s important, but…
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They’ll just need a small sample of your blood. It shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes, and then the results usually come back within a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, I recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen for the back pain, and try to avoid any heavy lifting if possible. And honestly, try to incorporate some gentle stretching into your daily routine. Your wife sounds like a very wise woman. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… yeah, I think I have some ibuprofen. My wife… she always kept a good stock. Stretching… I’ll try. It's just… hard to remember. And… well, I just feel tired all the time. Not physically tired, but… like something’s missing. I don’t know. Um… no, I don't think I have any questions. Just… thank you. For… everything. I guess. I’ll go get the blood tests. Is there anything else I need to do? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, that's all for now. Just go to the lab, and they'll take care of everything. And if you find the back pain worsening, or if you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a card with our number. And remember, taking care of yourself is important. Even if it's just a little bit at a time. Have a good day, Mr. Rover. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, doctor. You too. …My wife… she would have known what to do. .
