DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… fine. Really, it’s not a big thing. I just… well, my sister said I should come get a little card from you. A “get well” card, she called it. Though I'm not sick, exactly. Just a bit… low, you could say. She thinks a card from a doctor would cheer me up. You know how sisters are. Always fussing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your sister to encourage you to come in, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Sometimes just talking things through with someone can be beneficial. So, you said you're feeling a bit “low.” Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like I'm depressed, mind you. I just… things aren't as good as they used to be. My son, he doesn't call as much. And the neighbors, they've let their garden go completely wild. It's an eyesore, honestly. And my husband, bless his heart, he leaves his socks everywhere. It's just… little things, piling up. Not a proper illness, but… bothersome. Really bothersome. Do you really need me to explain all this to a doctor? It feels a bit silly, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Janeth. It doesn’t feel silly to me. All of those things – changes in your life, things that bother you – they absolutely can affect how you feel, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to discuss them. It sounds like you’ve experienced a few changes and stressors recently. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… around the time the bakery closed, I suppose. That was… February, wasn't it? Yes, February. Such a lovely bakery. They made the best sel roti. And then my son got that new job, which is good, of course, but he’s so busy now. So… probably about six months, give or take. It's not constant, you understand. Some days are better than others. But the socks… the socks are always there. It’s very distracting, you know? A properly tidy house is important for peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And it sounds like these feelings are tied to some life changes, like the bakery closing and your son’s new job. The socks are certainly a detail that stands out! It’s good that you’re aware of what triggers these feelings. Besides feeling “low,” have you noticed any other changes in how you’ve been?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite, it’s not what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, a big meal for the family. Now… well, I mostly just have toast. And I sleep… I sleep a lot more. Used to be, I'd be up early, tending to the garden. Now I just… lie there. And sometimes, I just feel… tired. Not physically tired, but… everything feels heavy. It’s hard to explain. It's not like I'm ill, mind you. Just… lacking my usual pep. And, honestly, I've been a bit forgetful lately. Not major things, but… where did I put my glasses? Oh. See?
DOCTOR: I understand. Changes in appetite, increased sleep, feeling tired and heavy, and some forgetfulness – those are all things we should definitely talk about. It's good you're recognizing these changes. And please, don’t feel like you need to apologize for mentioning them. To help me get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… well, not much, really. I’ve always been a strong woman. Never really needed doctors much. A bit of this, a bit of that, nothing serious. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my knees, they ache sometimes, especially in the winter. My mother, she had arthritis, so it’s probably that. And I had my vaccinations, of course, when they started all that fuss. But nothing major. Honestly, I think I'm just getting old. Is that what you think, Doctor? Is it just old age? It’s probably just old age. A bit of wear and tear, that’s all.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And it’s not uncommon to experience changes as we get older. However, even if something is related to aging, it’s important to make sure there isn’t something else going on that needs attention. To clarify, when you say your knees ache, is that a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, dear. Worse in the cold weather, like I said. And after I’ve been gardening, of course. But it's not debilitating, mind you. I can still manage. I just need to take it easy sometimes. A bit of liniment, that's all. And a warm bath. My husband is very good at running baths, bless him. Though he does leave his socks everywhere afterwards. It’s just… a constant battle, really. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think the socks are trying to take over the house. It’s silly, isn’t it? Worrying about socks. But they’re a symbol, you see? A symbol of… I don’t know… chaos!
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Janeth. Sometimes little things can be very symbolic, and it's helpful to understand how they make you feel. Now, besides your knees, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Well, my back sometimes aches, if I bend over for too long. But that's just old age, I suppose. And my eyes, they get tired. I need stronger glasses, I think. But everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days. It’s hard to explain. Like a film over everything. And my memory, it’s not what it used to be. I went to the shops yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went for! It was… embarrassing. I just stood there, staring at the shelves. It's not like major things, you understand. Just… little slips. But they’re adding up, aren't they? It's probably just getting old. It’s what happens, doesn’t it? Everything slows down. And the socks… they multiply.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're experiencing several changes, and it's understandable that you're concerned. The fuzzy vision, occasional forgetfulness, and changes in energy levels… those are all things we should explore further. And I hear you about the socks! To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… well, my mother, she had arthritis, like I said. And she was a bit… forgetful in her later years, I think. But she never went to doctors much, either. Stubborn woman, she was. My father, he was strong, healthy. Worked in the fields all his life. No major illnesses, as far as I know. My sister, she's fine, thank you very much. Always been a healthy woman. A bit bossy, perhaps, but healthy. And my husband… well, he’s got a bit of a cough sometimes, especially in the winter. But nothing serious, you understand. He’s a strong man. He just leaves his socks everywhere. It's a mystery, really. A complete mystery. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think those socks have a life of their own.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Janeth. That gives me a good sense of your family history. Now, let's talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I used to love gardening, as I mentioned. Spent hours out there, tending to my flowers. But it's harder now, with my knees and my back. And my eyes… it's hard to see the weeds, you see? I used to do a bit of knitting, too. Made sweaters for my grandchildren. But I haven’t knitted anything in months. I enjoy cooking, when I have the energy. Used to make big meals for the family. But now… mostly just toast. And I like to watch television, of course. Keep up with the news. But it's mostly sad news these days, isn’t it? And I used to enjoy a good gossip with my sister, but she's busy now, with her… well, with her things. It's all a bit quiet, really. Very quiet. And the socks… they just sit there, multiplying.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've experienced some changes in your activities and energy levels. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite isn’t what it used to be, like I said. I mostly just have toast, or a bit of soup. And I think I’ve lost a bit of weight. Not much, you understand. But my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven't weighed myself properly in months, though. Too busy worrying about the socks, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think they’re shrinking my clothes! It’s silly, isn’t it? Worrying about socks and shrinking clothes. But everything feels a bit… off, these days. A bit out of sorts. It's probably just getting old. Everything slows down, doesn't it? Even the appetite. And the weight… it just seems to disappear.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to be concerned about these changes, Janeth. And while some changes are a natural part of aging, it’s important to investigate further to rule out any underlying causes. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I don’t like taking pills. My mother never took pills, either. Stubborn woman, she was. I used to take a bit of vitamin D in the winter, when there’s not much sunshine. But I haven’t taken any in months. And I don't believe in all those fancy supplements. Waste of money, if you ask me. I prefer a good cup of tea, that's what I believe in. And a bit of toast. And maybe a bit of gossip with my sister, when she has the time. But mostly just tea. And toast. And of course, I have to contend with the socks. They don’t require any medication, thankfully. Just a bit of tidying up. But they’re a constant battle, really. A constant, unending battle.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Janeth. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I've always been lucky, in that regard. Never had any bad reactions to anything. My mother was the same. Stubborn woman, she was. Always said a strong constitution was the best medicine. I do get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring, with the pollen, but that's just a bit of hay fever. Nothing serious, you understand. I don't think I'm allergic to socks, thankfully. That would be a disaster. Honestly, Doctor, if I was allergic to socks, I don't know what I'd do. It's a terrifying thought. A truly terrifying thought. But no, no allergies, as far as I know. Just a bit of a sniffle sometimes, and a constant battle with the socks.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Alright, Janeth. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. I suppose it can't hurt. Though I don't expect you'll find anything. Just a bit of old age, I expect. And a bit of tiredness. And the socks, of course. They're not part of the physical exam, are they? Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think those socks should have their own examination. A full, thorough examination. But no, just me, I suppose. Alright, go ahead. Though I do hope you don't find anything too alarming. I'm not good with alarming things. Just a bit of old age, I expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Janeth. We'll take things slowly. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then check your blood pressure. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and do a basic neurological assessment. And no, the socks won’t be part of the exam, though I appreciate your concern for them. If you could please have a seat here, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Sounds… thorough. I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a bit of toast waiting for me at home, you see. And my husband will be wondering where I am. And of course, the socks will be multiplying. It’s a constant worry, really. A constant, unending worry. But alright, let’s get it over with. Just be gentle, dear. I’m not as young as I used to be. And please, don't mention the socks to anyone. It’s a bit embarrassing, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. We’ll take everything at your pace, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. And your secret is safe with me – I won’t mention the socks to a soul. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Deep breaths… I used to be very good at deep breathing. Yoga, you see. But that was years ago. Now… it’s a bit harder. Is that alright? Was that deep enough? I do hope my lungs haven't shrunk. Not like my clothes, I hope. And not like the patience of my sister. And please, don’t think too much about the socks while you’re listening to my lungs. It’s a distraction, you see. A terrible distraction. But alright, go ahead. I’m breathing. Deeply, I hope.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I do hear some wheezing in your lungs. It’s not immediately concerning, but it’s something we should investigate further. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight around your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, irregular, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? My mother always had a very strong heart. Stubborn woman, she was. But I suppose everyone gets old eventually. And the wheezing… well, I do get a bit of a sniffle sometimes, as I mentioned. Allergies, I suppose. Not like the allergies I have to tidying up after my husband. But alright, go ahead. Blood pressure, you say? Will it hurt? I do hope it doesn't interfere with the socks. They’re very sensitive, you see. A terrible distraction, as always. But alright, do your worst. Gently, dear. Gently.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t usually hurt, Janeth. It just feels a bit of pressure. And I assure you, it won’t affect the socks. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Again, not immediately alarming, but something we need to keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Can I feel your wrist?
PATIENT: Oh, elevated, you say? My mother always had very low blood pressure. Stubborn woman, she was. But I suppose things change eventually. And everything gets old eventually. And everything shrinks eventually… not like the socks, I hope. Is this alright? Will it hurt? I do hope it doesn't interfere with my tea. I'm rather looking forward to a cup of tea. And the toast. And… well, you know. But alright, do your worst. Gently, dear. Gently. And please, don’t mention the socks to anyone. It’s a bit embarrassing, you see. A terrible, terrible distraction.
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt at all, Janeth. Just a quick check. Your pulse is a little fast, around 88 beats per minute. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it should be quick. Do you have any pain in your ears or throat?
PATIENT: Oh, fast, you say? My mother always had a very slow, steady pulse. Stubborn woman, she was. But I suppose things change eventually. Everything shrinks eventually… not like my socks, I hope. No pain, no. Not really. Just a bit of… stuffiness in my nose, sometimes. Allergies, I suppose. And a bit of a tickle in my throat, sometimes. But nothing serious, no. Nothing alarming, I hope. Just a bit of… well, you know. But alright, go ahead. But please, be gentle. Very gentle. And please, don't mention the socks. It's a bit embarrassing, you see. A terrible, terrible distraction. And please, hurry. I'm rather looking forward to my tea. And the toast. And… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. I’ll be as gentle as possible. This won't take long. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little red, but nothing major. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs again, just to double-check. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh, red, you say? My mother always had a very healthy throat. Stubborn woman, she was. But I suppose things change eventually. Everything shrinks eventually… not like my socks, I hope. It's just a bit of… stuffiness, I suppose. Allergies, I think. And a bit of… well, you know. Please, hurry. I'm rather looking forward to my tea. And the toast. And… and please, don't mention the socks. It's a bit embarrassing, you see. A terrible, terrible distraction. And please, be gentle. Very, very gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be. And… and I'm starting to feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth, just take a deep breath. You’re feeling a bit faint, you say?
PATIENT: Oh… Yes… faint. Very faint. And… and dizzy. And… and everything is spinning. And… and I think… I think I’m going to… And… and please, don't mention the socks. It’s a bit embarrassing, you see. A terrible, terrible distraction. I… I think I need my tea. And the toast. And… and my husband. Please… please, hurry.
DOCTOR: Janeth, stay with me. You’re safe. Nurse is on their way. Just focus on your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths. In… and out… Can you tell me your name for me?
PATIENT: …Janeth… Janeth Micucci… But… but please… don't mention… the socks… it's… it’s a terrible… distraction… I… I just want… my tea… and the toast… and my husband… please… hurry… Everything… spinning…
DOCTOR: Janeth, you're doing a good job. Just try to breathe deeply with me. In… and out… We're going to get you feeling better. We're taking care of you. Don't worry about anything else right now. Just focus on your breathing. We’ll get you some tea and toast soon. And your husband will be here shortly. "Let’s get an EKG, and check her blood sugar. And call for a portable chest x-ray."
PATIENT: …socks… spinning… tea… husband… please… hurry… too… tight… everything… fading… please… don’t… mention… the… socks…
DOCTOR: "BP is still elevated, pulse is rapid and irregular. She’s losing consciousness. Prepare to administer a small dose of lorazepam to help calm her down. We need to rule out a cardiac event or a stroke. And get a hold of her emergency contact. This is escalating quickly." "And please, let's keep the room calm. This is going to be a difficult situation."
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: "Let’s prepare for transport to the ICU. This patient needs a higher level of care."
