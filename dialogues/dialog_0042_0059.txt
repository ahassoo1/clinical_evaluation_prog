DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um... well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been... not speaking as clearly as I usually do, I suppose. My speech has been a little slurred, and it’s been worrying me. I don’t quite remember when it started, though. It just... happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Slurred speech is definitely something we want to investigate. It's helpful that you've noticed a change. You said you don’t recall when it started exactly… can you think of anything that was happening around the time you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. I really don’t have a good recollection, Doctor. Everything feels a bit… hazy, if that makes sense? I’ve been quite busy with work, managing the construction sites, and things have just been moving so fast. Perhaps it was around the time of the Thompson project? Or maybe before… I honestly can’t be sure. It’s terribly frustrating. I do remember feeling a little more tired than usual, but that’s not unusual for my job, is it?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Adyn. Your job does sound demanding. It's not unusual to feel tired with a role like that. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When you say “slurred speech”, can you describe what that feels like to you?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s… difficult to describe. It’s not like I can’t form the words, Doctor, it’s more like they don’t come out quite right. Like… everything is a little mumbled, I suppose? My husband keeps asking me to repeat myself, which is new. And sometimes I stumble over the words a little, even when I’m thinking clearly. It’s not constant, though. It seems to come and go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent slurred speech is important information. And the fact that your husband has noticed a change is also very helpful. Now, aside from the speech, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t really looked for any other symptoms, Doctor. I suppose I’ve been focusing on the speech. But now that you mention it… I have been feeling a little bit clumsy lately. I dropped a toolbox the other day, which isn’t like me. And I bumped into a doorframe yesterday. Just small things, really. Nothing major. Also, my vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just from staring at plans all day. It’s hard to say, honestly. I haven't been paying close attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness and blurry vision are definitely things we need to consider. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s another area where my memory isn’t the best, I’m afraid. I do have Medicare, so I must have something on file, but I couldn’t tell you exactly what. I've been generally healthy, as far as I know. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized or anything like that. My husband manages most of the paperwork, so he would know more details. I believe I had a standard check-up last year, but I don't recall any specific findings. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Adyn. It's okay that you don’t recall specifics. Medicare will allow me to access your records. Now, what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I haven't had any surgeries. Not that I remember, anyway. I’m quite certain about that. I've never been under anesthesia or anything like that. I'm not one for medical procedures, if I can avoid them. I prefer to stay healthy and active, and thankfully, I've been able to do so for the most part. I do get a bit anxious around hospitals and doctors, which is probably why I didn't mention this sooner.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one, Doctor. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don't recall her having any major health problems. She was generally healthy, like me. My father is still alive, but we’re not very close, and I haven’t spoken to him in years. I don’t know anything about his medical history, I’m afraid. There's some history of high blood pressure on my grandmother’s side, I believe, but that's all I can recall. It’s a bit of a blank, honestly. I wish I had more information for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Adyn. We can work with what you do remember. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never have, never will. I find I have quite enough on my plate managing the construction sites without needing any of those things. I do enjoy a good cup of tea in the evenings, though! And my husband and I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s about it. We generally live a pretty healthy lifestyle. We try to eat well, get enough sleep, and stay active whenever we can. It's not always easy with my job, but we do our best.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to medications in the past. I can take most things without any problems. I've never had any food allergies either. I’m generally very cautious about what I put into my body, so I’m pretty sure I would have noticed if I had any allergies. Hopefully that covers everything. I know I haven’t been very helpful with the details, but I do appreciate you trying to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, thank you for that information. It's helpful to have a full picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, balance, coordination, and vision. It will help me assess what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgment. Please do whatever you think is best to figure out what’s causing this. I’m a bit worried, of course, but I’m glad I came in. Please just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your eyes. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, and don’t blink?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I'm following it… up and down… left and right… is that okay, Doctor? Everything seems a little blurry, but I’m trying my best to keep my eyes on it. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. A little blurry is what I expected based on what you mentioned. Now, let's check your pupils. I’m going to shine a light in your eyes. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Your pupils are reacting, but they are a little sluggish. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, let’s check your eye movements. I want you to follow my finger again, but this time, I want you to look in all directions – up, down, left, right, and diagonally. I notice a slight nystagmus in your left eye when you look to the extreme left. It's subtle, but present. Okay, let’s move on to checking your balance and coordination. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s a bit… wobbly, Doctor. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. I'm trying to stay steady… Please let me know if you see anything concerning. I’m a little worried about falling. I hope I don’t… Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, easy now. It’s alright. A little unsteadiness is not uncommon, especially when you’re feeling unwell. I’m here to support you. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple tests. First, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend both of your arms out in front of you. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this, Doctor? It feels a little strange being off balance with my eyes closed. I'm trying to keep my arms straight, but they’re trembling a little. Just let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. There's a slight drift to the left arm, and a little resistance when I try to move your right arm down. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap your knee with this small hammer. It might cause a slight jerk, but it shouldn't hurt. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a bit brisk, especially on the left side. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on what I’m hearing and seeing, there are a few things that we need to investigate further. The slurred speech, the blurry vision, the clumsiness, the nystagmus, the brisk reflexes, and the slight weakness… it's concerning. I think we should order some imaging of your brain – a CT scan, to start – and I’d also like to order an MRI. And I want you to get a blood test to check for any underlying inflammation or infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A CT scan and an MRI… That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something… really bad? I haven’t done any of those tests before. And blood tests… I always get a bit faint around needles. What are we looking for exactly? Is it something… neurological? I’m starting to get quite worried. And what would the imaging show? Please tell me everything you can. I trust your judgment, but I’d appreciate as much information as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, it’s understandable that you’re worried. It’s always frightening when we start looking at more in-depth testing. Let me explain. The symptoms you’re describing – the slurred speech, vision changes, coordination problems – can be caused by a variety of things. While it could be something relatively benign, we need to rule out anything serious, like a stroke, a tumor, or multiple sclerosis. The CT scan will give us a quick overview of your brain, looking for any obvious abnormalities, like bleeding or swelling. The MRI will give us a more detailed picture, allowing us to see the brain tissue itself and identify any small lesions or inflammation. The blood tests will help us look for any signs of infection, inflammation, or autoimmune disorders that could be affecting your nervous system. I want to be clear: I’m not saying you have any of these conditions. We're simply gathering information to make an accurate diagnosis. It's far more likely it’s something treatable. The fact that you're relatively young and otherwise healthy is encouraging. But because of the combination of symptoms, it's important to be thorough. We'll schedule these tests as soon as possible. I'll give you a referral for the imaging center. You will receive instructions about how to prepare for each test. As for the blood test, we can have it done here in the clinic, and the nurse will be very gentle. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity and if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as sudden severe headache, weakness on one side of your body, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot to take in, Doctor. A stroke… a tumor… those are very frightening possibilities. And multiple sclerosis… I’ve heard about that. It sounds… debilitating. Avoiding strenuous activity… I suppose that’s manageable. I haven’t been doing much work lately, anyway, because of the speech issues. But the thought of going to the emergency room… that’s terrifying. Yes, I do have a few questions, if you don't mind. How long will it take to get the results of the tests? And what happens if they do find something? What are the treatment options for those conditions? And… is it possible it could be something else entirely? Something less serious? I just… I’m really scared, Doctor. I don’t want anything to be seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared, and you’re right to ask those questions. Let’s address them one by one. The results of the CT scan should be available within a few hours. The MRI will take a little longer, usually 24-48 hours, as the radiologist needs more time to analyze the images. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. As for what happens if we do find something… it depends on the diagnosis, of course. If it’s a stroke, treatment focuses on minimizing brain damage and preventing another stroke. If it’s a tumor, treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management with medications to slow the progression of the disease. But again, I want to emphasize that these are just possibilities. There are many other less serious conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as a migraine, a viral infection, or even a vitamin deficiency. We need to rule out the more serious things first, but that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily what’s going on. I want you to remember that we have a lot of tools at our disposal to diagnose and treat these conditions. And even if it’s something serious, there are often things we can do to improve your quality of life. In the meantime, try to stay positive and focus on taking care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, eat healthy foods, and avoid stress. And please, don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns. We’re in this together. Do you want me to write you a referral for the imaging center now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. A referral would be very helpful. And… thank you. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient with me. I know I’ve been very anxious, and I haven’t been very helpful with the details. Just… if you don’t mind, could you also write down the emergency room instructions, just in case? I’m afraid I might forget. And… what symptoms should I specifically watch out for? I just want to be prepared. I’m really grateful for your help, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Adyn. It’s my job to help you, and I’m happy to provide you with any information you need. Here you are. The referral is for the imaging center on Oak Street. They should be able to schedule you for a CT scan and an MRI as soon as possible. The emergency room instructions outline the symptoms you should watch out for, including sudden severe headache, weakness or numbness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, loss of vision, and difficulty breathing. I also want you to trust your instincts. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention, even if it’s not on this list. I’m also going to write down my direct line here, in case you need to reach me after hours. And I’ve included a link to a reputable website with information about neurological conditions. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and your help. You’ve been very kind and patient with me, and I really appreciate it. I’m still very anxious, of course, but I feel a little bit better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on. I suppose I should schedule the imaging tests now. And I’ll try to stay positive and take care of myself, as you suggested. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. Please, take your time. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. We’ll get through this together. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
