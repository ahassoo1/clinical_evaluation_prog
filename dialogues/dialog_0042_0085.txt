DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… fine, I suppose. It’s this patch on my skin. It’s rather bothersome, honestly. I noticed it a few weeks ago and it just… hasn’t gone away. I’m not usually one to bother with these things, but it’s quite noticeable, and my husband insisted.
DOCTOR: I see. A skin patch that’s been present for a few weeks and is concerning enough that your husband encouraged you to come in. That’s perfectly reasonable to get checked out. Could you describe the patch for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… discolored. Not a nice color, certainly. It's not bright red or anything, more of a… muddy brown, I suppose. And it’s flat. Not raised or bumpy, thankfully. It's about the size of a nickel, maybe a bit smaller. On my left forearm, just below the elbow. I do spend some time in the garden, but I always wear gloves, usually. Though, perhaps not always. It just… looks odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, muddy brown, flat, about the size of a nickel on your left forearm. You garden, and usually wear gloves. That gives me a starting point. Has it changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it hasn’t gotten bigger, I don’t believe. Though, it might be a little darker now. Very subtle, but I think so. And… it doesn’t itch, which I find odd. Everything always itches. Honestly, I thought it would be inflamed by now, but no. It’s just… there. It's quite perplexing. I've tried some lotions, just regular ones, but they didn't do anything, naturally.
DOCTOR: No itching, hasn’t significantly grown, possibly slightly darker, and lotions haven’t helped. That’s helpful to know. You mentioned you garden; do you use any specific fertilizers or pesticides when you’re out there?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My husband handles most of that, really. He’s very particular about his roses. I believe he uses… some sort of granular fertilizer, a blue bag, I think? And a spray for the aphids, definitely a spray. It smells rather potent, even with the mask he wears. I really try to stay out of the garden when he's spraying, it makes my sinuses act up. Honestly, I couldn't tell you the names of any of those products. He’s very… meticulous.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blue granular fertilizer and an aphid spray, used by your husband. You avoid the garden when he sprays due to sinus irritation. That's good information. Would you mind if I take a closer look at the patch?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Please do. It's rather unsightly, and I’d like to know what it is, if you can determine that is. Though, I doubt it’s anything serious. I have rather robust skin, generally. Though, one never knows, does one?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. It’s about 8 millimeters in diameter, fairly well-defined borders, and a brownish discoloration. The texture is smooth, no scaling or crusting. It doesn’t appear inflamed, as you noted. I'm going to document these findings. Have you noticed any other unusual spots or changes on your skin anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Just this one bothersome patch. I do get the occasional mole, but nothing new lately. I have my husband check regularly, he's quite diligent about that as well. He always says I need to be careful. Honestly, I think he worries too much. But better safe than sorry, I suppose. It’s just… it doesn't feel like anything. That’s what's so odd about it.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear there are no other unusual spots, and your husband is thorough with skin checks. It's reassuring you have someone looking out for you. The fact that it doesn't have any symptoms like itching or pain is noteworthy. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I don’t have much of one, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy. I had chickenpox as a child, naturally, and a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago, but that’s about it. No chronic conditions, no major surgeries, no allergies to speak of. I don't take any medications regularly. Just a multivitamin, occasionally. And I had all my vaccinations, as required. My husband is a bit of a hypochondriac, so he keeps very good records. He's quite organized, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. No significant medical history, no allergies, no medications… It sounds like you’re generally very healthy, which is wonderful. Do you have any family history of skin cancer or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My mother had some basal cell carcinoma removed from her nose years ago, I believe. Nothing serious, she had it taken care of quickly. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And a heart condition later in life. Nothing directly related to the skin, as far as I know. My maternal grandmother had… arthritis, terribly debilitating. But again, nothing about skin issues. It's not something we really discussed much in my family, to be honest. More practical matters occupied our time.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of basal cell carcinoma in your mother, high blood pressure and a heart condition in your father, and arthritis in your maternal grandmother. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Absolutely not. I find it a rather disgusting habit. My husband used to smoke, years ago, but he gave it up when we met. He says it was the best decision he ever made. We both prioritize our health, to the best of our ability. We eat a fairly balanced diet – lots of fruits and vegetables from our garden, when in season, of course – and we try to stay active. Not excessively, but we enjoy walking and gardening. A bit of light housework, naturally. We're not particularly adventurous, you see.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. No smoking, healthy diet, and regular activity. It sounds like you're taking very good care of yourself. Finally, do you spend a lot of time outdoors, and if so, do you use sun protection?
PATIENT: Well, yes, I do enjoy being in the garden, as we've discussed. Though, I try to avoid the midday sun, naturally. I usually wear a hat and long sleeves when I'm out there. And I do put on sunscreen… sometimes. My husband reminds me, mostly. He’s quite insistent about it. He says I need to be diligent. Honestly, I'm not terribly disciplined about it, unless he's around. I suppose I should be more careful. It’s just… I don’t like the feeling of it. It makes my hands sticky, and I can't seem to get it off properly. A bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some time outdoors, you wear a hat and long sleeves, and use sunscreen sometimes with reminders from your husband. Alright, Ms. Bartock. I've reviewed your chart and everything seems consistent with what you've told me. Based on what you’ve described, and the appearance of the patch, it's difficult to say definitively what it is without further investigation. It could be a benign lesion, or something that requires closer attention. I'd like to perform a simple skin biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. It's a quick procedure where we take a small sample of the patch and send it to the lab for analysis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A biopsy, you say? Oh dear. Well… I suppose if it’s necessary. I’m not terribly fond of procedures, naturally, but I understand the need for a proper diagnosis. Is it… painful? And will it leave a scar? My husband will be terribly concerned about a scar. He’s very particular about appearances, you see. Will it take long? I have a luncheon planned next week... I simply must know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock. It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about a biopsy. The procedure itself is quite quick – it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We’ll numb the area with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn't feel any significant pain, just a slight pinch initially. You might feel some pressure, but nothing more than a mild discomfort. As for scarring, it's difficult to say definitively. We do our best to minimize scarring, and in most cases, the scar is very small and fades over time. We can discuss options to help minimize the appearance of any potential scar afterwards. As for your luncheon next week, you should be able to attend without issue. The area will be covered with a bandage for a few days, but it shouldn't interfere with your activities. The lab results typically take about a week to come back. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, well that’s… somewhat reassuring. A week to get the results is fine. A bandage for a few days is acceptable, as long as it's not terribly noticeable. My husband would be quite upset if it was. A slight pinch, you say? Not a stab, or a cut? And truly minimal scarring? He does insist on me looking my best. Yes, please do explain the procedure in more detail. What exactly does it involve? And what will I need to do afterwards? Will I need to avoid the sun? He’s quite strict about sun exposure, naturally. I simply must be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The biopsy itself involves using a small, sterile instrument – a punch biopsy tool, specifically – to remove a small, circular sample of the skin. It's about the size of a pencil eraser, maybe a little smaller. After numbing the area with a local anesthetic – a medication injected just under the skin – we'll use the tool to quickly and cleanly remove the sample. It’s a very targeted procedure, and we only take what’s needed for the lab analysis. There will be a small amount of bleeding, which we'll stop with pressure. Then we'll apply a sterile bandage to protect the area. Afterwards, you’ll need to keep the area clean and dry for the first 24-48 hours. We’ll provide you with detailed instructions on wound care. You can apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment if desired, to help prevent infection. You will need to avoid direct sun exposure to the area for at least a week, or until it has fully healed. Your husband is right to be strict about sun protection, as it can affect the healing process and potentially lead to discoloration. We’ll recommend a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher for ongoing protection. We’ll also advise you to avoid picking or scratching the area, as that can lead to scarring. Do you have any questions about any of those instructions?
PATIENT: No, that… sounds manageable. Keep it clean, avoid the sun, no picking… my husband will be pleased. He’s rather meticulous about these things. And what exactly are we looking for in the lab? What kind of possibilities are we considering? I’d prefer to be prepared, if you don’t mind. Though, I trust your judgment, naturally. But he does like to know all the details… and he tends to worry. Is it something serious? Or is it likely just a harmless… growth?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Bartock. The lab analysis, called a histopathology exam, will allow us to examine the skin cells under a microscope to determine the exact nature of the patch. We’re considering a few possibilities. It could be a benign growth, such as a seborrheic keratosis or a mole, which are very common and generally harmless. However, it's also important to rule out other possibilities, such as basal cell carcinoma or melanoma, which are types of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type and is usually slow-growing and easily treatable. Melanoma is less common, but can be more aggressive, so early detection is key. The biopsy is the best way to determine the exact diagnosis and guide the appropriate treatment plan, if necessary. It's important to remember that we're not assuming anything at this point. We're simply taking a precautionary step to ensure your health. Based on the appearance of the patch, and the fact that it's not causing any symptoms, it’s more likely to be a benign growth. However, we can’t know for sure until we have the lab results. Would you like me to explain the potential treatment options for each possibility?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Melanoma… that sounds rather frightening. But you said it’s unlikely. And basal cell carcinoma is treatable, you said. Yes, please do explain the treatment options. Just so I can be prepared. My husband would want to know. He reads all sorts of things online, you see, and he tends to catastrophize. Knowing the options might help him… and me… feel a little calmer. It's just… a bit unsettling, to be honest. Though, I do appreciate you being thorough.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Bartock. It's perfectly natural to feel unsettled when hearing about potential skin cancer diagnoses. I'm happy to explain the treatment options, and hopefully that will provide some reassurance. If the biopsy reveals a benign growth, no treatment is usually necessary. We would simply monitor it periodically to ensure it doesn’t change. If it turns out to be basal cell carcinoma, the most common treatment is surgical excision – removing the growth along with a small margin of surrounding healthy skin. This is a relatively simple procedure with a high success rate. Other options include Mohs surgery, which is a more precise technique that removes the growth layer by layer, and topical medications that can destroy the cancer cells. If the biopsy reveals melanoma, the treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer. Early-stage melanomas can usually be treated with surgical excision. More advanced melanomas may require additional treatments, such as immunotherapy, which boosts the body’s immune system to fight the cancer cells, or targeted therapy, which targets specific proteins in the cancer cells. It’s important to remember that these are just potential scenarios, and we won’t know the exact diagnosis until we have the lab results. And if treatment is necessary, we’ll discuss all the options with you in detail and help you make the best decision for your health. Do you have any questions about any of these treatment options?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Excision, Mohs surgery, immunotherapy… it sounds… rather involved. But you said early detection is key. And you're thorough, which is reassuring. I suppose… let’s just get the biopsy done. I’d like to get this over with, to be honest. And hopefully, it’s nothing serious. Can we proceed? And… how long do we have to wait for the results? A week, you said? Will you call me personally with the results, or will a nurse call? My husband prefers a direct line of communication, you see. He’s very particular.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I understand your desire to get this over with. We can proceed with the biopsy right away. It will only take a few minutes. Yes, you're right, the lab typically takes about a week to return the results. And I will personally call you with the results – I'm happy to accommodate your husband's preference for a direct line of communication. I'll make a note in your chart to ensure I call you directly, and we can discuss the findings in detail. I'll have the nurse prepare the room, and then we can get started. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m ready. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. And… gentle. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. This has been… unsettling, to say the least. But I feel… a bit calmer now, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I'll do my best to make the procedure as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your anxiety, and I'll keep you informed every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly to prepare the area and explain the procedure in more detail. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns. .
