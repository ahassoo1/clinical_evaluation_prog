DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. It’s just…a thing my husband made me come in for. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, the nurse mentioned that. High blood pressure. I understand you’re busy, and I’ll try to be as quick as possible. But it is good you’re getting it checked. Even if you feel fine, it’s important. Can you tell me a little more about when you found out about it?
PATIENT: Found out? Honestly, not that long ago. He got one of those machines for home, you know? One of those blood pressure cuffs. He just…started taking it all the time. Then he started getting upset about the numbers. It was a whole thing. I don’t even remember what the numbers were. He just said it was too high.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your husband has been monitoring your blood pressure at home, and he noticed some elevated readings recently. Do you happen to know roughly when he started noticing these higher numbers?
PATIENT: Ugh, probably…last month? Maybe June? Honestly, I don’t keep track of that stuff. It was after that heatwave, I think. Everything was so hot. He was just…obsessed with it after that. He’s always been a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Alright, so sometime around June, after the heatwave. And he’s been concerned since then. Do you feel any different lately?
PATIENT: Different? No. I feel…normal. Tired, maybe. But that’s just life, right? I work. I have a house. I don’t have time to be feeling things. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Not too much longer, Ms. Dudney. Just trying to get a good picture of things. When you say tired, is that a new thing, or have you generally felt that way?
PATIENT: It’s…worse lately. I used to be able to just push through. Now, I come home and just…sit. My husband keeps saying it's because of my blood pressure, but honestly, I think it's just work. It's a demanding job. A lot of driving. A lot of…everything. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Do you have any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. Sometimes, if I haven’t had enough water. But that’s just dehydration, right? I drink coffee. It happens. Are we going to have to take my temperature or something? I really don’t like thermometers.
DOCTOR: No, no temperature. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your pulse, things like that. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? No. It’s…fine. I wear glasses, but I’ve worn them for years. They haven’t gotten any worse. Honestly, this is all a bit much over nothing. I feel perfectly healthy. My husband is just…overreacting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just do a quick check, and then we can discuss everything. Can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid. And I had the flu once, like everyone else. I’m generally healthy. I eat okay. I don’t smoke. My husband makes me take vitamins. He’s always trying to fix something. Is this it? Can we be done soon?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history. Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. My grandmother had…something with her heart, I think. But she lived to be eighty, so it couldn’t have been that bad. My mom’s fine. My dad…he’s got diabetes, but he doesn’t take care of himself. It’s a whole thing. Honestly, I don’t really keep up with all of that. It's depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I have a meeting this afternoon. I really need to get going. Can we just…write a prescription for something and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand you’re busy and frustrated. But it's important to understand why we’re doing this. High blood pressure often doesn’t have symptoms, which is why it's important to check it. Before we think about any prescriptions, I need to do a quick exam, just to get a better picture of your overall health. It will only take a few minutes. Can we at least do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. But don’t expect me to sit here all day. I have things to do. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here and relax, I'll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is… elevated. 150/90. Heart sounds are normal, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Pulse is 88. Let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…do whatever you need to do. This is uncomfortable. Are you sure this machine isn’t broken? My husband’s machine is always accurate. This is probably a mistake. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Alright. I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG, just to rule out any underlying issues. It's standard procedure with elevated blood pressure. We can also discuss lifestyle changes, and if needed, medication. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Honestly, this is ridiculous. My husband is going to be so smug. Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. But I'm not promising I'll do everything you say. Lifestyle changes? I already told you, I work a demanding job. What exactly do you expect me to do, quit? Do I have to do this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration. It’s not about doing everything I say. It’s about getting the information we need to make sure you’re healthy. The blood work and EKG will help us understand why your blood pressure is elevated. Then we can discuss realistic options for managing it. It might be stress, it might be something else. We can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Ugh. Fine. I guess. But don't expect me to rearrange my whole schedule. Just…get it done quickly. And I want the results as soon as possible. I don't have time for this to drag on. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my day. Is there anything else? Because if not, I'd like to leave.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled the blood work and EKG for tomorrow morning. The lab will send the results directly to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels as much as possible, and staying hydrated. I'm also going to give you a handout with some information about managing high blood pressure. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…get me out of here. Honestly, this is the worst medical experience I've ever had. I have a meeting. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hopefully, the tests will give us some answers. .
