DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my family. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test, with spit, to find out? I want to know about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Ancestry testing… while commercially available, Mr. Scobie, it’s not typically a service offered within the scope of a standard family medicine practice. It’s more of a genealogical pursuit, not a medical one. However, I understand your interest. Are you experiencing any specific health concerns that prompted this inquiry, or is this purely out of curiosity?
PATIENT: Hmm… curiosity, I think. My mother, she tell stories, about islands… far away. But she gone now, and I forget a lot. I want to know for sure. No sickness, Doctor. Just… want to know where I come from. Is the test… expensive?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your desire to connect with your heritage, Mr. Scobie, it's important to understand that these tests provide estimates based on current data, and aren’t entirely conclusive. As for cost, they vary considerably depending on the company. I believe some start around a couple hundred dollars, but can easily exceed that for more detailed reports. Before we discuss pursuing this further, let's briefly review your medical history. It's standard practice to understand your overall health before considering elective tests. Have you been seeing another physician regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Just the nurse at the clinic sometimes, when I need a check-up. I mostly stay home, make things with wood. No big problems, you know? Medicare pays for that, the nurse. I don’t go to doctor often. Just this… this family thing. Is it okay if we talk about the test first?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Scobie. However, I must reiterate that this isn't a medically indicated test. I'm happy to discuss it with you, but I won’t be directly ordering it or providing interpretation of the results. These tests typically require a saliva sample, sent to a private laboratory. They analyze your DNA for markers associated with various populations. The reports they generate can give you a percentage breakdown of your ethnic origins. Do you understand that this is based on comparison to existing databases and isn't a definitive historical record?
PATIENT: Database… like a big book? With names? I understand… a little bit. So it tells you… maybe… where my people might be from? Not for sure? Is it… hard to do the spit thing? I'm not good with complicated stuff. My hands… they shake a little. And what if they can’t find anything? Will I be… sad?
DOCTOR: It's not a "book" with names, Mr. Scobie. Think of it as a collection of genetic information from many people around the world. The test compares your genetic markers to that collection to estimate your ancestral origins. The saliva sample is quite simple. It usually involves spitting into a small tube – no needles or blood involved. The kit will provide clear instructions. As for finding “nothing,” it’s unlikely you’ll find absolutely nothing, but the level of detail may vary. If your ancestry is primarily from a region with limited representation in their database, the results might be less specific. It is possible to feel disappointed, but it's important to remember that your identity isn't defined by a test result. Before proceeding further, let’s examine you briefly. A basic physical assessment is always prudent, regardless of the reason for your visit. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess. A few minutes is okay. I don't like needles, though. You promise no needles? And the spit thing… can I get the kit here? Or do I have to go somewhere? I don't drive anymore. My son, he usually does everything, but he's busy with work. I don’t want to bother him too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no needles, Mr. Scobie. I assure you. A simple examination – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, perhaps a look in your ears. As for the kit, unfortunately, we don't stock them here. You would need to order one online, directly from a company like AncestryDNA or 23andMe. It would be delivered to your home. I can provide you with a list of reputable companies if you'd like. Your son may be able to assist with the online order, and the kit will come with detailed instructions. Now, if you’d be comfortable, please have a seat on the examination table and we’ll begin.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… alright. A list of companies… yes, please. My son, he's good with computers. He can order it. I hope it doesn’t take too long. My old bones get tired easily. And… what if the spit thing doesn't work? Do I have to spit again?
DOCTOR: The kits generally include clear instructions to ensure a sufficient sample. If the initial sample is insufficient, they usually provide a prepaid return label and instructions to resubmit. It's uncommon, but possible. Now, please sit here, and I’ll begin with your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to latex, or any history of sensitivity to adhesives?
PATIENT: No latex, Doctor. Never had a problem with that. And… no sticky stuff bothers me. Just… sometimes my skin gets dry. But it's okay. I put lotion on. Is this where babies are born? My mother told me stories about babies… and doctors with bright lights. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: This is an examination room, Mr. Scobie. Deliveries do take place in this clinic, yes, but not frequently. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. We can monitor that over time. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Your breathing is a little… wheezy. Do you have a history of asthma or chronic bronchitis?
PATIENT: Wheezy? I don't think so. I used to smoke a long time ago… when I was young. But I stopped. Maybe that’s it? It’s just… sometimes I cough a little, especially when the weather is cold. My mother always made me drink tea with honey. That helped. But she's gone now… I mostly just make things with wood. It keeps me busy. And… it smells nice.
DOCTOR: Smoking history is relevant, Mr. Scobie. Even after cessation, the effects can linger. The wheezing could be indicative of chronic bronchitis, but we'd need further investigation to confirm that. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. This will just take a moment. Your ear canals appear clear, but there's some cerumen buildup. Nothing of immediate concern. Alright, Mr. Scobie. That concludes the basic physical assessment. Given your smoking history and the wheezing, I recommend scheduling a pulmonary function test to evaluate your lung capacity. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Pulmonary… what? Is that… another spit thing? I don't like spit things. And I don't want more tests. I just want to know about my family. The ancestors… not my lungs. Can't we just talk about the test? The DNA thing? Please, Doctor. I just want to know where I come from.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, I'm a physician. My primary concern is your health. Ignoring potential respiratory issues to pursue a genealogical hobby is… imprudent. However, I understand your strong desire to learn about your ancestry. To be clear, I will not order the pulmonary function test at this time, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. As for the DNA test, here is a list of reputable companies: AncestryDNA, 23andMe, and MyHeritage DNA. I suggest you review their websites and compare their services. Once you receive the results, you may schedule an appointment to discuss them, but please understand that I cannot provide medical interpretation of the data. We can, however, discuss any incidental findings that might warrant further investigation. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's… that's good. I’ll talk to my son about the websites. He’s good with that stuff. And… maybe we’ll think about the lungs later. No… I think that's all. Thank you for listening, Doctor. Even if you don’t like spit things. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Scobie. Please schedule a follow-up appointment at your convenience. And do consider the pulmonary function test. It’s for your own well-being. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling. Have a good day. .
