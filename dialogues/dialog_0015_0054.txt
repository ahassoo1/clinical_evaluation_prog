DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Cough, yeah. Been coughing... a long time now. And tired. Really tired. Feels like... always got a cold, you know? Sinus... hurts sometimes too. I dunno, just not feeling good.
DOCTOR: Alright. A cough and fatigue, with some sinus discomfort. "A long time now" – could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... specific? Oh boy. Uh... maybe... six months? Or more? Everything kinda... blurs together, you know? I work a lot. Tire shop. Lots of dust, maybe that's it? I keep taking... some medicine from the shop, but doesn't really help much. It just... stops for a bit, then comes back. Worse, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Six months or longer... and it's interfering with work. You mentioned medicine from the shop – do you know what kind of medicine that is?
PATIENT: No, no idea. Little red pills. My boss, he gives it to us. Says it helps with the dust. He buys it in bulk, I think. I just... take what he gives me. Don't ask too many questions, you know? I just want to work. It's not... a good job to be sick.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, taking medication without knowing what it is or what it’s for isn’t ideal, Mr. Tati. It could be interacting with other things, or masking a more serious problem. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever... hmm. Sometimes. Not all the time. Like... warm. But I usually just think it's from working so hard. Chills... not really. Night sweats… maybe? I sleep pretty hot, always have. Hard to tell, you know? I just wake up sweaty sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Intermittent fever and waking up sweaty. And the cough… is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Yeah, I bring stuff up. Yuck. Yellow stuff. Sometimes green. Sorry. It's... gross. Especially in the morning. Lots of it. That's why I keep coughing, I think. Gotta get it out.
DOCTOR: Yellow and green sputum… that suggests a possible infection. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain when you cough or breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... sometimes, yeah. When I run up the stairs at home, definitely. Chest pain… not really pain, but kinda… tight? Like someone’s squeezing my chest a little bit when I cough hard. Not all the time though. Just when I really get a bad cough. Right here.
DOCTOR: Okay. We need to listen to your lungs, Mr. Tati. Please sit up straight and take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay... in... out... in... out... Feels weird. Is everything okay? Sounds... crackly, maybe? I dunno.
DOCTOR: I do hear some crackling in your lungs, Mr. Tati. And some wheezing. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated as well. Given your history, the cough duration, the sputum color, and what I'm hearing now… it could be bronchitis, or even pneumonia. We need to get a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh boy. Allergies... uh... not that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. I get… dizzy sometimes, but I think that’s just from being tired. And my back hurts from work. That's it. No… nothing else. Never been to the doctor much. I just… work.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Dizziness and back pain. Alright, Mr. Tati. I'm going to order a chest X-ray right away. We'll need to rule out pneumonia. I also want to check your oxygen saturation level. Just sit still for a moment. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My wife… she doesn’t like it. And I don’t have the money for it anyway. What’s that number mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Your oxygen saturation is 92%. That's a little low. Normal is 95% or higher. It's not critically low, but it explains some of your symptoms and why I want that X-ray. I’m going to send you to radiology now. They'll take the picture. After that, come back here and we'll discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: 92… low? Radiology… is that far? And then… come back here? What if the picture is… bad? I don’t understand, Doctor. Is something really wrong? Is it something from the tire shop? The dust?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand you're anxious. The X-ray will tell us what's going on in your lungs. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is bad. It’s a precaution. Yes, the dust from the tire shop could be contributing to this. But we need to rule out other things first. The radiology department is just down the hall, second door on the left. The technician will explain everything. After the X-ray, return here and we will review the results and discuss a plan. Do you have any questions about getting to radiology?
PATIENT: Down the hall… second door on the left. Okay. I think… I think I can find it. Will it… hurt? The picture? I’m not good with… with things like this.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won't hurt, Mr. Tati. It's a very quick and painless procedure. They'll just ask you to stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. Just try to relax. I'll be here when you get back. Please go to radiology now. Second door on the left.
PATIENT: Okay... okay. Second door on the left. Thank you, Doctor. .
