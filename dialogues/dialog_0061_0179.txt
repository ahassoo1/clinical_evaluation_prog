DOCTOR: Vinaka vakalevu, Sherrell. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. I am here because… well, it is hard to explain. The words… they do not come so easily anymore. It is very frustrating, you understand? I forget what I want to say, mid-sentence sometimes. It’s been… a while now, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. It's completely normal to feel frustrated when your memory isn't cooperating. We'll figure this out together. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. So, when you say it's been a while, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… That is difficult. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It started slowly, I believe. Just little things, forgetting names of… objects. Now… it is more often. It is difficult to say precisely, Doctor. My wife… she would have remembered better. But… she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your wife, Sherrell. That must be very difficult. It’s understandable that it's hard to pinpoint when things started, especially with everything you’ve been through. Okay, so about six months. And you’ve noticed it’s progressed from forgetting names of objects to forgetting things more often?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. Not just names. Sometimes… I look at someone’s face, and I know I know them, but the name… it is gone. Or I will be speaking, and the word… it just… disappears. Like a bubble. It is… unsettling. And it makes it very hard to… to do my work, you understand? Compensation, benefits… it requires… precision.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Sherrell. That sounds very concerning, and it’s good you’re recognizing it’s impacting your work. It's definitely something we need to investigate. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit more about how often these memory lapses happen?
PATIENT: How often… That is… a difficult question. Some days, it is only once or twice. Small things. But other days… it feels like every other sentence. I must… pause often to find the right word. It is… embarrassing, to be honest. I did not used to be this way. I used to… be very quick with my words. Now… it feels like I am searching for something lost. Perhaps… three or four times an hour on a bad day? It varies. Very much varies.
DOCTOR: Okay, so varying frequency, but up to three or four times an hour on a bad day. That's helpful to know. And you said it's affecting your work - can you tell me a bit more about what kind of work you do, and how it’s being impacted specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist. It means… I help companies understand how much to pay people, what benefits they should offer, and… the requirements of different jobs. It requires… a lot of detailed reports. A lot of paperwork. And… communicating with people. Explaining complicated rules. Now… I struggle to write the reports quickly. I misplace files. And… sometimes, I simply cannot explain things clearly. I forget the correct terminology. It is… frustrating for everyone involved. I worry about making mistakes.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a demanding job, Sherrell, and I can see how these memory issues would be particularly problematic. It’s good you’re recognizing that and coming to me. To get a broader picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality recently?
PATIENT: Changes in mood… That is… a good question. I suppose… I am a little more… withdrawn than usual. I do not see my friends as often. I find myself… cancelling plans. It is not… intentional. I just… lack the energy, sometimes. And… I worry about… forgetting things during social events. It is embarrassing. I do not want to… burden people. So… yes, perhaps a little more withdrawn. And… I get frustrated easily. More easily than before. But… I try to keep it to myself. I do not want to… be a bother.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Sherrell. It’s understandable to feel that way. Withdrawing socially and increased irritability can sometimes be associated with memory changes. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had… a heart condition, many years ago. I had a… a stent put in. Perhaps… ten years ago? It is… under control now. I see a cardiologist regularly. And… I have type two diabetes. It is… also under control with medication. But… other than that… nothing significant, to my knowledge. I have always been… a healthy man, despite these things. Until… recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a heart condition with a stent placement ten years ago, and type two diabetes, both currently managed. That's good to know. And you see a cardiologist regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every six months. They run tests, check my levels… Everything is… stable, they say. I take medication as prescribed. I am very diligent about my health. That is why… this memory issue is so concerning. It is… unexpected. I do not feel ill, otherwise. Just… forgetful. It is… frustrating, you understand? To feel so… unlike myself.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Sherrell. It’s very frustrating when something unexpected happens, especially when you’ve been diligent about your health. Now, let’s talk about medications. Could you tell me what medications you’re currently taking, and the dosages if you know them?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… For my heart, I take… Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… Aspirin, 81 milligrams, also once a day. For my diabetes… Metformin, 500 milligrams, twice a day. And… Glipizide, 5 milligrams, also twice a day. I think… that is all. I have a list here, from my doctor. I keep it with me, just in case. I try to… be very careful with my medications. It is… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg once a day, Aspirin 81mg once a day, Metformin 500mg twice a day, and Glipizide 5mg twice a day. Thank you for having that list handy, that’s very helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your history. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I have… sensitive skin, sometimes. But… no true allergies. I can eat anything, take most medications… It has always been… that way. I do not… avoid anything specifically, due to allergies. It is… a blessing, I suppose. But… it does not explain this. This memory issue is… something else entirely.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. Now, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any instances of memory loss or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: Yes… Doctor. My mother… she had dementia. Towards the end of her life. It was… very difficult. She forgot… everything. Her children, her husband… It was… heartbreaking. My wife… she worried about the same thing, towards the end. She said… it runs in families. But… I always thought… I would be spared. I have always been… careful. Healthy. This… it is worrying. It is… very worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. A family history of dementia certainly adds to the reason we need to investigate this thoroughly. It’s good you shared that information. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your general health and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to… understand what is happening. I want to… find out what is causing this. I am… ready for the exam. Whatever you need, just let me know. I am… in your hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Next, I'll test your coordination. Your coordination appears good. Finally, I’m going to do a very quick cognitive assessment. I’ll ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It's nothing to worry about, just helps me get a baseline. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. It is… August… the second, isn’t it? Yes. August 2nd… 2025. I believe. Is that correct? I try to… keep track. It is… important. But sometimes… the dates… they blur together.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, it is August 2nd, 2025. Okay, good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city… Hmm. This is… a rural area, isn’t it? I… I do not recall the name of the city. I drove here from… well, I drove quite a distance. I do not… often travel to cities. It’s… a small town, I think. I’m sorry… I should know this. I feel… foolish.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell, don’t worry about it. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of things, especially when you're not familiar with an area. We’ll figure this out together. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and then I’ll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. I will… try my best. Please… say the words. I will… listen carefully. I want to… cooperate. I want to… find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me, just to make sure I’m clear?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that correct? I… think so. Those were the words? I will… try to remember them. It is… difficult, already. They are… simple words. But… my mind feels… clouded.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Good. Now, let's move on to something else. I’m going to ask you a few questions about your daily activities. Do you have any difficulties with things like cooking, cleaning, or managing your finances?
PATIENT: Difficulties… Yes, Doctor. It is… becoming harder. I used to enjoy cooking, but… I forget ingredients now. I burn things. Cleaning… I used to be very meticulous, but… it piles up. And finances… I used to manage everything myself, but… I have started relying on… someone to help me. It is… embarrassing. I feel… like I am losing control. It is… worrying. It is very worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Thank you for being so open with me. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick assessment I’ve done, it does seem like there’s a decline in your cognitive function, specifically your memory and daily activities. Given your family history of dementia, and the progression of your symptoms, I think it's important to run some further tests to get a more accurate diagnosis. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes, and I’d also recommend a brain scan, like an MRI, to get a closer look at your brain structure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I suppose so. If that is what is necessary. Blood work… and a scan… Whatever you think is best. I… I just want to know what is happening. I want to… understand. If that is the only way… then yes. Please… do whatever you need to do. I… I trust your judgment. It is… frightening, but… I need to know. I need answers.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. I understand this is frightening, and I want to assure you I’ll be with you every step of the way. I’ll get the orders for the blood work and the MRI scheduled. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a medication called Donepezil. It’s a cholinesterase inhibitor, often used in the early stages of dementia to help improve memory and cognitive function. It may not stop the progression of the disease, but it can help manage your symptoms. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not right now. Just… whatever you think is best. I… I trust your judgment. Donepezil… I will… take it as prescribed. If it can help… then yes. I… I just want to feel… better. I want to… remember. I want to… understand. If this medication can help… then yes. Just… whatever you think is best. I… I feel… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'll also give you some information about local support groups for people with memory loss and their families. It can be helpful to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. I’ll write out instructions for the Donepezil, and give you the lab order and information on scheduling the MRI. I want you to call my office if you have any questions or concerns at all. I’m also scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to discuss the results of the tests and see how you’re responding to the medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds alright. Four weeks… I will… be here. Thank you. Thank you for… everything. For listening. For… trying to help. I… I appreciate it. I feel… lost. But… I will… try. I will… take the medication. I will… go to the appointments. I will… try to remember. Thank you. Just… thank you. .
