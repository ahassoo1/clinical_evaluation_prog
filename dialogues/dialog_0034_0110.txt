DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Please, call me Nicoletta. Well, to put it plainly, I feel…stuck. Like an old engine that needs a little help getting going again. I’m hoping you can help me get a “reset,” a little jumpstart to feeling better. I’m 87 years young, and things just aren’t moving as smoothly as they used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicoletta. "Stuck" is a good way to put it. It's very common to experience changes as we get older, and it's good you're addressing it now. Can you tell me a little more about what "not moving smoothly" means for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? It’s not one big thing, you see. It’s…everything feels a bit slower. Getting up in the morning is harder, even with my usual routine. I used to walk every day, down to the market and back, but now…well, now I mostly sit. And I feel tired, just…tired all the time. My memory isn’t what it used to be, either, though I wouldn’t say it's bad. Just…not as sharp. I used to be a teacher, you know, kindergarten and elementary school. Had to keep track of so much! It’s just…a little harder now, remembering names, things like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Nicoletta. That gives me a good starting point. So, we're talking about increased fatigue, some difficulty with mobility – particularly with your daily walks – and some changes in your memory. You mentioned it's not bad, but noticeable. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit more detail. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been…gradual. I’d say maybe the last six months or so. It started with the tiredness, I think. Just feeling more worn out after things. Then the walking… I used to just go. Now, I find myself making excuses. “Oh, it’s too hot,” or “Oh, my knee is a little sore.” Things like that. And the memory… I’d say about the same time, maybe a little after. I used to be so good at remembering birthdays, but now… I have to write everything down. It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Nicoletta. These things are very common as we age, and it’s good you’re being proactive about it. Six months is a reasonable timeframe for these changes. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, must have been…oh, goodness, in my 60s, I think. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, that’s why I mentioned them being sore. It’s mostly manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, honestly. I try to stay healthy, eat my vegetables, but…well, like I said, I just feel a bit stuck. No major illnesses, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nicoletta. And it’s wonderful you’ve been prioritizing your health with a good diet. “Lucky” is good, but being proactive is even better! Have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing else. I did break my wrist when I was a child, climbing a mango tree, but that healed up just fine. It’s been many, many years! No other operations, no. Just the gallbladder.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tricky one. My parents…they both lived long lives, thankfully. My mother passed away in her early 90s, I think, and my father around the same age. But they didn’t really talk about illnesses much. I know my mother had some trouble with her joints in her later years, like me, but that’s about all I remember. My siblings… my brother passed away a few years ago, heart trouble, and my sister, she's still living, but she's not in good health. She has some memory problems, worse than mine, I think. That’s about all I know, really. We weren’t a family that kept track of medical history.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. That gives me a general idea. So, some potential family history of heart issues and memory problems. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain reliever for my knees, when I need it. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing else, no. I used to take something for my cholesterol, years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. Said my numbers were looking good. I don't take any vitamins or anything like that. I try to get everything I need from my food.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed and a history of cholesterol medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve never had any allergies. I can eat anything, take most medicines without any trouble. I consider myself very fortunate in that regard, too. My sister, though, she’s allergic to…well, goodness, I can’t remember what now. But I’ve never had to worry about allergies myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nicoletta. No known allergies. Okay, to get a better sense of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your arms relaxed at your sides?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, though slightly faint. Breathing is a bit labored, but clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes there, perhaps a little diminished. Now, could you please close your eyes and point to your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Is that correct, Doctor? I sometimes have trouble with my coordination.
DOCTOR: That's a little to the left, yes. Not significantly, but we'll note it. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up slowly, if you're able, and walk a few steps for me. I’ll be right here to steady you if you need it.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just a few steps. It feels a little unsteady, but I'm managing.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Please stop there. That’s perfectly fine. It seems you have a slightly wider gait than usual and a bit of unsteadiness, but nothing overly concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some age-related changes, likely including some mild cognitive impairment and reduced mobility. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we'll want to monitor. To get a clearer picture of your cognitive function, I'd like to perform a brief cognitive assessment, a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine what’s going on, I’m happy to answer whatever questions you have. I understand that my memory isn’t what it used to be, so don’t be surprised if I stumble a bit.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nicoletta. It's not a test, just a way for me to get a better understanding. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Today is… August… the second? Yes, August 2nd. Is that correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Very good. Now, what year is it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see… Is it… 2024? No… I believe it’s 2025. Yes, 2025.
DOCTOR: Yes, 2025 is correct. Now, can you repeat these three words for me, and I’ll ask you to recall them later?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. What are the words?
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny. Please remember those. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. Do you know where you are right now?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny… Yes, I do. I’m at Doctor Seil’s clinic. It's a very nice clinic, quite rural, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Now, do you know why you are here today?
PATIENT: Hmm… I’m here… because I feel a bit… stuck, I suppose. I told you, I want a little “reset,” a jumpstart to my health. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, and I wanted to see if Doctor Seil could help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That’s right. And finally, can you tell me your full name?
PATIENT: Certainly. My name is Nicoletta McNabb. M-C-N-A-B-B.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. That was very helpful. Based on everything so far, it appears you may be experiencing some mild cognitive impairment, likely related to age. Your mobility is also reduced, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. To rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a urine analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine what’s going on, I’m happy to have the tests done. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be expecting you. You can schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay as active as possible, even if it’s just gentle walking. Also, try to maintain a healthy diet and stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Two weeks for the follow-up sounds good. I’ll go down to the lab now and get the tests done. Thank you again, Doctor Seil.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment. And remember, staying active and hydrated is key. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Have a good day.
