DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um… hi. It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Alzoubi. I just… moved here. And I guess I need to, like… get set up with a doctor? My husband said I should. He worries a lot. I don’t really… remember much about having a doctor before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Getting established with a primary care physician is a great idea, especially when you're new to an area. And it's good your husband encourages you to take care of your health. So, just to confirm, you’re Emileigh Bonck, and you’re 21 years old, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Emileigh Bonck. Twenty-one… I think. It feels like a long time ago since anyone asked me that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. We can take things at your own pace. Since you're establishing care with me, I'd like to get a good overview of your health history. Let’s start with this: Are you currently having any health concerns or problems that brought you in today, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I feel okay, I guess. Nothing… hurting or anything. I get tired sometimes, but… I always have. Is that something to worry about? I don't know. My husband says I should mention everything, even if I think it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of your husband. It's always best to err on the side of caution. Okay, "tired sometimes" is good to know. Could you tell me a little more about that tiredness?
PATIENT: Just… tired. Like, I can be busy all day, and then just… need to sit down. It’s not like… sick tired. Just… regular tired, I guess? I don't know how to explain it. It happens a lot. And… sometimes I forget things. Not big things, but… where I put my keys, or what I was going to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you experience fatigue even with a full day of activity, and you’ve noticed some forgetfulness. Has this fatigue or forgetfulness been getting worse lately, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Um… I think it’s been… the same? Maybe a little worse. It’s hard to say. Things feel… fuzzy. Like, I can’t remember what I did yesterday, but I don’t think it's new. Does that make sense? I just… don’t have good memories, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, fuzzy memories and consistent fatigue and forgetfulness. Alright. To get a better picture, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I didn’t go to the doctor much when I was younger. My husband says… he thinks I might have had the chickenpox when I was a kid, but I really don’t remember that either.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, I don't think. Definitely not that I remember. I... I would remember something like that, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would likely remember a surgery. Okay, good. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… that’s hard. I didn’t… I didn’t grow up with my family. I was… fostered, a lot. So I don’t really know their medical history. I know my… birth mother had something, but I don't know what. My husband asked, but nobody knew when we got married.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's understandable. It's perfectly alright if you don’t have that information. Let's move on to something else then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not anything. I don't really like taking pills. My husband gives me a multivitamin sometimes, but… I forget to take it half the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always jokes that I have an iron stomach. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. If you think it’s necessary. What will you do?
DOCTOR: Okay, just some basic things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. If you could please sit up on the table, that would be great. I'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt at all. It just involves putting a cuff around your arm and inflating it briefly. Alright. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is 110 over 70. That's within the normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels… weird. Is everything okay? My husband worries a lot, you know. He always says I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: Everything is okay so far. Just opening your mouth for me, please. Throat looks clear, no obvious signs of infection. Now I'm going to check your ears. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes appear normal. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… sensitive. It always feels weird when someone touches my tummy. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay. Just try to relax as much as you can. I noticed some tenderness in your lower abdomen. It's not anything alarming, but it’s something we need to consider. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue, forgetfulness, and some tenderness in your lower abdomen. Given your history of not having regular medical care, I want to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues, such as vitamin deficiencies, anemia, or thyroid problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best. Blood work… will it hurt? My husband will be glad I’m getting this checked out. He always says I need to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: It’ll just be a small sample of blood taken from your arm. There might be a tiny pinch, but it's very quick. We'll also do a urine test just to rule out any infection. I’m also going to recommend a pelvic exam. It’s important to assess your reproductive health, especially given the tenderness you described. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Um… a pelvic exam? I… I don’t know. Is it necessary? It sounds… scary. I haven’t… I don’t really know anything about that.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a pelvic exam, especially if you haven’t had one before. It’s important for a thorough evaluation, and it will help us rule out any potential issues. I will explain everything very carefully, and you can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. It’s a very quick and gentle procedure. We can also postpone it if you'd prefer, but I do recommend it for a comprehensive assessment. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Um… okay. If you think it’s really necessary… then I guess so. But… please explain everything, okay? And I want to be able to stop if I feel… weird. My husband will be glad I’m getting everything checked out, but he won't want me to be scared.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's perfectly alright. We'll take it very slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. You are in control, and you can absolutely stop at any time. I will have a nurse come in and explain the blood work and urine test first, and then we can discuss the pelvic exam in more detail. In the meantime, I'm going to write up some orders for the lab tests and make a note of your concerns. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or ask me before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Dr. Alzoubi. You’ve been very… nice. I hope the tests don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, I’ll get the nurse in to assist you. In the meantime, try to relax. We’ll get everything sorted out. It’s good you came in today.
PATIENT: .
