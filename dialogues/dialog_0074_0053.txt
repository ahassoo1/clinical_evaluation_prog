DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. I see here you’re with Medicare, and we’re glad to have you as a patient. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble going to the bathroom. It just… takes effort, you know? It's not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with urination can be quite bothersome. “Takes effort” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about that effort?
PATIENT: Well, I have to push, sometimes quite hard. And it doesn’t always come out all at once, if you understand what I mean. It starts and stops. And even after I do go, I feel like I haven’t emptied everything. It’s… frustrating, honestly. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month or so now. I thought it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it’s been about a month, with the sensation of incomplete emptying, intermittency – starting and stopping – and needing to strain. Has there been any change in the force of the stream when you are able to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Hmm… yes, I think so. It’s not as strong as it used to be. It’s… weaker. Like trying to water the garden with a hose that has a kink in it. Not a powerful spray, you know? It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… not as much oomph as before. And sometimes it feels like… like little drops dribble out afterward. Even after I think I’m done.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have decreased force of stream, intermittency, straining, and post-void dribbling. Has there been any blood in your urine at all, even a tiny bit?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Not that I've noticed. I always check, you know, just to be sure. Everything looks normal color-wise. And no pain, not in my back or my stomach, not during urination either, just the effort of getting it to start. It’s not a sharp pain, just… discomfort. A bit annoying, mostly. I don't have a fever or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Good. No blood, no fever, no pain beyond the discomfort of initiating urination – that’s reassuring. Now, have you noticed any changes in how often you need to urinate, both during the day and at night?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… I think I’m going more often during the day. Not a huge amount more, but I definitely feel like I'm visiting the bathroom more frequently. At night, though… no, not really. I still only get up maybe once, sometimes not at all. It's mostly just the daytime thing, I think. I've been drinking about the same amount of water, I haven't changed that. I like my tea!
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency during the day, but nighttime frequency is unchanged. And your fluid intake hasn’t altered. To get a better understanding of the overall picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I had my gallbladder removed years ago, maybe thirty years now? And I had a bit of a problem with high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for ages. I take a small pill every morning. Aside from that, I’m pretty healthy, knock on wood! I don’t have any allergies that I know of, and I haven’t had any major surgeries recently. I used to have a lot of trouble with my knees, but I had both replaced about ten years ago, and those are doing fine now, thankfully. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Oh! And I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but that’s all. I think that’s everything. Do you want to know about my family history?
DOCTOR: That's a very thorough overview, Ms. Yadao, thank you. Knowing about the gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, knee replacements, and no allergies is very helpful. It’s good to hear you’re otherwise relatively healthy. And yes, if you wouldn’t mind, a little about your family history would be appreciated. Specifically, are there any instances of kidney problems, bladder issues, or prostate problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… let me think. My mother, she had diabetes, but I don’t have that. My father… he had a weak heart, and passed away young. My brother, he's perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And my uncle, on my mother’s side… he had some sort of trouble with his kidneys when he was older, but I don't remember exactly what it was. He needed dialysis for a while, I think. And that's about it, really. No one else that I can think of had any problems with their bladder or anything like that. My grandfather was very healthy, and my grandmothers… well, they lived long lives, but I don’t remember much about their medical problems. I’m not sure if that helps much. It wasn't something we talked about a lot, you know?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Yadao, thank you. Knowing about your mother’s diabetes, your father’s heart condition, and your uncle’s history of kidney problems requiring dialysis gives us a bit more of a picture. Given everything you’ve described – the straining, the intermittency, the incomplete emptying, the decreased force, and the increased daytime frequency – and with your uncle's history, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A physical examination seems like a good idea. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I don't want any surprises!
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will be a relatively straightforward examination. I will listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I will likely perform a gentle abdominal palpation – feeling your abdomen – to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I will also need to do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes. And finally, I'll likely perform a digital rectal exam – that’s an internal check of your rectum – to assess the prostate size and check for any masses or abnormalities. It can be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be quick. I will explain each step as I go. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A digital… examination? Well. That doesn't sound very pleasant, does it? I suppose if it’s necessary… yes, alright. But please be gentle! And explain everything, like you said. I get a bit nervous with these things, you know. I've never had one before. And please, tell me why you’re doing each part. Knowledge is power, as they say. And warn me before you touch anything! Honestly, it’s the not knowing that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. You are right to ask questions, and I will explain everything thoroughly and proceed with utmost care. We will take things at your pace. The digital rectal exam is important because it allows me to assess the size and shape of your prostate gland. Even in women, the prostate gland can affect bladder function due to its proximity. I’ll also be checking for any tenderness or masses. It will be quick, and I will warn you before each step. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me listen for any unusual sounds. I’ll then gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Listening to my tummy, then pressing it… and then that. Alright. Just… be gentle, please. And warn me. I really appreciate you explaining everything so carefully, Doctor. It does make me feel a bit better. Let’s get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will certainly be gentle, and I will warn you before each step. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie flat on your back, and I'll just place the stethoscope on your tummy. It won’t be cold, and it won’t hurt. Okay. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. No tenderness to palpation. That's good. Now, to complete the examination, I'm going to need to perform the digital rectal exam. I’m going to ask you to bend over and place your hands on the table. I will use a lubricant and a gloved finger to gently examine your rectum and prostate. As I said, I will warn you before I insert my finger. It will be a brief examination, and it may cause a slight urge to urinate or a feeling of pressure. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Right. This is it then. Yes… yes, I suppose I’m ready. But… a warning, you promised? And please, be quick. Honestly, I’m a bit embarrassed even having to discuss this. It’s just… not something you talk about with strangers, you know? Just… get it over with. And please, tell me if I should do anything, like breathe or anything?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your discomfort, Ms. Yadao, and I will proceed as quickly and gently as possible. I will absolutely give you a warning before I insert my finger, and I will tell you if there's anything you need to do. You can breathe normally throughout the examination. Taking deep breaths can actually help you relax. Okay. I’m going to insert my finger now. Just try to relax as much as possible. Okay. All done. I'm removing my finger now. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or tenderness. The rectal walls feel normal. Do you feel any discomfort now?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. A bit… intrusive, certainly. But not painful. No, I don’t feel any discomfort now, just… relieved it’s over. Slightly embarrassed, if I’m honest. What does “slightly enlarged” mean, though? Is that bad? And what now? Are you going to send me home? I hope not without some sort of explanation.
DOCTOR: I’m glad it wasn’t as unpleasant as you anticipated, Ms. Yadao, and I understand your feeling of embarrassment. “Slightly enlarged” means that your prostate gland is a bit larger than what we typically see in women your age. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it can contribute to the urinary symptoms you're experiencing – the straining, intermittency, and incomplete emptying – by putting pressure on the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder. To get a clearer picture and rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order a few tests. I'd like to do a urinalysis to check for infection or blood in your urine, and a PSA test – that’s a blood test to measure the level of prostate-specific antigen, which can be elevated in prostate enlargement or other prostate conditions. And, to further assess your bladder function, I'd like to order a post-void residual volume test - this will determine how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. More tests. Well, I suppose it’s better to be thorough. Urinalysis, PSA test, and… what was the other one? Post-void something or other. It all sounds a bit complicated, Doctor. Will these tests require another visit? And… will they be painful? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. Is there anything I can do at home in the meantime? Should I be drinking less water? Or more? Maybe avoid tea? I do like my tea, you know. And is there anything I should be looking for? Anything that would mean I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Yadao, and I apologize for the additional tests. But it's important to get a comprehensive assessment. The urinalysis and PSA test will be done with a simple blood draw – just a quick prick of the needle. The post-void residual volume test can be done in the clinic – you will urinate, and then we will use a handheld device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. It’s not painful at all, just a little bit inconvenient. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. Continue to drink your normal amount of water – don't restrict your fluids, as that can actually worsen your symptoms. And you don’t need to avoid tea. However, you may want to try to urinate every two to three hours, even if you don't feel a strong urge – this can help to empty your bladder more completely. Importantly, if you develop a fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen, or if you notice blood in your urine, please come back immediately. Also, if you are unable to urinate at all, that’s a reason to seek immediate medical attention. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the test results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. A week. I can manage that. No more tests than necessary, and no need to give up my tea. That’s good. And remember to drink normally… no blood, no fever, no back pain… or being unable to go at all. I think I can remember all that. So, the blood draw and… the thing in the clinic. And then we'll see what happens. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And very thorough, which I appreciate. I suppose I’ll just go and get those tests done, and then wait and see. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Forms to fill out, or… anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. There are no additional forms to fill out at this time. The front desk staff will schedule your blood draw and post-void residual volume test before you leave. They will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the tests. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I look forward to seeing you then. And remember, we're here to help. Have a good day, Ms. Yadao.
