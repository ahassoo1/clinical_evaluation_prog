DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… I keep… belching. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t… I don’t know why it’s happening. It just… burp …see? Like that.
DOCTOR: Oh, I understand. That is frustrating – and yes, I heard that. It’s good you’re talking about it. It's certainly something we can look into. How long has this been going on, Lucia?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… a month? It started… after a party, I think. But it hasn’t stopped. It’s not… all the time, but it happens a lot, especially after I eat. Sometimes even when I’m just… sitting. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month, starting around the time of a party. And it’s more noticeable after eating, but it can happen even when you're resting. That gives us a little something to work with. Can you describe what the belching feels like?
PATIENT: Um… it’s just… air. Like, a bubble coming up. Not painful, never painful. Just… loud. And… it makes me feel a little… full, even when I haven't eaten much. Like there's too much… something in my stomach. I don’t know how to explain it good.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a perfectly good explanation, Lucia. “Fullness” and air bubbles—I understand. Not painful, just uncomfortable. Has anything specific you’ve eaten seemed to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… maybe beans? And… soda. Definitely soda. But I drink soda a lot, so it's hard to say. I eat a lot of rice and chicken too, and that doesn't seem to bother it. Maybe spicy food? Yeah, spicy food sometimes makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so beans, soda, and spicy food seem to be triggers. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the belching?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Like… what do you mean? Like, feeling sick? No. No stomach pain, not really. Just… the belching. Sometimes I feel a little… bloated, I guess. Like my stomach is bigger than normal. But that’s it, I think. I don’t know. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, bloating is common with this kind of thing, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… no. Everything is… normal there. Maybe a little… slow sometimes? But I drink a lot of water, so… usually okay. I haven’t… I haven’t had any trouble with that. I hope I'm explaining everything good. It's hard for me to talk about.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Lucia. Really. It is sometimes hard to talk about these things, and you're explaining everything just fine. Okay, let's move on to some general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I can eat anything. I… I haven’t taken much medicine ever, really. Just… for a headache, sometimes. Nothing serious, never. And no bad reaction to anything. I think. I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like to take pills if I can help it. Just… sometimes a little bit of ibuprofen for a headache, but not much. That’s all. I try to stay healthy. I eat good food, mostly. Rice, chicken, vegetables…
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like ulcers, GERD, or anything else related to your stomach or digestive system?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've been pretty healthy, actually. I’ve had the flu a few times, and a cold… but nothing serious. My doctor back home… he always said I was strong. He said I had a good constitution. But he moved away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Lucia. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. Nothing like that. I… I don’t like hospitals. Just… check-ups. And… the dentist, of course. But no big surgeries. I've been lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just a couple more questions about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any history of digestive problems like ulcers, GERD, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother… she had trouble with her stomach sometimes. Always complaining. But I don't know what it was. She lived a long time, though. And my father… he had heartburn a lot, I think. But he didn't go to the doctor much. I don't know much about it, really. They didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? Do you mean… my job? I work in a factory, I'm an Industrial Engineering Technician. I check the machines and make sure everything is running good. It's… okay. Not too stressful. I live alone. And I… I don’t smoke, and I don’t do drugs. I like to listen to music and… cook. That's it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Lucia. So, you work in a factory, you live alone, you don't smoke or do drugs, and you enjoy music and cooking. That gives me a good picture. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and see if anything seems obviously off. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I hope you can find out what’s wrong with me. It’s just… embarrassing. But I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lucia. We'll figure this out. It’s good you came in. Okay, if you could lie back on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Here. Is this okay? I’m a little cold.
DOCTOR: Perfect, yes. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, I’m listening now. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds… no immediate signs of anything concerning. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just… a little pressure. Like… someone is pushing my stomach. But not bad. Not uncomfortable. Just… normal. It feels… okay. Like you said, just pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness or pain on palpation. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don't feel any masses. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything else is okay. Everything sounds clear there as well. Based on this quick exam, there’s no immediate cause for alarm. It sounds like what you’re experiencing is likely functional, meaning it’s related to how your digestive system is working, rather than a structural problem.
PATIENT: Functional? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Will I need… medicine? Or… surgery?
DOCTOR: "Functional" just means that there doesn’t seem to be anything physically wrong with your stomach or intestines. It’s more about how they’re functioning, rather than a disease or structural issue. And no, it doesn’t sound like you’ll need surgery. In most cases, we can manage this with lifestyle changes and, potentially, medication if needed. It’s often related to things like diet, stress, or how quickly you eat. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to start with a few simple tests. A stool test to rule out any infection, and a blood test to check for things like celiac disease and inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Tests… that’s okay. I guess. What… what will the tests show? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work tomorrow. I don’t want to miss too much work. Will the tests hurt?
DOCTOR: The tests won't hurt at all, Lucia. The stool test is just a sample you’ll collect at home—the lab will give you instructions, it's very straightforward. And the blood test is just a quick prick of the finger or arm, like you've probably had before. As for what they’ll show, the stool test will help rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. The blood test will help us check for things like celiac disease, which can cause digestive issues, and also look for any signs of inflammation. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a few things you can try on your own. First, try eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. Second, avoid carbonated beverages like soda. And third, try to identify any specific foods that seem to trigger your symptoms and avoid them. We can talk more about dietary changes once we have the test results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes. Smaller meals… no soda… and… try to find what foods make it worse. That sounds… okay. I can try that. Three to five days… that’s not too bad. And… what if the tests do show something? What if it is something serious? Will I need… a specialist?
DOCTOR: That's a valid question, Lucia. If the tests do show something, it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. It just means we have more information to work with. If it's something like celiac disease, we can manage it with a specific diet. If it's an infection, we can treat it with antibiotics. And if it's something more complex, we can refer you to a specialist – a gastroenterologist – who specializes in digestive disorders. I'll explain everything thoroughly, and we'll make a plan together. I want to reassure you that we're taking a cautious approach, and we're here to support you every step of the way. For now, let's focus on trying those initial changes – smaller meals, no soda, and identifying trigger foods. The lab is just down the hall. They'll give you the collection containers and instructions. Do you have any questions before you head down there?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think I understand. Smaller meals… no soda… trigger foods… tests… Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very good. I hope… I hope it's nothing too bad. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here for you, and we’ll figure this out together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get those test results back soon. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you the lab requisition forms. Take care, and I’ll see you in a week to discuss the results. .
