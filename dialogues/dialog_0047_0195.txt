DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Micucci. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. It's just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, you know? Or one of those encouraging ones. My daughter, she says I need something official from the doctor to show my sister. Honestly, the fuss she makes… It’s just a little cold.
DOCTOR: A…card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! Like you get when someone's sick. It’s for… appearances, really. My sister, she thinks I exaggerate everything. A simple “feel better soon” from a doctor would be very helpful. It’s not like I need treatment or anything, just… validation. Do you usually not do this sort of thing? It seems a bit… stingy, if you don’t mind my saying.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, with all due respect, my practice is dedicated to medical care. While I understand family dynamics can be…complicated, writing a note solely for reassurance isn’t standard procedure. However, I can document your visit, which will include my assessment of your condition. Would that be sufficient?
PATIENT: Assessment? For a little sniffle? Honestly, doctor, you make it sound like I’m on my deathbed. My sister will just say it’s a waste of her money if it’s a proper medical document. She’s very particular, you see. Look, can’t you just write “Mrs. Micucci reported feeling unwell and advised rest” on a nice card? It’s not like it’s a complicated request! Are you sure you can’t? It would really save a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I am a physician, not a stationery service. Providing a medical opinion requires a proper examination and assessment, and fabricating a statement without one is…unethical. I am happy to examine you and document my findings, which can serve as a record of your health status. But I will not create a note to appease your sister’s…concerns. Now, if you’d like to proceed with a medical consultation, I’m prepared to do so. Otherwise, I’m afraid I can’t be of further assistance.
PATIENT: Unethical? Goodness gracious. It’s just a card! You’d think I was asking for a limb! You know, I’ve never met a doctor so… inflexible. Honestly, it's a bit rude. Fine. Do whatever you want. But don’t expect me to come back. And don't be surprised if my sister tells everyone what a difficult doctor you are. It’s just a waste of a good morning, really.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Micucci. If you’ll allow me to begin, perhaps we can determine what’s causing this…illness, and document it appropriately. To start, can you describe your symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, honestly, it’s nothing much. Just a bit of a tickle in my throat, a little stuffy nose… and I feel a bit tired, naturally. But I’ve felt worse, let me assure you. It’s probably just the weather. Always gets me, this damp air. But if you must know specifics… yesterday I sneezed maybe three times. And my head feels a little…fuzzy. It’s not a headache, exactly. More like…a lack of sharpness. Does that make sense? Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. You’d think I was bedridden!
DOCTOR: And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms, Mrs. Micucci?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started, I suppose, about three days ago. Maybe four. It’s hard to say, really. Everything blurs together these days. I think it was after I helped my neighbor with her garden. She had these lovely roses, but all that bending over…probably strained something. It's not a constant thing, though. Some moments I feel perfectly fine, and then…the tickle returns. It's very intermittent. Honestly, I don’t usually bother with doctors for something so minor. But my daughter… well, you know how daughters are. Always fussing.
DOCTOR: And have you had any fever, cough, body aches, or any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Fever? No, absolutely not. I took my temperature yesterday, just to appease my daughter, and it was perfectly normal. Cough? A tiny little one, sometimes, just to clear my throat. Nothing serious. Body aches? No. A little bit of stiffness, perhaps, from the gardening, but that’s hardly an ache. And breathing? Perfectly fine, thank you very much. I walk up and down the stairs every day, don’t you know. No difficulty at all. Honestly, doctor, I feel like you’re looking for something that isn't there. It’s just a little cold, that’s all. A very minor one. Are we getting anywhere with this? Or should I just ask for the card again?
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Mrs. Micucci?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Oh, I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take a pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. But I don’t take it regularly, only when I need it. And then there’s a vitamin D supplement, my daughter insists on that. Says I don’t get enough sunshine. Honestly, it’s a whole regimen, if you ask me. But nothing major, really. Just the usual things for an old woman. Is this really necessary? We're not treating a life-threatening illness, you know.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, Mrs. Micucci?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve lived a long life, you know. I’ve eaten everything, touched everything, breathed everything. I’m not one of these delicate flowers. Perhaps a little bit of a sniffle with certain pollen, but that’s hardly an allergy. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, thank goodness. My sister, she’s the allergic one. Always carrying around an EpiPen. It’s quite dramatic, really. But me? No allergies. Perfectly robust, I assure you. Are we nearly done? This is taking a very long time for something so trivial.
DOCTOR: And what about your past medical history, Mrs. Micucci?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? I’ve had the usual things, you know. A little bit of arthritis, as I mentioned. A bout of the flu here and there. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was ages ago. Nothing serious, really. I had a difficult childbirth with my son, but that was decades ago. And I had a broken wrist when I was a child, falling out of a tree. But honestly, doctor, I’ve lived a long and healthy life. I’m not someone who’s constantly sick. I’m perfectly robust, as I keep saying. Are we getting anywhere with this? Or should I just ask for the card again? It would be much quicker, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Micucci. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Just to be thorough. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But don’t expect much, doctor. It’s just a little cold, you know. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you repeatedly. Is that deep enough? Honestly, it’s quite cold. And it tickles.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, Mrs. Micucci. Heart rate is regular. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, could you open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ahhhhh. There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, it's quite bright in here. And it’s a bit uncomfortable, sticking things in my mouth. I don’t see what good this is doing, but if you must… Are we nearly finished? My daughter is going to be expecting me back soon. And she’ll be very upset if I don’t have a card.
DOCTOR: Your throat is mildly inflamed, consistent with a viral infection. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it appears you have a common cold, Mrs. Micucci. It's likely self-limiting and should resolve within a week or so. Rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers should be sufficient. I am not prepared to provide a “Get Well” card. However, I can document this assessment in your medical record. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A common cold? Well, I could have told you that myself! Hours of examination for something I already knew! And you won’t write a simple card? Honestly, doctor, your bedside manner is appalling. A medical record? What good is that to my sister? She wants official reassurance, a card, not some complicated medical jargon. Fine. Do whatever you want. But don’t expect me to recommend you to anyone. It’s a waste of a perfectly good morning, really. .
