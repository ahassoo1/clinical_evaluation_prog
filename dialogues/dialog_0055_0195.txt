DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I am Dr. Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Pleasure? Honestly. It's just...well, my niece said I should come. Said a doctor could write me a little card. A "get well" card, she called it. Seems silly, doesn’t it? I feel perfectly fine. But she insisted. A bit much, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A note from a doctor, you say?
PATIENT: No, not a note exactly. Just...a card. You know, with flowers on it, maybe? Something to show my sister I'm taking care of myself. She worries too much. Always has. Thinks a little sniffle means I'm on my deathbed. It’s very dramatic.
DOCTOR: I see. And what specifically prompted your niece to suggest you come in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it was just last week. I was helping her with her garden, deadheading the roses, and I felt a little tired afterwards. Just a normal tired, you know? Like after a long day. But she started fussing. Said my color was off. Said I should “get it checked out.” Honestly, the girl watches too many television dramas.
DOCTOR: And has this fatigue been a persistent issue, or was it isolated to that particular day?
PATIENT: Persistent? Goodness, no. It was one day! I do a lot of things, you know. I help my husband with his workshop, I cook for the family, I keep the house tidy… I’m not one to sit around feeling sorry for myself. It was just...after the gardening. Maybe I bent over too much. I don't know. It's not like I've been laid up in bed with it.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I don’t…I don't go around looking for symptoms, doctor. I feel…normal. A little ache in my knees sometimes, but that’s just getting older, isn’t it? And I get a bit breathless going upstairs, but honestly, who doesn’t? It's a long flight of stairs.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's try to be a bit more specific. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? Oh, goodness, yes! My husband started making this new curry, very spicy, and I haven't been able to eat as much of it. It’s a bit too much for my stomach. But that’s not a symptom, is it? It's just...a bad curry. He’s trying, bless him, but he really needs to lay off the chili peppers.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, I hope so! I had a bit of a sweet tooth over the winter, you know, all those festive sweets… I’ve been trying to cut back. So, yes, I’m probably a little lighter. But it's not like I’ve wasted away to nothing. Just a few pounds. Honestly, doctor, are you sure you need to ask so many questions? This is about a card, isn't it?
DOCTOR: A thorough medical history is always necessary, Ms. Micucci, even for seemingly minor concerns. Now, regarding your breathing…you mentioned getting breathless on the stairs. Has this been a recent development, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing, I suppose. Always been a bit out of breath on the stairs. I wasn't a sporty girl as a child, you know. Preferred reading to running. And this house…it’s an old house, lots of stairs. It’s not like I’m climbing Everest! Though, honestly, some days it feels like it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no! I believe in a healthy diet and fresh air. And a bit of common sense. Never been one for popping pills. My mother always said, "Let food be your medicine," and I’ve always lived by that. Though I do take a little something for my knees now and then, when they’re particularly bad. A herbal remedy, my sister-in-law makes.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, no, not really. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes with dust, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? And I can’t eat shellfish, but that’s more of a…dislike, really. Makes me feel quite sick, it does. But allergic? No. I’m a pretty robust woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, Ms. Micucci. Just to get a better overall picture. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well, alright, I suppose. Though honestly, I’m not sure what good poking and prodding will do. I told you, I’m perfectly fine. But if you insist…just be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And do be quick about it. I have a lot to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Right. A heart listen. Sounds rather dramatic, doesn’t it? Very like those television dramas my niece watches. Honestly, I feel perfectly… Oh, wait a minute. Is that a draft? It’s awfully chilly in here. Could you close the window, please? I don't want to catch a cold. That would really upset my sister.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. And I do detect some mild wheezing in your lungs…but again, nothing overly concerning. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Goodness me. Well, no wonder. It is rather dusty in here, even with the window closed. All those old books my husband collects…they’re lovely, but they do make a mess. And I was gardening yesterday, you know. Lots of pollen in the roses. Though I wouldn’t say it’s wheezing, exactly. More of a…a little rattle, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Now, I’d like to check your oxygen saturation with this small clip on your finger. It won't hurt.
PATIENT: Oh, high blood pressure. Well, that's my husband, I'm sure of it. Always making salty snacks! He means well, bless him, but he does love his seasonings. And wheezing, you say? Honestly, doctor, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. But alright, go ahead with your little clip. Just don’t poke me too hard, alright? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Your oxygen levels are a little low, Ms. Micucci. And, in conjunction with the elevated blood pressure and wheezing, I think it’s important to investigate this further. It could be several things…perhaps a mild chest infection, or even early signs of something more serious.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Serious? Now you’re really frightening me, doctor! I just came for a card! A get well card, of all things. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps, but who doesn’t get tired? And my husband’s cooking does give me a bit of indigestion, but that’s hardly a serious medical condition, is it? I think I need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a basic blood work panel to rule out any underlying issues. And I recommend you follow up with a pulmonologist, if possible.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray?! And blood work?! Oh, goodness gracious. Honestly, doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I think I'm going to be sick. Look, I appreciate your concern, truly I do. But this is all a bit much. I came for a card, a silly little card! Not…not a full medical workup. I’m going home. I think I need to lie down. And I’m definitely not following up with a pulmonologist. I feel perfectly fine! A little tired, maybe, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your reluctance. However, I am obligated to prioritize your health and safety. While you may feel fine, the objective data suggests otherwise. I strongly advise against dismissing these findings. I can provide you with a list of pulmonologists in the area, and schedule a preliminary appointment for you, if you wish. If you absolutely refuse further investigation, I must advise you to monitor your symptoms closely, and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen. I will document your refusal in your chart. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Look. I’ll…I’ll talk to my husband. He’s good with these things. He reads a lot of medical journals. But…no appointments. No X-rays. Not yet. I’ll…I’ll take some herbal tea. My sister-in-law swears by it. And I’ll…I’ll avoid the gardening for a while. Is that alright? Can we just…forget about the X-rays and the…pulmonologist? Just…a card, please. A simple get well card.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. I will document our conversation. I can write a note stating you have been evaluated, and are currently stable, but recommend ongoing monitoring of your symptoms. This will not be a ‘get well’ card, per se, but a medical summary. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A summary…yes. A summary is fine. As long as it doesn’t say…anything alarming. Just…that I was seen. And…that I’m feeling…okay. Mostly. And…could it perhaps have flowers on it? Just a small bouquet? It’s for my sister, you see. She worries so. Please?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. I will see what I can do regarding the flowers. I'll have the medical assistant prepare the summary and bring it to you. In the meantime, I strongly urge you to reconsider the pulmonologist referral. But, ultimately, the decision is yours. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No…no, I think that’s all. Just…thank you. For…everything. Even the…the worrying bits. And thank you for the flowers. I’m sure my sister will be very pleased. I think I’ll just…go home now. And lie down. Thank you again, doctor.
