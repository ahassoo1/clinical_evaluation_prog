DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... well, it's a bit hard to explain, to be honest. My hearing keeps going, and then coming back, and I get really dizzy with it. It’s been happening on and off, and my family… they’ve had trouble with their ears too, I think. But my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. It's alright, we'll take our time and try to figure things out. So, you're experiencing episodes of hearing loss and dizziness. When did this start happening, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? Let me think… It feels like it's been a while. Maybe… a few months, perhaps? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, you see. One day I’m fine, the next… whoosh, everything spins. It’s not constant, thankfully. I wish I could give you a better answer, but it’s all a bit fuzzy. Do you need a specific date?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, a general timeframe is helpful. So, a few months of intermittent hearing loss and dizziness. Can you describe the dizziness for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, the room just starts spinning, like you've had too much to drink, but I don't drink! It makes me feel very unsteady, like I'm going to fall. It usually happens when the hearing goes, but not always. And it can last… sometimes just a few minutes, sometimes longer. It's unsettling, very unsettling. I have to sit down quickly, usually. And everything sounds muffled when my hearing goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds quite distressing, Ms. Mayhugh. Intermittent spinning sensation, unsteady gait, and muffled hearing accompanying the episodes. Does anything seem to trigger these episodes – certain movements, loud noises, stress, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? That’s a good question. I don't think so. Nothing that I've noticed, anyway. It just… happens. Sometimes I’m just sitting quietly, and it starts. Sometimes I'm walking, but not always. I haven’t been particularly stressed lately, no. Maybe… maybe if I move my head quickly? But I can’t be sure. It’s hard to pinpoint. Honestly, Doctor, it’s very random. It keeps me on edge, always wondering when the next one will hit.
DOCTOR: Alright, random onset with no clear triggers is good to note. And you said your family has had ear trouble?
PATIENT: Yes, my family… my husband, before he passed, he had terrible ringing in his ears. And my sister, she had… I think it was vertigo, yes, that’s it. She had to go to a specialist. It’s not a new thing, this ear trouble, in my family. But it was different for them, I think. They… they always knew what was causing it. Mine just… comes and goes. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of tinnitus and vertigo is helpful information. Let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have Medicare, so I must have something, right? I think… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but they put me on a little pill for it. I take that every day. And… oh, and my knees are bad, very bad. Arthritis, I think. But other than that… I can’t really think of anything. I don’t go to the doctor much, honestly. I just try to get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication and arthritis are important to know. And you’ve been managing well otherwise. Are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just the little white pill for my blood pressure. Nothing else. Sometimes I take something for the pain in my knees, but that’s just when it’s really bad. It's over the counter, you can buy it at the shop. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. But I don’t take it every day, just when I need to.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just the blood pressure medication regularly, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I used to eat everything! The doctor checked years ago, I think, when I started getting the blood pressure pill, and said I was fine. No itchy skin, no trouble breathing, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Let’s move on to a brief examination. I’d like to take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look in your ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle with my ears, please. They’re rather sensitive, you know. And I might flinch a bit if you come at me too quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, I will be very gentle. Alright, your heart and lungs sound good. Now, looking in your ears… I see a little bit of cerumen – earwax – but nothing major. The eardrum looks intact, but slightly… dull. I'm also noting some fluid behind the eardrum on both sides. It’s subtle, but present. I’m also going to check your balance and coordination with a few simple tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… fluid? That doesn’t sound good, does it? Dull eardrum… I haven't the faintest idea what any of that means, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. Balance tests… yes, alright. If you think it will help, go ahead. I probably won't be very good at them, though. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. Let's proceed with the balance tests, and then we’ll discuss what this all means. Alright, you have a little bit of difficulty with balance, but it's not dramatic. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Meniere's disease, or possibly vestibular neuritis. Both can cause episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The fluid I saw behind your eardrums is consistent with this. It’s important to note that this is a preliminary assessment, and we'll need further testing to confirm it. I'd like to order an audiogram – a hearing test – and possibly an MRI to rule out other causes. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Meniere’s disease? That sounds… frightening. Fullness in the ear? I do feel a bit blocked sometimes, yes. And I’ve definitely been feeling unsteady. Testing… yes, alright. If you think it's necessary, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. An MRI… is that safe? I've heard things… But if you think it’s important, I’ll do it. Just… explain everything to me, please? I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh, I’ll explain everything. MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It uses a strong magnet and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your head. It’s a very safe procedure – there’s no radiation involved. We'll ask you a few questions about your medical history beforehand to make sure it's safe for you. The machine is quite large, and it can be noisy, but you'll be able to hear me throughout the procedure. Now, regarding Meniere’s disease, it’s a condition of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus – ringing in the ears – and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The cause isn’t fully understood, but it's thought to be related to a buildup of fluid in the inner ear. Vestibular neuritis is similar, but it affects the vestibular nerve, which controls balance. The audiogram will help us assess the extent of your hearing loss. The MRI will help us rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, such as a tumor. I’m going to write you a referral for both tests. The sooner we get these done, the sooner we can have a definitive diagnosis and start treatment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and salty foods, as these can sometimes worsen symptoms. I’ll also prescribe meclizine, a medication that can help with the dizziness. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… no caffeine, alcohol, and salt… that will be difficult. But I understand. I need to get better, so I will try. Meclizine… for the dizziness… alright. No radiation is good to know. It’s just… a lot to take in. So, no caffeine, salt, alcohol, take the meclizine, get the tests… and then we’ll see? It sounds… complicated. I think… I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it. I just… I just want to feel normal again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It is a bit complicated, but we’ll take it one step at a time. And I understand your desire to feel normal again – that’s my goal too. I’m going to print out the referral orders and a sheet with instructions about the meclizine. The meclizine can cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. It’s also important to stay hydrated while taking it. If your dizziness becomes severe or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, headache, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here are the papers. Have a good day, Ms. Mayhugh. And remember, we’re here to help.
