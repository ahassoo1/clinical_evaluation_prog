DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Moshe. Well, it's this sleepiness, really. Even with the machine, I’m just… tired all the time during the day. It’s a bit of a bother, to be honest. I thought getting treated for the sleep apnea would fix it, but it hasn’t quite.
DOCTOR: Okay, Moshe. I understand. You're still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite using a machine for your sleep apnea. Let's try to figure out what's going on. First, can you tell me a little more about how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like falling asleep standing up, you know? More like a heavy… dragging feeling. Hard to concentrate, hard to get motivated. I find myself dozing off in my chair after lunch sometimes, even if it's just for a few minutes. And it's not a refreshing sleep, either. I wake up feeling… groggy, still tired. It makes it hard to enjoy things, really. I used to love reading in the afternoons, but now I just… feel sluggish. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Moshe. It sounds very frustrating. The grogginess even after napping is definitely something we need to look into. Now, how long has this been going on, even with the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… probably about six months now. I started using the machine in January, and for the first couple of months, it was wonderful. I felt like a new man, honestly. But then… slowly, the tiredness crept back. It wasn't sudden, you understand. Just a gradual return of the sleepiness. Now it's pretty much back to how it was before, maybe a little less severe, but still… noticeable. I was hoping it would just get better with time, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months now. And you said it was initially very helpful, then gradually lessened. That’s useful information. Let's talk about the machine itself for a moment. Do you know what your AHI – your Apnea-Hypopnea Index – is currently?
PATIENT: AHI? Oh dear… I’m afraid I haven’t the faintest idea. The doctor who originally diagnosed me explained it, of course, but it didn’t really stick. Something about how many times I stopped breathing… but I just don’t remember the numbers. I’ve been going for regular check-ups, and they always say the machine is working okay, but I’ve never asked for the actual number. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is important. It tells us how well the machine is controlling your sleep apnea. Let me quickly check your records here… Okay, your last AHI reading from three months ago was 7. That’s… not bad, but it’s also not ideal. We generally aim for under 5. So, the machine is working, but perhaps not optimally. Now, besides the sleepiness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Seven, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose that explains things a bit. Alright. Other changes… Let me see. My wife, God rest her soul, used to complain about my snoring, but that’s gone, of course, since I have the machine. And I don't wake up with headaches anymore, which is a blessing. But… I have been feeling a bit more… irritable lately, I think. Snappish with my friends, even. And my memory… it's not what it used to be, but then again, at my age, who expects it to be? It’s just… little things, mostly. Forgetting appointments, misplacing my glasses… nothing major. I mostly chalk it up to getting older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no snoring, no headaches – that’s good. Irritability and some memory issues… those could be related to sleep, or other things, of course. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. I see here you have high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s all correct. High blood pressure, takes a little pill every morning. And the arthritis is mostly in my knees, makes it a bit hard to get around sometimes, but nothing debilitating. I try to stay active, go for walks when the weather is nice. The doctor keeps telling me to lose weight, but it’s easier said than done, you know? I enjoy my food a little too much, I suppose. Are those things important for the sleepiness, Doctor?
DOCTOR: They absolutely can be, Moshe. Both high blood pressure and arthritis can affect sleep, and weight can certainly play a role. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I take something for my knees, a pain reliever. It’s naproxen, I believe. Just as needed, when they really bother me. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little something to help, but I don’t do that very often. It’s just… a half a tablet of lorazepam, if I’m really tossing and turning. But like I said, not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. I don’t want to get dependent on it, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen as needed for your knees, and occasional lorazepam for sleep. That’s good information to have. We'll need to consider those as well. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual, alright? Old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145/88, but not drastically so. Pulse is regular at 78. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to take a look at your throat and check your neck. Your throat looks fine, no obvious swelling. Your neck feels normal. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Okay, everything seems generally normal. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. It could be that your AHI needs to be better controlled, or that something else is contributing to your sleepiness. I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Blood tests seem sensible. Vitamin D, thyroid… alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? And thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind and patient. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Moshe. I understand. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab results usually take a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a slightly higher dose of your CPAP machine setting, just to see if that makes a difference. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you’re feeling. Does that sound good?
