DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sadhu, welcome. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s this cough. It just won’t go away. Been hacking and wheezing for… well, a good month now, I’d say. It's tiring, you know? Especially with… well, with my heart not being what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A month, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Started mild, just a little tickle, but it’s gotten worse. Especially when I lie down to sleep. I have to prop myself up with pillows, otherwise I just can't breathe. It's funny, my husband, God rest his soul, used to say the same thing. He had a bad heart too, you see. Always needing extra pillows.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said your heart… isn’t what it used to be. Do you have a cardiologist?
PATIENT: Oh yes, Doctor. Dr. Ramirez. A very nice young woman. I see her every six months or so. She's the one who told me about the… the heart failure, it was about five years ago now. She's the one who put me on the water pills, you know, to get rid of the extra fluid. They help, mostly, but this cough… it feels different. It’s… wetter, if that makes sense. And it brings up a little bit of… well, it's yellowish sometimes. Not all the time, mind you.
DOCTOR: Yellowish mucus… okay. And you're taking those water pills regularly, as Dr. Ramirez prescribed?
PATIENT: Every morning, Doctor. Right after breakfast. I set an alarm, you know, just to be sure. I don’t want to forget. My memory’s still pretty good, thankfully, but sometimes… sometimes things slip my mind. But the pills, I haven’t missed a dose in… well, a long time. I take two of them, every day. Furosemide, that's the name, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Furosemide. Good. And besides the cough and shortness of breath, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little. Not terrible, but definitely some. I used to get it much worse before I started the pills, but it comes and goes, you see. Worse at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet cooking. I run a little tamale stand, you know. Down by the market. It keeps me busy, but… well, it's hard work. And sometimes, after a long day, my ankles are puffy like balloons.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever or chills. And I haven't had any night sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually, even with the cough. Just have to get comfortable with all the pillows, you know? It’s just… this cough is so persistent. And it’s tiring me out. Makes it hard to stand on my feet all day, even making tamales. I worry it’s more than just a little cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a listen to your lungs and check things out physically. Then we can think about what might be going on. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My old body isn't what it used to be, but I try to take care of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath… and out. Alright. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. And a few crackles too. Your breathing sounds a bit labored. And as you mentioned, some swelling in your ankles. It's mild, but definitely present. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, and pulse is 88 and regular. Given your history of heart failure, the cough, the wheezing, and the swelling, it sounds like your heart failure might be a little bit worse than usual. We need to rule out other things, though. Have you had a chest X-ray recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? My heart acting up again… No, Doctor, I haven't had a chest X-ray recently. The last one was… let me think… about a year ago, I believe. Dr. Ramirez ordered it then, just to check things out. Everything was stable then, she said. But that was a year ago. I do get short of breath sometimes, even when I am taking my pills. I just figured it was my age, you know? Getting old ain't for the faint of heart, as they say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your symptoms and the time since your last chest X-ray, I think we need to get one done today. That will help us see if there’s any fluid buildup in your lungs, or if there's something else going on. We also need to check your blood levels - a CBC to check for infection, and a BNP to see how your heart is doing. And, I'm going to order an EKG just to be on the safe side. It could be a simple exacerbation of your heart failure, but we need to rule out pneumonia or other possibilities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Pneumonia… that would be serious. I don’t have a fever, but I suppose it's still possible. An EKG and blood tests… and the X-ray. Yes. Let's get it done. I just want to feel better. This cough is really wearing me down, and I need to be strong to run my tamale stand. My customers depend on me, you see. They say my tamales are the best in the county.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood and take you over to radiology for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take too long. After that, we’ll review the results and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. It might help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It’s a temporary measure until we get the results back. And, just to be cautious, if you experience any severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds good. Something to help me breathe a little easier. Yes, I think I can manage that. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse… yes, I understand. My daughter, Elena, lives nearby. She can take me if I need to go. No, Doctor, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… get this done. Let's find out what's going on. I'm ready when you are. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse come in right away. She'll get you set up. And we will figure this out, Mrs. Sadhu. Don't you worry. Nurse Rodriguez?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're a good man.
