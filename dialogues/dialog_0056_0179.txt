DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It is... a pleasure. Well, it is the words, you see. They… do not come so easily now. It is very frustrating. I forget things, too, but mostly the words. It has been happening for… some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having trouble finding the right words, and it's been going on for a while. That is frustrating. Just to clarify, when you say "some time," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… let me see. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It is difficult to say exactly. Time… it feels different these days. It began slowly, I think. Not noticing at first. Now… it is more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer. And it started gradually, becoming more noticeable over time. That’s helpful. Can you describe how it feels when you can't find the words?
PATIENT: It is… like the word is on the tip of my tongue. I know what I want to say. I can see the… the thing in my mind. But the word… it is hidden. Sometimes, it comes after a long pause. Other times… it does not come at all. It is very… unsettling. Like a part of me is missing.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating and unsettling. It's good you're able to describe it like that. Do you notice this happening more in certain situations?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. Hmm. I believe so, yes. When I am tired, it is much worse. And if I am… speaking quickly. I must slow down. If I try to rush, the words… they disappear completely. Also, sometimes when I am with… many people. It is strange. I feel… flustered, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse when you're tired, speaking quickly, or in social situations with a lot of people. That gives us some clues. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this difficulty finding words?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. My wife… she passed away last year. It has been… difficult, naturally. I feel… sad, of course. And sometimes, I forget where I put things. Not important things, usually. Just… keys, or glasses. Is that what you mean? I am not sure. I sometimes feel… a little confused. But I do not know if that is from the sadness, or something else.
DOCTOR: That's very important information, Sherrell. Losing your wife last year is a huge loss, and it's completely understandable that you're still grieving and experiencing difficulties. It’s very common for grief to cause memory and concentration issues. Let's talk about the memory issues. Besides the keys and glasses, are there any other memory problems you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes, I have trouble remembering… names. Not always, but… if I meet someone new, and do not speak to them again quickly, I forget their name. It is embarrassing. Also, I repeat myself sometimes. My daughter… she points it out. I will ask her a question, and then ask the same question five minutes later. I do not mean to, it just… happens. It is very frustrating for her, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting names and repeating questions. Those are things we should definitely look into. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. I have… high blood pressure, I believe. I take a pill for it, every morning. Also… the doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high, a few years ago. I try to eat healthy, but it is difficult. My wife… she was the good cook. I am not so good. I do not have… the sugar problem, I think. The doctor would have told me, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, your doctor would have told you if you had diabetes. Okay, high blood pressure medication, that's good to know. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: The name… oh dear. That is… difficult. It is a white pill. Small, I think. I get it filled at the pharmacy, every month. I… I am so sorry. I should know this, shouldn’t I? My daughter… she helps me with these things. I really cannot recall the name, Doctor. It begins with an “A”, perhaps? I am very unsure.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sherrell. It's perfectly okay not to remember the name. We can look it up in your records. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I take the pill for my blood pressure, and… sometimes, I take something for a headache. But no… no allergies. I do not have any problems with… foods, or animals, or anything like that. I am quite fortunate, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she was a little forgetful in her later years. But I think it was just… old age. She lived to be ninety-two. My father… he was very sharp, right until the end. No… I do not recall anyone in the family with… the bad memory disease, as you say. My aunt… she had a stroke, many years ago. But that is different, yes? I am not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some forgetfulness in your mother, but no known history of dementia or Alzheimer's. That's helpful. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical and neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. If it will help, then please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. I just… want to understand what is happening. It is unsettling, this feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, those are normal. Now I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that… strong enough? I do not feel as strong as I used to. It is probably just… old age, yes? Everything feels a little… slower these days.
DOCTOR: Your grip is a little weaker than expected for your age, but not significantly. Now, can you please close your eyes and tell me what I am holding?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: What is this?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is… long and thin. It has a… a point on the end. I believe… it is a pen. For writing. Yes, a pen. Is that correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. That's good. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat a few words after me. I'll say three words, and then you tell me what they were. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please, tell me the words. I will try my best to remember. It has been… difficult lately, but I will try.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, orange. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Hmm… table… penny… and… orange. Is that correct, Doctor? I… I believe so. It feels… distant, somehow. Like trying to grasp a dream. Table… penny… orange. I hope I have remembered correctly.
DOCTOR: Yes, you got them all correct! Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your day, just to assess your orientation. Do you know what day it is today?
PATIENT: Hmm… today… let me see. It is… August? Yes, I think so. August the… second? I believe that is correct. August second. Is that right, Doctor? It is difficult to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. August 2nd. And do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… the year… Oh dear. Is it… 2024? No… I believe it is… 2025. Yes, 2025. Is that correct, Doctor? I am so sorry. I should know this, shouldn’t I? My mind feels… foggy.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is 2025. That’s alright, Sherrell. It's good you got it eventually. Okay, one last question. Can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… we are… in a doctor’s office, yes? A clinic. A very nice clinic. It is… urban, I believe. I saw the shops outside. A city clinic. Is that correct, Doctor? I am not very good with details, I am afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. You're doing very well. Okay, Sherrell, that's all the quick testing for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, you're experiencing some cognitive changes, particularly with memory recall and word finding. The neurological exam was largely normal, which is reassuring. But the changes are enough that we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to this. And I'd also like to order a brain MRI to get a more detailed look at your brain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help to understand what is happening, then please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. Blood tests and… an MRI. I just… want to know what is going on. It is unsettling, this feeling. Is it… something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Sherrell. It's too early to say definitively whether it's serious. Many things can cause these symptoms, and not all of them are severe. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. The MRI is primarily to rule out any structural issues in the brain. We’re looking for things like small strokes, tumors, or evidence of atrophy. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend some cognitive exercises you can do at home to help keep your brain active. I’ll have my nurse print out a handout with some suggestions. And I'd like you to try to avoid situations that cause you significant stress or anxiety, as that can worsen your symptoms. Would you like me to explain anything further, or do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Blood tests and an MRI. And… exercises. I will try my best. I… I appreciate your kindness. It is… unsettling, but you have made me feel… a little calmer. Perhaps it is just… old age, as I said. But it is good to know what is going on. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It's my job to help you understand what's going on. And it could be related to age, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. My nurse, Maria, will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the MRI. She'll also give you the handout with the cognitive exercises. I’ll review the results of your tests as soon as they come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
