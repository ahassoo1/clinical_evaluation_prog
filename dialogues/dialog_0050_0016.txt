DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Welcome to the clinic. I see you’re 58 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's about the bruising. I've been on this blood thinner for… well, it feels like forever, since my wife passed, and lately, I’ve been black and blue for no good reason. A little bump here, a little scrape there… nothing like this used to happen. It's quite bothersome, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. Bruising easily when on a blood thinner is certainly something we need to investigate. “Feels like forever” isn’t particularly helpful for medical documentation, however. Could you be more precise as to how long you’ve been on the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, doctor, you and your precision. It's been… let me think. She passed in… 2018, I believe. So, roughly seven years now. Seven years of this stuff. Is that precise enough for you? It feels like a lifetime, if you want to know the truth. And I take it exactly as prescribed, mind you. I’m very diligent about these things. Unlike some people, I actually listen to my doctors.
DOCTOR: Seven years. That is helpful, thank you. And you state you are very compliant with the medication regimen?
PATIENT: Compliant? Is that what you call it? Yes. Absolutely. Every single day, same time, same dose. I even set an alarm, you know. I don’t miss a thing. My wife… well, she always said I was a stickler for rules. And I suppose that hasn’t changed. It’s just… concerning to bruise like this despite doing everything right. It makes one wonder what the point of taking it is, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It is certainly frustrating when adherence to a medication doesn’t yield the expected results, Mr. Farson. Let’s delve a bit deeper into these bruising episodes. Could you describe a recent instance?
PATIENT: Well, just yesterday, actually. I was… rearranging some books in the study - a perfectly harmless activity, I assure you - and I bumped my shin against the leg of the table. Not a hard bump, mind you. A little tap, really. But now? It’s the size of a grapefruit. A proper, ugly bruise. And it hurt. Not terribly, but enough to notice. It's not like I went tumbling down the stairs, you know. It's just… too much reaction for such a minor incident. It's almost comical, if it wasn’t so worrying.
DOCTOR: I see. A grapefruit-sized bruise from a minor bump to the shin. And this is a new development, or has this been happening gradually over the seven years?
PATIENT: No, no. Definitely new. For the first few years, it was just… a little color, maybe. A small mark. Easily explained, you understand. But these last few months… it’s gotten progressively worse. Bigger bruises, appearing with less and less provocation. It started with a slightly tender elbow after gardening, then a dark spot on my thigh after simply leaning against the doorframe. Now this shin. It’s… unsettling. Makes a man feel quite fragile, to be honest. Like an old piece of glass, ready to shatter.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. A sudden increase in bruising, despite consistent medication adherence, warrants investigation. Now, let’s move on to a more comprehensive review. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I haven’t felt any… dizziness, or shortness of breath. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums. No unusual fatigue, though I am getting older, so feeling a bit tired is hardly a revelation. Just… the bruising. And frankly, a bit of worry. It’s a nagging thing, really. I’m a practical man, Doctor, not one to fuss over every little ache and pain, but this… this feels different. It's like something is off.
DOCTOR: No associated symptoms of bleeding elsewhere. Good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well, let's see. I take a statin for my cholesterol, and a small dose of something for my blood pressure. Nothing fancy, really. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. But that’s about it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, you understand. I’m not one for self-medicating. My wife always said I was too stubborn to ask for help. A bit of truth to that, I suppose. I manage the pain with heat packs mostly.
DOCTOR: Statin, medication for blood pressure, and occasional ibuprofen. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies, thankfully. My wife was the one with the sensitivities. Always had to be careful what she ate, what she touched. Me? I can eat just about anything. Though I do try to avoid cilantro – that stuff tastes like soap, in my opinion. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I’ve never had a proper reaction to anything, not that I recall. I pride myself on having a strong constitution, you see. Or at least, I used to. This bruising is making me question everything.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. Now, let’s briefly discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back. Everything was fine, thank goodness. And I had a bout of pneumonia when I was traveling in Guatemala, many years ago. A nasty thing, that was. Aside from that, nothing much. I've been quite healthy, all things considered. I used to walk every morning, before my arthritis got bad. I take care of myself, Doctor. I always have. That’s why I find this whole situation so… perplexing. A healthy man shouldn’t bruise like this. It just doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: Benign prostate exam, pneumonia many years ago. And you mentioned arthritis. Is that in your legs, or elsewhere?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees and hips, Doctor. It flares up now and then. The ibuprofen helps, as I said. It's just… an old man's ailment, really. Nothing to write home about. Though it does limit my mobility, which isn't helping matters, I'm sure. I used to be a very active man. This has… slowed me down considerably. And frankly, I don't like it one bit. A man needs to do things, you know? Sitting around is a recipe for trouble. But I suppose I'm rambling. Are we getting anywhere with this bruising? I'm starting to feel like a bit of a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: You are not being a hypochondriac, Mr. Farson. It is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about a sudden change in your health. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as bleeding disorders or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had… diabetes, I believe. And my father, he had heart trouble. Both passed away in their eighties, fairly peacefully, all things considered. As for bleeding disorders… not that I know of. We weren’t a family to discuss such things. Guatemalan families tend to keep these things… private, you understand. It wasn’t something you openly talked about. As for cancer… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had breast cancer, many years ago. But that’s about it. Not a particularly illustrious medical history, thankfully. Is that helpful? I’m not sure how much detail I can provide, to be honest. It's all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, heart trouble, and a family history of breast cancer. Thank you. Now, one final section, if you don't mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Are you asking if I drink or smoke? Because I don't. Never have. My wife… well, she didn’t approve. And I’ve always been a fairly… reserved individual. I don’t go to bars, I don’t gamble. I prefer quiet evenings at home with a good book, or tending to my garden. I used to travel a bit, but that’s gotten more difficult lately, with my arthritis. I live alone, as you probably gathered. My wife passed away five years ago, as I mentioned. It’s… quiet, to say the least. Is that the sort of thing you were looking for? I’m not much of a social butterfly, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That provides a complete picture. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and carefully examine the areas where you've been experiencing bruising. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I’m not particularly fond of doctors, mind you – never have been – but I understand it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle. My arthritis makes things a bit… sensitive. And try not to take too long. I have a rather nice book waiting for me at home. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your current stress levels. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Hmm. This bruise is quite extensive, as you described. Tenderness is present, but no signs of active bleeding. No swelling or warmth. I see some smaller bruises on your forearms, consistent with your description. No significant findings beyond the reported bruising and slightly elevated blood pressure. I am going to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to assess your blood thinner levels and function, and a basic metabolic panel. We will also check your kidney and liver function. This will help us determine the cause of the increased bruising. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood work… well, it’s not pleasant, but necessary, I suppose. As long as it gets to the bottom of this. I’m just anxious to get back to my reading. When can I expect the results? And will I need to come back for another visit? I do dislike making unnecessary trips, you understand. A man’s time is valuable, even an old man’s time.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. The lab will contact me directly with the results. I will then review them and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I suspect we will need to discuss adjusting your medication dosage or investigating other potential causes, depending on what we find. In the meantime, if you experience any significant bleeding, such as nosebleeds that won't stop, blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bruising, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly. Significant bleeding… I understand. No stopping nosebleeds, blood in… well, you’ve made yourself quite clear. I’m a practical man, I assure you. I’ll keep a close eye on things. And I’ll await your call. Thank you for your time, and for not keeping me here any longer than necessary. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a book calling my name. .
