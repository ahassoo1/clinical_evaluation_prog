DOCTOR: Right. So, Mr. Kingan, you’re here today… because?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. The tryouts. For the team. Need to get checked out, I guess. Just a physical, right? Want to get this over with, honestly.
DOCTOR: Tryouts. Yes, yes. A physical. Look, I have a rather full schedule, so if you could just… be concise. Any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… hmm. Not really. Old sports injury, knee, years ago. Doesn’t bother me much anymore. And I get winded easy, but… I’m 62. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: Sixty-two is a condition, Mr. Kingan. But alright. Knee injury… when, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh, gosh. Probably… 1983? Maybe '84? A long time ago. Football. College. Nothing broken, just… torn something. They taped it up. I kept playing.
DOCTOR: Right. Torn something. Vague. And the… winded easily?
PATIENT: Well, I get outta breath climbing stairs, okay? Or running for the bus. Normal 62-year-old stuff. Not like, collapsing-on-the-field winded, just… takes me a minute. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have some detail, Mr. Kingan. Alright, let’s just get this over with. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes… standard procedure. Please, have a seat on the exam table.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Exam table. Whatever gets this done quicker.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart rate is… elevated, but that could be from the… anticipation. Lungs are clear, though a bit diminished breath sounds. Not unexpected. Reflexes are… present, albeit slow. Let's check your knee. Which side?
PATIENT: The left one. It’s the one that bothers me sometimes. Not a lot, just… feels a little stiff in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some crepitus, a little tenderness to palpation along the medial joint line. Range of motion is… limited. Not severely, but definitely not what it should be for someone your age. Alright. And any other complaints?
PATIENT: Other complaints… uh… my back sometimes aches. Nothing terrible. Just… old age, probably. I lift things, you know? Gotta do things around the house. Doesn't stop me.
DOCTOR: "Old age." Right. And how long has this back pain been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Years. On and off. Worse when I bend over. Like when I'm gardening. It'll stiffen up, then go away after a bit. Not a constant thing. Really, I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, vague knee discomfort, occasional back pain… Look, Mr. Kingan, I'm going to be blunt. You're not exactly a spring chicken. These tryouts… are you sure this is a good idea?
PATIENT: Well, that's… rude. I can still play. I've been staying active. Look, I just need a form signed, okay? I'm not asking for a miracle. Just tell me if I'm cleared or not.
DOCTOR: Fine. I'll need you to understand the risks. Given your… history, and my assessment, participating in strenuous activity could exacerbate your existing conditions. I strongly advise against it. However, if you insist, I’ll document my findings and release you with a signed form, but it will state that you’ve been informed of the potential complications. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. I understand. Document everything, whatever. I'm willing to take the risk. I just want to play. Form signed, right? Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Here. Read it carefully. It's a liability release. I am documenting vague knee discomfort, occasional back pain, diminished breath sounds, and an elevated heart rate. I strongly recommend consulting with a specialist before engaging in any strenuous physical activity. And frankly, I think you should reconsider. Sign here.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I’m signing it. Sheesh. There. Done. Can I go now?
