DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest notion why I’m here. My… daughter, I believe, scheduled this appointment. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s terribly inconvenient, you know. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Right. Your daughter scheduled it… and you're experiencing some…vision and hearing issues. Vague, okay. Look, I've got patients backed up all day, so let's try to be a little more specific, alright?
PATIENT: Specific? Really, Doctor? I told you, I don't remember being particularly unable to see or hear. It just… happened. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Old age, I presume. Though, I do recall struggling to read the newspaper this morning. And the television was rather loud, perhaps. But I assure you, I've always had excellent senses. It’s probably just a temporary affliction. Can we not simply write a prescription and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Julie, "probably nothing" isn't a diagnosis. And I’m not just handing out prescriptions for things I don't understand. We need to rule out anything serious. Tell me… how long have you been noticing this trouble with the newspaper and television?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A day, maybe? Two? It truly isn't worth all this fuss. I've been rather preoccupied with… matters. My granddaughter's wedding, you see. A very important event. I simply can’t recall the precise moment it began. Honestly, these questions are quite… tedious. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Tedious or not, we need to cover some basics. Okay. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, perhaps. A faint… buzzing. Though, it could simply be the ventilation system, you know. This building isn’t exactly state-of-the-art. It's a rather irritating noise, now that I think about it. But I hardly believe it's cause for alarm.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Balance problems? Doctor, I have always had perfect posture. And a very strong core, thank you very much. I used to be a ballroom dancer, you know. Though, I suppose… I did stumble slightly yesterday. But I attribute that to these ridiculous new shoes. They simply aren't supportive enough. Honestly, the quality of footwear these days is appalling. It certainly wasn’t a matter of… dizziness. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Let’s just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: An exam? Must we? I haven't the time for… poking and prodding. But very well. If you insist. Just please be gentle, Doctor. I bruise easily. And do hurry. I have a luncheon appointment, you see. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat. I’m going to check your ears first. Hmm. A little wax buildup, but nothing concerning. Now, I'm going to check your eyes. Follow my pen with your eyes, don't blink. Okay. And now I'm going to check your balance. Stand with your feet together, arms at your side. Close your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness! See? This is precisely what I was talking about! I told you something wasn’t right. This is utterly ridiculous. I am perfectly capable, thank you very much. I suspect your equipment is faulty. Or perhaps you haven’t had enough coffee this morning. Honestly, Doctor… this is quite undignified. I feel faint. .
DOCTOR: Woah there. Okay, alright. That wasn’t ideal. It seems like you do have some balance issues, and potentially some vision and hearing decline. It’s nothing to be alarmed about, but we need to investigate further. I’m going to order a full audiological exam and a referral to an ophthalmologist.
