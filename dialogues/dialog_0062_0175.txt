DOCTOR: Hi Michae, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it’s my… my back. It’s been pretty painful lately. Not sure what I did, to be honest. Just kinda started hurting a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days ago… that's good to know. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s a dull ache mostly, right across my lower back. But when I bend over, or try to twist, that’s when it really stings. Like a sharp pain for a second, then back to the ache. It's worse in the mornings too, getting out of bed is… not fun.
DOCTOR: Got it. Dull ache with sharp pains when you move, and worse in the mornings… Okay. And would you say it radiates anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiates? You mean… does it go anywhere else? Let me think… sometimes it feels a little bit funny down my left leg, kinda like a tingling. Not always, though. Mostly just in my back. Is that what you mean by radiates? Sorry, I’m not really good with all the medical words.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright! Yes, that tingling down your leg is exactly what I meant. It’s good you pointed that out. So, tingling in your left leg, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, just the left one. Not the right. It’s not constant, mind you. It comes and goes. Sometimes I don’t even notice it. But when the back pain is really bad, that’s when I feel it the most in my leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Michae. Okay, so lower back pain, dull ache, sharp with movement, worse in the mornings, and tingling that comes and goes in your left leg when the back pain is bad. Have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve had little aches and pains here and there, getting older you know… but nothing like this. This is… different. It’s keeping me up at night a little bit, too, trying to find a comfortable position.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you had any recent injuries, falls, or changes in activity level before this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not that I can think of. Nothing major. I’ve been doing a little gardening lately, maybe that has something to do with it? Just bending over a lot, pulling weeds and stuff. But I do that every year and haven’t had this problem before. I haven't fallen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening… good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. I try to walk every day. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, I think. I don't have diabetes or anything like that. Nothing serious, anyway. I haven't been to a doctor in a few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know about the controlled blood pressure and that you're staying active. And no major past illnesses. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my allergies sometimes, when the pollen is bad. Cetirizine, I think it’s called? And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, but not regularly. That’s about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Cetirizine for allergies and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications specifically?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've taken different things over the years for colds and stuff, and never had any problems. I'm pretty sure I'm good there. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That is important, thank you for letting me know. Okay, and just to finish up with some background, do you have any family history of back problems, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis in her hands, pretty bad towards the end. And I think my grandfather had some trouble with his back when he was older, but I don't know much about it. He didn't talk about it much. Other than that, not that I'm aware of. We didn't really talk about medical things much in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Michae. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your range of motion, reflexes, and feel around your back. It won't be too uncomfortable, I promise. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully it’s nothing serious. I just want to be able to get back to gardening!
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on your stomach for me, please. I'm going to start by just feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Okay, does this feel tender anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… right there. That's a little sore. Not excruciating, but definitely uncomfortable. And a little bit… tight, I guess. Does that make sense? It feels kinda… knotted up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel that tightness as well. And it does seem tender to the touch there. Okay, can you slowly bend forward for me, and tell me if you feel any pain with that movement?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah… that definitely stings. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a stretching, pulling feeling. And it’s worse the further I bend. Right in that same spot. It’s not… unbearable, but I definitely feel it. There we go. That’s where it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, now can you gently bend to the right, and then to the left, and let me know if you feel any pain with those movements as well?
PATIENT: To the right is okay… a little bit of a stretch, but nothing bad. But to the left… Ooh, that’s definitely worse. The same pain, but more intense. It feels like something is pulling on my back when I bend to the left. There we go. That left side is really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, if you could carefully roll onto your back for me, please. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs, and do a little straight leg raise test to see if that causes any pain. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I hope it’s not too bad. My legs feel okay, though. I haven’t had any tingling in my legs, just in my back. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, your reflexes seem normal in both legs. Now, I’m going to lift your left leg straight up, keeping it straight, and see if that causes any pain down your leg or in your back. Let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Not bad… just a little stretch. It doesn’t hurt right now. Wait… yeah, now I’m starting to feel it. That ache in my lower back is coming back. Not sharp, just that dull ache. And a little bit of that tingling down my left leg. It’s not terrible, but I definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Michae. Okay, and when I lower it back down?
PATIENT: When you lower it down… the ache kind of stays there, in my back. The tingling fades a little bit, but it’s still there, just very faint. It feels like… pulling on something. It’s a weird feeling. Like it’s irritated something in my back.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Michae. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a lumbar strain, potentially with some mild radiculopathy – meaning irritation of a nerve root in your lower back, which explains the tingling down your leg. It’s likely related to the gardening you’ve been doing and the repetitive bending. It’s good that you don’t have any numbness or weakness in your legs, which would be concerning. Your reflexes are normal, which is also a good sign. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of osteoporosis, or any other conditions that might weaken your bones?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not that I know of. My mother had some arthritis, but no osteoporosis. I've never been told I have weak bones or anything like that. I try to eat healthy, get enough calcium. I don’t really drink a lot of soda, if that makes a difference. But no, no history of osteoporosis or anything like that. I’ve never had a bone scan or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Given your history and the exam findings, I'm reasonably confident this is a muscle strain with some nerve irritation. I'd like to order a simple X-ray of your lower back just to rule out any fractures or other structural problems, especially since you're experiencing some pain with movement. It’s a precaution, but I think it's best to be thorough. In the meantime, I recommend the following: rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities. Gentle stretching may also help, but stop if it causes any pain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, ibuprofen… okay, I can do that. No heavy lifting, definitely. I'll be careful. An X-ray sounds good, just to be sure. Um… how long should I rest for? And what if it doesn’t get better with the rest and ibuprofen? Should I come back then? And is there anything else I can do besides ice and stretching? Like, is there a specific way I should be sitting or sleeping? I sleep on my side, usually.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Michae. Let’s tackle those one by one. For the rest, I'd recommend avoiding strenuous activities for at least a week, maybe two. You can gradually increase your activity level as your pain subsides. Listen to your body – if it hurts, stop. If your pain doesn’t improve after a week of rest, ice, and ibuprofen, or if it gets worse, definitely come back and see me. We may need to consider further imaging, like an MRI, or refer you to a physical therapist. As for sleeping position, sleeping on your side with a pillow between your knees can help keep your spine aligned. You can also try placing a pillow under your lower back for extra support. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as that can put extra stress on your back. You can also try gentle heat after the first couple of days, if that feels better than ice. And there are some over-the-counter muscle relaxants that may help, but I would recommend talking to me before taking those, as they can have side effects. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Pillow between the knees, pillow under my back, avoid stomach sleeping… I can do that. And come back if it doesn’t get better. I’ll try the heat after a few days. Okay, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll get the X-ray scheduled and try to take it easy. Hopefully I can get back to gardening soon!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Michae. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get that X-ray ordered for you, and we can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. I hope you feel better soon, and yes, hopefully you’ll be back to gardening in no time! Take care of yourself.
