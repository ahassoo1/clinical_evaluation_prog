DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lab work, right? That's what the lady on the phone said. Just… some blood tests. Honestly, I don’t really remember why exactly. Medicare sent something, I think. Just want to get it over with, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Medicare often orders routine tests, yes. But it's helpful for me to know what we're looking for. Do you have any specific concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not that I recall. Everything feels… okay, I suppose. Old, mostly. But that’s just… being my age, isn’t it? I haven't been sick sick, not recently. Is there something wrong with just wanting the tests done? I just want to make sure everything's… ticking along, you know?
DOCTOR: No, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to be proactive. It’s just… more efficient if I have some idea of what we're investigating. Alright. Let's start with a general review. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels… Hmm. Well, I’m always tired, to be honest. But… is that new tired? I don't know. It’s hard to say. I mostly sit around these days. Used to be more… active. Power plant work, you know? Lots of walking. Now… not so much. Does that answer your question? I'm really not good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… It comes and goes, to be perfectly honest. Some days I could eat a horse, other days… not even a biscuit. Nothing regular about it. I mostly eat whatever's easiest, though. Soup, mostly. Don't have much energy for cooking these days. Is that… bad? Should I be eating more? I really don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but changes in appetite can be indicative of other issues. Alright. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, gosh. That's… a good question. I haven't really been weighing myself. I think I’ve lost a bit, yes. My clothes feel a little looser, if that means anything. But I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, I honestly can't remember the last time. I suppose it’s not a huge amount, but… yeah. Some weight, I think. I just never bothered with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your bathroom habits. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… now you're asking about that? Well… they're… regular enough, I suppose. Nothing drastically different. Maybe a bit… slower, perhaps? But I’m an old man, Doctor. Things slow down, don’t they? I really don’t like talking about this, if you don’t mind. Is this important? Can we just get to the blood work?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Croonquist, but I understand your discomfort. Very well. We can move on, but it’s important to be thorough. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? No! No, I haven't. Definitely not. Oh, goodness, no. I would remember that. No blood. Please, let’s just… let’s just get this over with, okay? I’m starting to feel a bit… flustered. I’m really not a fan of doctors, you see. It all feels a bit… invasive. Is the blood work going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We will proceed. No need to get upset. Just a routine blood work, as you said. Before we do that, one final question – have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No fevers. No chills. No night sweats. Thank goodness. Just… normal old man stuff, I assure you. Just tired, a bit shaky sometimes, and forgetful. That’s about it. Can we please do the blood work now? I'm starting to feel lightheaded just talking about all this. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Follow me. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, room three. I’ll need to review your chart while you're getting that done. They'll draw a few vials of blood. And after that, we can discuss the results. Though, honestly, based on what you've told me… it sounds like we're just dealing with age-related changes. But we need the blood work to confirm. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel unwell at any point.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Room three, right. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I'll just… go find it. Just… hope it doesn’t take too long. And please… try not to find anything too terrible, alright? .
