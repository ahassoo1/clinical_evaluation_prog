DOCTOR: Hi Lyman, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I suppose. Not sure how long, exactly. Time gets away from you, you know? It’s just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does fly. Okay, so a shaking, primarily in your hand, that’s been going on for some time. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… Hmm. It’s worse when I try to do things. Like, holding a cup… or, I used to tinker with things, small engines and such, but it’s hard now. Everything just… wobbles. It’s not constant, though. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable. Other times… well, other times it’s a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with activity, particularly fine motor skills like holding a cup or tinkering. And it comes and goes—sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes more pronounced. Has it been getting progressively worse, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Progressively… Oh, dear. That’s a good question. I think… I think it’s a bit worse. Hard to say for sure. I don’t pay much attention to these things, to be honest. I just try to ignore it and get on with things. But, yeah, maybe a little worse. It’s been… noticeable longer, if that makes sense? I used to be able to hide it pretty well.
DOCTOR: That makes sense – noticing it for a longer period of time is helpful information. And trying to push through is very common. Do you notice it happening more on one hand than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely the right hand. My left hand is… fine, mostly. I mean, I'm 79 years old, everything aches a little, but the shaking… it's almost always the right one. I used to be right-handed, always have been, and I guess that’s just where it decided to show up.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the right hand, which has always been your dominant hand. That's good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, I’ve been a little… unsteady on my feet lately. Not falling, mind you, but a bit wobbly. And sometimes… I feel like my voice is a little quieter than it used to be. Hard to tell if that’s just old age, though. Everything’s getting quieter, it seems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unsteadiness on your feet and a feeling of a quieter voice. And you're wondering if some of it might just be related to age, which is a perfectly valid thought. Have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your hand or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Stiffness… sometimes, yes. A little bit in the fingers, mostly. Not a lot of pain, though. More of an ache, like after a long day. And my whole body feels… tired, a lot of the time. But I figure that's just getting old too, to be honest. I used to work at the water treatment plant, pretty physical job, and I suppose it took its toll.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stiffness and aching in the fingers, and general fatigue. Working at the water treatment plant sounds physically demanding. Before we do a quick exam, let me ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh boy. That’s a long list, I reckon. High blood pressure, I think they told me once. And… arthritis, maybe? Something in the joints. I don't really keep track of these things. I go to the doctor when something really bothers me, and they give me a pill, and I take it. That’s about it. Never really asked too many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and some arthritis are what you recall. That’s helpful. Do you remember any surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I had a hernia repaired, years ago. That was… painful. I don't remember much else, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and I've had a few bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing major, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a hernia repair. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had trouble walking when she got older. Real wobbly, like I said I've been getting. I think it was something with her nerves, maybe? And my father… he just sort of faded away, you know? Old age, mostly. Nothing specific I remember, really. We weren't a family that talked much about health.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had trouble walking later in life, and your father declined with age. Not much specific information there, but it’s helpful to know. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure. And something for my arthritis, a small white one. And… I think that’s it. Just those two, regularly. Sometimes I take something for my stomach, if it’s bothering me, but not all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for blood pressure, one for arthritis, and something for your stomach as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. My wife, bless her soul, she was always careful about allergies. I just… ate what she gave me. She’s gone now, divorced, long story. Didn't get along. But she was good about the allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing that. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and also look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your reflexes… …and balance. Could you please stand and try to touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Ooh… it’s harder than it looks. Getting old, you know. Everything’s a bit… wobbly. And this hand… it just shakes. See?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor, and it's more pronounced when you try to move. And it looks like you have some difficulty with coordination. Now, let's look at your hands. No significant swelling or joint changes. The tremor appears to be a resting tremor, meaning it's more noticeable when your hand is relaxed. Okay, thank you. That gives me a good starting point.
PATIENT: A resting tremor… What does that mean? Is it bad? I just want it to stop shaking. It's annoying, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration – wanting it to stop is completely reasonable. A resting tremor is a tremor that occurs when your muscles are at rest. It can be caused by a number of things. Based on your symptoms – the tremor, the stiffness, the unsteadiness, and the slight difficulty with coordination – it’s raising a possibility of Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s too early to say for certain. We need to do some further testing to confirm.
PATIENT: Parkinson’s…? Oh dear. Is that… serious? My sister-in-law had that, I think. She… ended up in a wheelchair. Is that what happens? I don't want to end up in a wheelchair.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, especially knowing someone who had Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disorder, meaning it gets worse over time. The symptoms can vary significantly from person to person. Your sister-in-law's experience is certainly one possible course, but not everyone progresses that quickly or severely. We need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with you before we jump to any conclusions. I'd like to order a scan, an MRI of your brain to rule out other potential causes of the tremor. And I'm going to order blood work to look for any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… and more blood work… Oh, bother. More tests. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s happening. And if it is this Parkinson’s… what can be done about it? Can you fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I wish I could give you a simple answer. Unfortunately, there's no cure for Parkinson’s disease at this time. However, there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. These include medications to help control the tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement, as well as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The goal of treatment is to help you maintain your independence and function for as long as possible. We’ll discuss all your options in detail once we have the results of the MRI and blood work. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests scheduled. Do you have any trouble getting to appointments, or would you need assistance with transportation?
PATIENT: Transportation… No, my neighbor, old Mr. Henderson, he usually helps me out. Good man. He drives me where I need to go. So, no, I can get there. Just… when will I get the results? I don’t like waiting.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about Mr. Henderson – having a reliable ride is a huge help. The MRI and blood work results typically take about a week to come back. My office will call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, and we’ll work together to find the best way to manage whatever’s going on. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… get it over with quickly, if you can. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. The staff will contact you to schedule those tests. Thank you for coming in today, Lyman. I’ll see you in about a week, once the results are back.
PATIENT: .
