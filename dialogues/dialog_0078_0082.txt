DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's good to meet you. Why don't we start with you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. Yeah, the travel... thing. My wife... she would have done all this. Bookings and... papers. I just... need to go. Somewhere. Nepal, I think? For a visit. It's... complicated.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you need a medical evaluation to ensure you're fit for travel, specifically to Nepal. And it seems like you're handling a lot of arrangements yourself, which can be stressful. Let's take things one step at a time. To help me understand your needs, could you tell me a bit more about why you need to travel to Nepal?
PATIENT: Why...? Well, it's... her family. My wife's family. She... passed away a few months ago. I promised her I would go. Visit them. See her sister... and the kids. It's... important. But I don't know... what I need for the trip. She always took care of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. That’s a very meaningful reason to travel, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed taking on these arrangements now. We will get through this together. To ensure your trip is as safe and smooth as possible, we need to assess your overall health. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical... things? Not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes. Working… building the airplane parts is hard work. But… no doctor ever said anything wrong with me. My wife… she had some problems, but… not me. I'm pretty strong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you generally feel healthy. Even without a formal diagnosis, it's helpful for me to get a complete picture. When you say you get a little tired, is it just from the physical exertion of work, or is it a fatigue that lingers even after rest?
PATIENT: Hmm... lingers... yeah, maybe a little. Even on days off, sometimes I just… don't have much energy. It's not like I'm sick, I just... don't feel like doing much. I just want to sit. Watch TV. My wife... she would always tell me to go outside, get some air.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Fatigue, even on rest days, can have a number of causes, and we’ll want to explore that a bit further. Let's do a quick review of your systems. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Changes...? Not really. I eat... food. When I'm hungry. Maybe not as much as before… since she… left. But I haven't lost… a lot. Weight... I think it's the same. I don't really look.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common for appetite and weight to fluctuate with significant life changes. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever...? No. Not a fever. I get… warm sometimes. After work. From the sun, maybe. Night sweats...? I... I don't know. I sleep pretty deeply. I don't usually wake up sweating. She… she used to wake up a lot. But not me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any coughs, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Cough...? No. I sometimes… clear my throat. From the dust, at the factory. Chest pain...? No. I lift heavy things all day. Muscles get sore, sometimes. But… not pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to ask about your bowel habits and urinary habits. Have you noticed any changes in either of those recently?
PATIENT: Uh... changes...? Look, is this… important? I mean, I go to the… bathroom. Like everyone else. Maybe a little less… regular since she… passed. But… is that something I need to tell a doctor? I'm going to Nepal, not…
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell, it is important. Even seemingly small changes can be indicators of underlying issues, and it's better to be thorough, especially when planning international travel. It helps us ensure you're in the best possible health for your trip. So, you've noticed you're a little less regular than usual since your wife passed away?
PATIENT: ...Yeah. Okay. Less… regular. Sometimes I have trouble… going. And when I do… it's… not like before. Harder. Sorry. It's… not a nice thing to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Odell. You’re not alone in experiencing these kinds of changes, especially with the stress you've been under. And you’re doing the right thing by telling me. It's important information. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. My wife... she took a lot of pills. For her… problems. But I don't need anything. I'm strong. I just… need to go to Nepal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies...? No. Not that I know of. I work with… dust all day. Never had a problem. Sometimes I sneeze. But everyone sneezes, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, everyone sneezes! Okay, good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke...? No. Never. My wife… she didn't like it. Alcohol...? Sometimes. A little beer. When I'm with friends. Not much. Drugs...? No. Never. I work hard. I don't need… that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little about your work environment?
PATIENT: Work...? It's… hard. Building airplane parts. Lots of metal. Lots of… noise. We wear ear protectors. It's dusty. And hot. Long hours. I need the money. It's… important. To visit her family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: …Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I just want to know if I’m… good to go. Nepal… is waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, which could be from anxiety or the stress you've been under. Your pulse is normal at 72, and your temperature is 98.6. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight murmur in your heart. It's likely benign, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears and throat look normal. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some tenderness in the lower abdomen. Is that where you've been experiencing discomfort?
PATIENT: ...Yeah. That's it. Down there. It's… hard to explain. Just… not right. Feels… tight. Especially when I… try.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is the discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Worse after… work. When I’m tired. And… sometimes when I… try to go to the bathroom. It’s… not easy. Not like before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms – the tenderness in your lower abdomen, the difficulty with bowel movements, and the feeling of tightness, along with the change in your energy levels – I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a urinalysis, and a stool test. These tests will help us rule out any infection or other underlying medical conditions. I also want to check your prostate-specific antigen level, just as a precaution, given the tenderness and difficulty with urination. It's a routine test for men your age. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests...? So… something is wrong? I just want to go to Nepal. What… what if I can’t go? If I'm… sick?
DOCTOR: Odell, let's not jump to conclusions. Running these tests doesn't automatically mean something is wrong. It simply means we're being thorough and taking the necessary steps to ensure your health and safety, especially given your travel plans. It’s possible the tests will come back normal, and we can clear you for travel. But it’s also important to rule out any potential issues that could become problematic during your trip. We'll take things one step at a time. The lab work will give us more information, and then we can discuss the best course of action. I will schedule you for the lab work now. We will have the results back within 3 to 5 business days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: ...Alright. Okay. Three to five days… That’s… a long time. What if… what if it’s bad? If I can't go to Nepal… what will I tell her family?
DOCTOR: Odell, let’s focus on getting the results first. Worrying about “what ifs” won’t help us. We'll address any concerns once we have a clearer picture. I understand this is a very emotional situation, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. If the tests reveal a concern, we will discuss all of your options and develop a plan that’s best for your health. We can also explore ways to communicate with her family, if needed. I will make sure to explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. In the meantime, I want you to focus on taking care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and try to manage your stress. I’ll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case we need a specialist’s opinion. Having that referral in hand will expedite things if it turns out to be necessary. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: ...Yeah. Okay. A reasonable plan. Gastroenterologist… I don’t even know what that is. Just… tell me when I can go to Nepal. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. That's what we're working towards. A gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in the digestive system. It’s just a precaution, to get another opinion if needed. Once we have the lab results, I will call you immediately to discuss them. We will review the findings together and determine if any further testing or treatment is necessary. And then, we will make a decision about your travel plans. I will also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the lab results, so you have all the information you need. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done. I have the paperwork ready for you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: ...No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. I will get you all set up and get you on your way. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. The lab is just down the hall, and they're expecting you. Once you’re done, you can go home and rest. I wish you all the best, and I will be in touch soon. And please remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you every step of the way.
