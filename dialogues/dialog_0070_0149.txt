DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor… Abady, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s about… all this fuss, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She thinks I need to see someone about my feet. I don't see what the bother is. They’re feet! People walk on them, don’t they? It's just… a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara. It's good that your daughter is looking out for you, though. Even if it seems minor, it’s always best to get things checked out. Perhaps you could tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, she means well, she really does. Always fussing. And it’s not nothing, exactly. They just… ache, sometimes. A dull ache, mostly when I’ve been on them too long. I used to be a dancer, you know. A very good dancer. Back in Haiti. But that was… a long time ago. Now I mostly sit. And they ache then, too. Honestly, I think it's just old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: I see. A dancer, that's wonderful! It sounds like you were quite active. And you're right, aches and pains can certainly come with age. However, since you're experiencing this discomfort, even if you suspect it's just age-related, it's good we’re looking into it. Could you describe the location of the ache?
PATIENT: Location? Well, it's… all over, really. Not one specific spot. Sometimes it’s in the heel, sometimes it’s up towards the toes. It moves around. Honestly, Doctor, it’s like trying to catch smoke. It’s just… annoying. And my daughter keeps telling me I need “tests” and “interventions.” I don’t even know what that means.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. “Tests” simply help us understand what’s causing the pain, and “interventions” are just the ways we might try to help alleviate it. Since it moves around, that does make it a bit trickier. Do you notice anything that makes the pain worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse? Standing, definitely. Being on my feet for any length of time. Shopping is a nightmare. And… well, sometimes just walking around the house. Better? Sitting, mostly. Putting my feet up. A warm bath helps, a little. But not much, really. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve just gotten used to it. It’s just… there. Like an old friend, a rather grumpy one.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like the pain is aggravated by weight-bearing activities and relieved by rest and elevation. That’s helpful information. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or changes in the shape of your feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh, sometimes. A little. Especially at the end of the day. Nothing dramatic, you understand. Just… a bit puffy. And redness… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. I’m not one for staring at my feet, if you catch my drift. Changes in shape… now that I haven’t noticed. They look like… feet. Old feet, perhaps. But still feet.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Gunasekara. It's good you haven’t noticed any significant changes in shape. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I have a bit of… trouble with my blood sugar, the doctor says. Not diabetes, exactly, but… pre-diabetes, I think she called it. And my blood pressure isn’t what it used to be. But really, Doctor, I’m 83 years old! What do you expect? A little wear and tear is to be expected, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Gunasekara. A little wear and tear is perfectly normal at your age. It’s good that you’re aware of the pre-diabetes and blood pressure issues, though. We’ll want to keep those in mind. Are you currently taking any medications for those conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… my daughter handles most of that, bless her heart. I take a little pill for the blood pressure, a small white one. And something orange for the sugar. And… oh, a vitamin D supplement, she says I’m not getting enough sun. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a whole handful of pills every morning. Sometimes I forget if I’ve taken them or not!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s common to have trouble remembering medications. We can review those to make sure everything is correct. Now, before we do a quick physical exam of your feet, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. A little bit of a rash sometimes, but nothing serious. And my daughter always checks everything before I take it, so I trust her judgment. Though, I did have a funny reaction to a seafood dish once… but that was years ago, and I suspect it was just a bad oyster.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Gunasekara. Alright, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your feet. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks, and then I’ll just do a brief examination to assess the condition of your feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you want me to take off my shoes? Really? It’s rather… undignified, isn’t it? I suppose it can’t be helped. But don’t expect anything pretty, Doctor. These feet have seen better days.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Ms. Gunasekara. We’re simply assessing what’s causing your discomfort. It doesn't have to be pretty, just informative. Alright, I’m just going to gently feel around your feet now. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh, be careful! Yes, that’s a bit… sensitive. And over here, on the side. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. It's been like that for a while, honestly. My daughter says it's probably a callus, but I don't see why I need a doctor for a bit of hard skin.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see a callus forming here on your heel, and a bit on the side as well. And you’re right, there’s some mild swelling around your ankle. I also notice your toenails are a bit thicker than usual. This can sometimes be related to circulation, or just age. Let me just check the pulses in your feet. Your pulses are present, but a little weak. This isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we should keep an eye on, especially with your history of pre-diabetes.
PATIENT: Weak pulses? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? My grandfather… he had terrible circulation. He lost a toe, you know. Is that what’s going to happen to me? Am I going to lose a toe?
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not jump to any conclusions, Ms. Gunasekara. Weak pulses don’t automatically mean you’ll lose a toe. They simply mean we need to pay attention to your circulation and take steps to improve it. Your grandfather’s situation was likely different, and we're catching this early. Based on what I’ve seen today – the callus, the mild swelling, the weak pulses, and your history of pre-diabetes – it appears you may have some early signs of peripheral artery disease, which means there’s some reduced blood flow to your feet. However, we can manage this with proper care. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple blood test to check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. And an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, which measures the blood flow in your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a science experiment. But… if you think it’s necessary. My daughter will be pleased you’re being thorough. What will these tests tell you, exactly? And… will they hurt? I don't do well with needles, you understand. And I certainly don’t want anything that involves cutting!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. I assure you, these tests are quite simple and shouldn’t be painful at all. The blood test will help us monitor your blood sugar and cholesterol levels, which are important for overall health and circulation. It’s just a small prick of a needle, and it’s usually over very quickly. The ABI is even simpler. It doesn’t involve any needles at all. We’ll just use a special cuff to measure the blood pressure in your arm and your ankles. It’s completely painless and non-invasive. The results of these tests will help us determine the extent of the reduced blood flow, if any, and guide our treatment plan. We may recommend lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, or medication to improve circulation. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? At my age? What lifestyle? I mostly sit and read. And I certainly don't have the energy for strenuous exercise. But… alright. If you insist. Explain them to me, then. But make it quick, Doctor. My stories are waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ll be brief. The blood test is standard – we just need a small sample to check your sugar and cholesterol. The ABI – Ankle-Brachial Index – is very simple. We’ll place cuffs on your arm and your ankles, similar to a blood pressure cuff. It measures the blood flow by comparing the pressure in your ankles to the pressure in your arm. It takes about ten minutes, and you can just relax while we do it. The goal is simply to see if there’s any significant blockage in the arteries of your legs and feet. If there is, we can discuss options like medication, and – perhaps, if appropriate – referral to a specialist. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and the ABI. The lab is just down the hall, and they can schedule you for the ABI at their center. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Down the hall… alright. As long as I don’t have to walk too far. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And you're not going to make me diet, are you? Because I simply must have my afternoon tea and biscuits. Very well. Write me the referral, then. But if this involves too much walking or changing my habits, I'm blaming you, Doctor. And my daughter. She'll probably agree with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. No drastic changes, I promise. We'll take things one step at a time. And I'll make sure the lab is as close as possible. No blame necessary. Here you are. The lab is just two doors down, and they'll schedule you for the ABI. They'll likely ask you to avoid caffeine for a few hours before the test. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them together and create a plan that works for you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Gunasekara?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… don't expect miracles, Doctor. I’m an old woman, and these feet have seen better days. And tell your staff to be gentle. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Very well. I suppose I’ll go get this over with. Thank you, Doctor. For… well, for trying.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. We’ll take excellent care of you. And please, take your time. Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Gunasekara. I look forward to discussing the results with you.
PATIENT: .
