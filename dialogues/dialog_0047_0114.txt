DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this breathing. It gets...difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I believe. Perhaps a month. It’s rather bothersome when I’m trying to rest.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Right. And when you lie flat, what exactly feels difficult?
PATIENT: It feels...like there's a weight. A heaviness on my chest, and it’s hard to get a full breath. Not a pain, exactly, just…effort. Like I’m working too hard to breathe, even when I’m not doing anything. I usually prop myself up with pillows to get comfortable again. Several pillows, I might add.
DOCTOR: Several pillows… Alright. And has this difficulty breathing been constant for the past month, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly at night, when I lie down. During the day, if I'm sitting or standing, I don't notice it much. Though sometimes, after a lot of walking, it feels a little tighter. But the real trouble is when I try to get comfortable in bed. It makes it hard to sleep, naturally.
DOCTOR: Naturally. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Now that you mention it...yes, a little. My shoes have been feeling a bit snug lately. Not terrible, but I did have to loosen the laces a bit. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest. It's been quite warm.
DOCTOR: The heat can certainly contribute. And are you coughing at all?
PATIENT: A little. Just a small cough, now and then. It’s not a bad cough, not like a cold. More of a… tickle in my throat, really. I usually have a glass of water and it goes away. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. I haven’t been sick, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, not that I'm aware of. My mother had high blood pressure, if that matters. But I've never been told I have anything wrong with my heart. I see Dr. Ramirez for my general checkups, and he’s never said a word about it. I've always been fairly healthy, considering my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Considering your age" is an interesting way to put it. Do you know what medications your mother was taking for her blood pressure?
PATIENT: I... I don't recall the specific names, Doctor. It was many years ago. She saw a different doctor, of course. Something… a water pill, I think she mentioned, and another one… a small white pill, maybe? I wasn’t very involved in her medical care, I'm afraid. I kept to myself mostly. She lived a good long life, though. That’s what matters.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I haven't taken many medications in my life, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that's all. I prefer to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: A sensible approach. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart. Please sit up, and I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Then, I'm going to check your ankles for swelling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Proceed whenever you are ready. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Though I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale… again… good. A little bit of wheezing on both sides, but nothing alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Yes, there is some pitting edema in both ankles. Not severe, but definitely present. And your weight, according to the chart, is 68 kilograms. Have you noticed any significant weight gain recently?
PATIENT: A kilogram? I…I don’t measure myself in kilograms, Doctor. I weigh around 150 pounds, give or take a few. And no, I haven't gained any weight, not intentionally. Perhaps a little over the holidays, but nothing drastic. I eat a sensible diet. Mostly. It's the bread I struggle with sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Vanderwiele, based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing early signs of congestive heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying flat, the swelling in your ankles, and the wheezing in your lungs are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, we need to confirm this with further testing. I'm going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray. We will also need to do some blood work, including a BNP level. Do you have any questions so far?
