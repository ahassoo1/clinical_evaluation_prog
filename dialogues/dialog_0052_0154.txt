DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh... good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's... the waterworks. Again. They bother me. A lot. I... I don't recall exactly when it started, but it's been happening... on and off. For a while now, I suppose. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wease. When you say "the waterworks," could you describe what's happening specifically?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Well, I need to… go. A lot. Even when I don’t drink much. And it… burns. When I go. It's a… stinging. A burning feeling. It’s… hard to explain. I just know it’s not comfortable. I… I don’t remember if it hurts before or after. Just that it hurts somehow. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Wease. It sounds quite uncomfortable. So, you're experiencing frequent urination and a burning sensation when you urinate. Has there been any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I haven't… really looked. I just… feel the burning. And I try to get it over with quickly, you see. It’s… embarrassing. I don’t usually… examine things. Is it… common to see blood? I… I don’t want to worry, but…
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you wouldn't want to worry, Ms. Wease, and it's perfectly alright that you haven't specifically looked. Blood in the urine can occur with several conditions, and it doesn’t automatically mean something serious. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination and burning?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms. Let me see… I… I feel tired. Always a bit tired, really. But that’s just… getting older, I suppose. And… sometimes my back aches. Not a bad ache, just… a dull feeling. And… oh, I’m not very hungry these days. I… I don’t know if that’s related. Everything tastes… a bit bland. I… I hope that’s helpful. It’s hard to remember… everything.
DOCTOR: This is very helpful, Ms. Wease. So, you're experiencing fatigue, a dull backache, and a decreased appetite, in addition to the frequent urination and burning sensation. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question. I… I had something… a long time ago. When I was… younger. With the waterworks, yes. The doctor gave me… pills. Pink pills, I think. And it went away. But I don't remember what it was. And… I think my husband mentioned something about my kidneys, but… that was years ago. He worried about everything. I... I honestly can’t recall. I’ve had so many doctors over the years. It all… blurs together. Is it important to know?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know as much as possible, Ms. Wease, but it's completely understandable that it’s difficult to recall details from the past. The previous urinary issue and your husband’s mention of your kidneys are both relevant. Do you recall approximately when you took those pink pills?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That was… after the divorce, I think. Yes. After I moved to… this town. So… must have been… twenty years ago? Maybe more. Time… it just… slips away. I… I don’t remember seeing that doctor again. And I didn't tell anyone about it, really. It was… embarrassing. I just wanted it to go away. I… I really don’t have good memories of that time. Can we… move on? It’s… upsetting to think about.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. We can certainly move on. I apologize for bringing up unpleasant memories. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney disease, diabetes, or bladder problems?
PATIENT: Oh. Family… hmm. My mother… she had… something with her stomach. A lot of pain, I remember. And my brother… he drank a lot. He didn’t take care of himself. I… I don’t think they had anything with their… waterworks. No, I don’t recall. They didn’t talk much about… health things. It was… a different time. Can we… finish soon? I have an appointment… later. It’s… I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I understand you have another appointment. Just a few more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh. No. No medications. Not at all. I… I try to avoid them if I can. I… I take a little vitamin D in the winter, because the doctor said my bones were… weak. But that’s it. Really. Nothing else. I… I prefer to just… tough things out. Is that… alright? I… I don’t want to become dependent on pills. It’s… a bad habit, I think. Can we… stop now? I feel… a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wease. Thank you for your patience and for answering my questions so thoughtfully. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s agreeable to you. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your abdomen, and a simple urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam…? Well… I suppose so. If it’s… necessary. But please… be gentle. I… I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… could someone explain everything before they do it? I… I get nervous easily. And… please don't take too long. I really must… get going soon. Is it… alright if someone else does the… poking? I… I don't think I can explain it properly, but I'd prefer… someone else. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. That is perfectly alright. I will explain everything clearly before we proceed, and I will be as gentle as possible. And yes, absolutely, one of our nurses will be assisting me with the examination. She is very experienced and will ensure your comfort. Nurse Davies, could you please come in and assist us?
