DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel, so nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Osterholm. Now, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I feel… a little worn out. Not sick, exactly, but like I need a… a reset, perhaps? A jumpstart to get my energy back. I’ve been feeling this way for a few months now, and it’s starting to affect things.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Worn out” for a few months… affecting things, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, affecting things. It's… harder to keep up with my work, you see. I mold and shape things – mostly ceramics, though I do some work with other materials. It requires a lot of… precision, and stamina. And lately, I’ve been making more mistakes, and needing longer breaks. It’s also harder to enjoy my time with my husband. I feel… less present, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Ceramics… stamina, precision… alright. And you've noticed this affecting your… enjoyment of things, too. Okay. Let's try to narrow this down. When did you first start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden. Perhaps around… February, maybe? Around the time the weather started to turn a little warmer. It was gradual, so it’s hard to pinpoint an exact date. I initially thought it was just the change in seasons, but it hasn't improved. Does that help?
DOCTOR: February… alright. So, several months now. And have you had any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider… I haven’t been sleeping as well, perhaps? Not tossing and turning all night, just… not as deeply, I suppose. And I think my appetite has been a little smaller. Not drastically, but I don't feel as hungry as I used to. I haven't been sick, though – no colds, no flu, nothing like that. Just… less energy and less appetite. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, less sleep, decreased appetite… No recent illnesses. Are you experiencing any… unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I haven't tried to lose weight, that’s for sure. I… I suppose I have lost a little, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. My clothes feel a bit looser, maybe? It's not a dramatic change, but noticeable if I think about it. I haven’t been paying close attention, to be honest. Is that something I should be paying closer attention to?
DOCTOR: Well, any unexplained weight loss is something to take note of, yes. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I've been quite fortunate, health-wise, for the most part. I have mild high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. My regular doctor monitors it, and I take everything as prescribed. Aside from that… nothing significant. No major surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothing like that. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, as you’d expect.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication… alright, that's good to know. And what medications are you currently taking, specifically?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s not regular. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else, I assure you. I try to avoid taking unnecessary medications. I keep a list at home, if you’d like me to bring it in next time?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… occasional ibuprofen. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat most everything. I’ve always been a fairly adventurous eater, to be honest. My husband jokes that I’ll try anything once. I don't have any known environmental allergies either – no hay fever, no pollen sensitivities. I think I'm pretty fortunate in that regard, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s briefly touch on family history. Any significant medical conditions run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father… he had heart problems. Nothing specific, just general heart issues. My older brother is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. I suppose there’s a bit of a family history of those two things, if that’s helpful? Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: Diabetes, heart problems… alright. And finally, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband used to smoke, but he quit about twenty years ago. We both try to live a healthy lifestyle, within reason. We enjoy walking, and I try to eat a balanced diet. We don't drink very much either, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That's about it, really. A fairly quiet life, mostly focused on my work and spending time with my husband.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Pitzel, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I understand it's necessary. I've had physical exams before, so I know what to expect. I’ll do my best to be still and cooperate. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 132 over 78. Not bad, considering. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Alright. Everything seems… normal, so far. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood work seems like a good next step. I trust your judgement. Just let me know where I need to go to get it done, and if there’s anything I need to do to prepare. I'm happy to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: Alright. You can have that done at the lab just across the street. Nothing special to prepare for, just no fasting is required. It should take about thirty minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect. Across the street is very convenient. I’ll go this afternoon, then. A follow-up appointment to discuss the results sounds good. I’ll just call the office to schedule something once I know when they'll be available. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see what the bloodwork shows. Don’t hesitate to call if anything drastically changes before then. Otherwise, I’ll see you for a follow-up. .
