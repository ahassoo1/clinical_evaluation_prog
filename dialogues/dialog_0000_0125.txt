DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Batara. Look, I just... I wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. Just to be sure, really. My wife and I… we’re careful, but you hear stories, don't you? Best to be safe.
DOCTOR: “The thing,” right. Of course. It’s… prudent to be cautious. Though, frankly, I find people overreact to everything these days. Still. Let’s get some details, shall we?
PATIENT: Details? What kind of details? I mean, I haven’t… had anything happen. It’s just a check-up, preventative, like getting your oil changed. You don't need the whole life story for an oil change, do you?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, comparing a preventative health screening to an automotive service is… a rather simplistic analogy. It’s not about what happened, it’s about risk factors. Have you had any… intimate contact with anyone other than your wife?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh. Are you… implying something? Look, I came here voluntarily, okay? I'm married. A perfectly respectable marriage, thank you very much. I don’t appreciate being… interrogated. It’s a bit rude, isn’t it? What kind of a clinic is this?
DOCTOR: Rude?
PATIENT: It is rude! I'm here because I'm responsible, taking precautions, and now you're suggesting… things. Honestly, I expected a bit more professionalism. And frankly, a little less… judgment. I have Medicare, not a scarlet letter!
DOCTOR: Medicare has nothing to do with it, Mr. Belan. It’s about gathering a complete medical history. It's standard procedure. Now, are you going to answer a simple question, or do you intend to waste my time and yours with… indignation?
PATIENT: Look, I'll answer your questions. Fine. But I’m telling you right now, the answer is going to be no. No other partners. Ever. Happy now? It's a perfectly normal life, a normal marriage. I just want the test, and I want to get this over with. This is… unnecessarily complicated.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on then. Have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Are you serious? Needles? What do you think I am, some sort of… addict? I'm a Compliance Officer! I ensure people follow the rules! I wouldn't even touch a needle unless it was pre-packaged and sterile, and given to me by a qualified professional! This is getting absurd. Really.
DOCTOR: It's a question, Mr. Belan. A standard one. Now, have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? No! Never! Why are you asking me all these… extreme questions? It's like you're building a case against me! I came here for a routine test, not a criminal investigation. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming at all. This is a complete waste of time. I think I'd rather just… leave.
DOCTOR: And abandon a perfectly sensible preventative measure because your feelings are… bruised?
PATIENT: Bruised? You’re the one making assumptions and asking ridiculous questions! It's you who are being unreasonable! I’m a responsible adult, I came here voluntarily, and now I’m being treated like… like a suspect! No, thank you. I think I'll take my business elsewhere. I'm wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Suit yourself, Mr. Belan. Though I must say, I find your reaction… rather telling. Perhaps you should consider why you’re so averse to answering simple medical questions. It’s often more revealing than the answers themselves. .
