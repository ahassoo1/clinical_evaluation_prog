DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Um… well, it’s about some swelling, actually. I’ve noticed it recently, and I thought it best to get it checked out. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when I first noticed it… it feels like a little while now, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, swelling. And you said it's been going on for a little while... that's okay. It can be difficult to pinpoint exact dates. Can you tell me where specifically you've noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly around my jaw, I think. And perhaps a little on my cheeks. It's not terribly noticeable, but I can definitely feel it, especially in the mornings. It’s a bit…soft, if that makes sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. "Soft" is a good description, actually. And mornings being worse is helpful information. Has the swelling been changing at all?
PATIENT: Changing… hmm. I suppose it feels a little more pronounced after I eat, sometimes. Not always, but often. And perhaps a little less noticeable if I’ve been resting. It's hard to say for sure, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’m not entirely certain I’ve been paying close enough attention to how much it changes. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, swelling around the jaw and cheeks, somewhat worse in the mornings and after eating. That gives us a starting point. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No pain, thankfully. And… no fever, I don't believe so. Oh! Sometimes my mouth feels a little dry, but I thought that was just from the weather. Is that… relevant? I really don’t recall anything else significant. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Jahaad. We'll get there. Dry mouth can be relevant. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. And no surgeries, no. I haven’t really been a patient much over the years, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. As for ongoing conditions… I don't have any that I'm aware of. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother is still living, she’s quite healthy, thankfully. My father passed away a few years ago. He… he had some heart problems, I believe. Nothing that was directly inherited, as far as I know. My sister is also healthy, as far as I’m aware. We don't talk very often, unfortunately. I don't… I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. It wasn’t something we discussed often. I apologize again for my lack of information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jahaad. These things aren’t always easy to recall. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I’m aware. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with medications. I haven't taken many, thankfully. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to some strong perfumes, but that's not really an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a headache sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, that wouldn't be considered an allergy. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy and avoid taking anything if I can. Just vitamins occasionally, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Jahaad, I think it’s time to take a look at your jaw and cheeks. Would you mind if I did a quick physical examination?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay… There is some mild swelling along your jawline, as you described. It's soft to the touch, not particularly tender. Skin looks normal, no obvious redness or warmth. I don't feel any distinct masses. Your mouth looks healthy as well. The salivary glands don’t seem enlarged. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it doesn't seem to be anything acutely concerning. I’m thinking it could be related to a mild inflammation, possibly of the salivary glands, but we’ll need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. I was rather worried it might be something serious. What sort of “further testing” would you recommend? And what are the “other possibilities” we need to rule out? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I prefer to be informed, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: No questions at all, Jahaad. It’s good to be informed. As for further testing, I think a blood test would be a good starting point. It can help us rule out any infections or underlying inflammatory conditions. We can also check your salivary gland function. As for other possibilities… sometimes swelling like this can be related to dental issues, although it doesn’t sound like that’s the case here. In rare instances, it could be related to something more serious, but those are less common, and we'll investigate those only if the initial tests suggest it. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a salivary gland function test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A blood test and a salivary gland function test seem sensible. I’m happy to proceed with whatever you think is necessary. When can I expect the results? And will I need to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back to us. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. Yes, I’d like you to come back in a week to discuss the results and determine the next steps. If you experience any sudden pain, fever, or difficulty swallowing in the meantime, please contact the clinic immediately. Would you like me to schedule that appointment now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Scheduling it now would be wonderful. A week from today sounds fine. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It really puts my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's see... how about next Tuesday at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Perhaps any paperwork? Or specific instructions for the blood test?
DOCTOR: Here's the requisition form for the blood test. It has the specific instructions – it's a standard test, but it's always good to have the details. You don't need to fast beforehand, but please drink plenty of water before the test. And no, no other paperwork is necessary. The nurse will give you a quick overview of aftercare. I'll see you next Tuesday. If anything changes before then, don't hesitate to call. .
PATIENT: Thank you again for your kindness and expertise, Doctor. I certainly will. Have a wonderful day.
