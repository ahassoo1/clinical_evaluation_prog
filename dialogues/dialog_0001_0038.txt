DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s…rather difficult to explain precisely. I believe I require some paperwork concerning…future medical choices. Something to ensure my wishes are known, should I…become unable to express them myself. I was told this clinic could assist me with an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m…vaguely familiar with the terms, but honestly, I’m not entirely certain which is appropriate.
DOCTOR: Paperwork, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It’s…a bit embarrassing, really. My ex-husband was quite insistent I get something in order, and now…well, now I find myself wishing I’d done so sooner. It’s just…a lot to consider, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize if I’m being unclear. Perhaps you could explain the difference between those forms—the Advance Directive and the POLST—and we could determine which is best suited for my situation? I'm not sure where to begin.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Buoniconti, people come in here with real medical problems. But fine. Advance Directive is…broad. It covers a lot. POLST is more for when you’re already sick, telling us what not to do. You want paperwork because your ex-husband said so?
PATIENT: It’s…more complicated than simply his suggestion, Doctor. He was…involved in my care, previously. A long story. And I…I do want to ensure my wishes are respected. It’s not merely about fulfilling his request, though I understand it sounds that way. If an Advance Directive covers a broader range of scenarios, perhaps that is the better option. Could you explain what sort of decisions it typically addresses? And…what would be involved in completing one? I worry about being…detailed enough, given my…difficulties with recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. It’s basically a document saying who makes decisions for you if you can't. And what decisions they can make. Things like…life support, feeding tubes, that sort of thing. It’s a lot of legal jargon. We have a template. You fill it out, sign it, get a witness. It’s really not that complicated. You worried about remembering?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. It’s…frustrating. I recall events as…fragments. Like looking through frosted glass. So, to be clear, this template…it prompts me with specific scenarios? It doesn't require me to anticipate every possible situation? I’m afraid of omitting something vital. And…who would serve as a witness? Does it need to be a medical professional? Perhaps a lawyer? I apologize for the questions; I simply want to ensure this is done correctly.
DOCTOR: Look, it asks you what you generally want. It’s not a test. Witness just needs to be…an adult. Not involved in your care. Doesn’t need a law degree. Honestly, Ms. Buoniconti, people make this way harder than it needs to be. I can pull up the form. We can go through it together. But I have other patients waiting, so let’s try to be…efficient.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. “Efficient” is a good goal, certainly. I’m quite capable, when not…distracted. And yes, if you could guide me through it, that would be immensely helpful. Perhaps we could start with the section regarding life support? That seems…the most pressing, considering my…concerns.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Life Support.” It asks if you want mechanical ventilation, CPR…that kind of thing. Do you want everything done to keep you alive, no matter what?
PATIENT: That…is a difficult question. “Everything,” perhaps, is…too absolute. I believe…quality of life is important. If there is no reasonable hope of recovery, and…it would simply prolong suffering…then, no. I would not wish to be kept alive artificially. Though…defining “reasonable hope” feels subjective. Is there a way to specify…the severity of the condition? Or…the likelihood of regaining a meaningful quality of life? I apologize; I’m likely rambling.
DOCTOR: See?
PATIENT: Oh. I…apologies. It's…easy to become lost in the details, and I seem to be doing that again. “Do Not Attempt Resuscitation”...that's what the checkbox implies, is it not? And…it applies only if I am deemed…unable to recover meaningfully? Perhaps a brief explanation of the scenarios this applies to would be helpful. For my…clarity.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s for if your heart stops, you stop breathing. Basically, you’re telling us not to shock you back to life if you're…well, basically, gone. Now, feeding tubes. Do you want a tube if you can't eat on your own?
PATIENT: That clarifies it. I…understand now. “Not to shock me back to life.” It sounds…rather stark, but it is…reasonable. And I suppose, if there is no possibility of regaining the ability to eat independently, a feeding tube…would be acceptable. Though…I recall a previous medical issue where…there was a risk of aspiration. Would it be possible to specify a preference for oral nutrition whenever feasible? Even if it requires assistance? I apologize again for the numerous questions. I simply wish to ensure my wishes are meticulously documented.
DOCTOR: Meticulously documented, huh?
PATIENT: It…sounds excessive, doesn’t it? Perhaps I’m overly cautious. It's just…I've had…unpleasant experiences with miscommunication in the past. A simple preference for oral nutrition, whenever possible, feels…important. It’s a matter of dignity, I suppose. If that is not possible to include, I understand. I do not wish to unduly burden you.
DOCTOR: Fine. I added “attempt oral nutrition first.” Happy now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. That…is perfectly adequate. Immensely so, in fact. I appreciate your patience and willingness to accommodate my…requests. It's…a great weight off my mind. Now, if you are agreeable, perhaps we could move on to the section regarding pain management? I confess, that is another area where my memory is…particularly fragmented.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pain management. It just asks what level of pain you're comfortable with. Do you want to be kept pain-free no matter what?
PATIENT: “No matter what…” That is…a difficult concept. While I would certainly wish to minimize discomfort, I also…recall reading that complete elimination of pain can sometimes…hinder the healing process. And…it can mask other, more serious symptoms. Would it be possible to specify a preference for…aggressive pain management, but with regular assessments to ensure I am still aware of my surroundings and can communicate effectively? I apologize; I seem to be trapped in a cycle of caveats. It’s simply…a great responsibility, articulating these wishes.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Buoniconti, you're going to overthink yourself into an early grave. We’re talking about pain medication. Do you want it, or don't you?
PATIENT: You…are quite right, Doctor. I am overthinking it. It’s a…habit. And I…do want it, yes. I want to be comfortable. And I trust your judgment regarding the appropriate level of medication. Perhaps…perhaps it would be best if I simply initial the relevant sections, allowing you to exercise your professional discretion? I clearly lack the…nuance to articulate these preferences effectively.
DOCTOR: Fine. Initial away. I've got patients waiting, Ms. Buoniconti. Just sign the bottom. And try not to question every single thing.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Here you are. Is there anything else I need to do? Or is this sufficient? I sincerely appreciate your assistance, despite my…numerous inquiries.
DOCTOR: That’ll do. I’ll make a copy for your records. Now, if you don’t have any real medical problems, I suggest you have a good day. Anything else, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. I sincerely appreciate your patience and willingness to accommodate my…concerns. And thank you for the copy of the form. I believe I can manage from here. Have a good day as well, Doctor Pehrson. Though…just one final, rather trivial question, if I may? Do you happen to know what day it is? My memory…is proving rather unreliable. .
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Now please, have a good day. .
