DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Well… it’s… down there. It’s… icky. Something’s coming out. Not supposed to, ya know? It’s been a few days now. I don't really… keep track of dates. But a few. It's kinda embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "icky" and something coming out… not supposed to. A few days. I understand it's embarrassing, no need to worry about that. Just try to tell me as much as you can. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? Not really painful. More… uncomfortable. Like somethin's just… not right. Itches sometimes. Mostly just… wet. And smells a little funny. Not like flowers, that's for sure. I keep tryin’ to clean it, but it just keeps comin’ back. I used to just wash with soap, ya know? Is that not good enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable, itchy, wet, and a funny smell… and you've been trying to clean it with soap. Soap can sometimes… disrupt the natural balance down there, which can actually make things worse. It's good you’re trying to keep it clean, though. Now, have you noticed any burning when you use the bathroom?
PATIENT: Burnin’? Hmm… Now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not every time. Just sometimes when I pee. It's not like a fire, but… a little sting. Like when you get soap in your eye, kinda. Does that make sense? I don’t really… pay attention to stuff like that usually.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A stinging sensation when you urinate… okay. And has the amount of discharge changed at all?
PATIENT: Discharge? You mean the… icky stuff? Well, I think so. At first it was just a little. Like after you sweat, ya know? But now… now it’s more. I gotta use a pad, just to be safe. It’s not like a lot, but… enough. It's white, I think. Or kinda yellow. I don't really look at it too close.
DOCTOR: Okay, increasing amount of discharge, white or yellowish, needing a pad… Right. And just to be sure, have you had any fever, or any lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I know of. I haven’t felt hot or nothin’. And my tummy… feels okay. A little achy sometimes, but I'm old! Everything aches sometimes. Could be the weather, ya know? We had a lot of rain last week. Everything gets damp.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Genard, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to take a quick look. Just a simple examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. That kind of look? Ugh. Well… I guess so. Gotta do what ya gotta do, right? But don't take long. And be gentle, okay? I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll just take a look and see what’s going on. Please lie down on the table and put your feet in the stirrups when you’re ready. I’ll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Stirrups? Oh… those things. Haven’t done that in a long time. Okay… here we go. Just… hurry, okay? This is kinda awkward.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax as much as you can. I’m just going to take a look. Okay, I’m seeing some redness and slight swelling. The discharge has a slightly fishy odor. No obvious lesions. It does appear to be some inflammation. Just going to take a quick swab here. You might feel a slight pressure. Alright, all done. We'll send this sample to the lab for testing. It should give us a clearer idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Fishy? Ugh, that's not good. I haven't been eating fish lately! Ooh, that tickles. And it’s kinda cold. So… what does this mean? Is it bad? I don’t want somethin’ serious. Old ladies get everything, ya know.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t mean you’ve been eating fish! It’s just a way to describe the smell of the discharge. It often indicates an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina, which is quite common. We'll know for sure once the lab results come back, but it's most likely a case of bacterial vaginosis, or BV. It’s usually not serious, and easily treated with antibiotics. It’s more common as we get older due to changes in hormone levels. We’ll get you taken care of, don’t you worry. Now, let me write you a prescription for a course of metronidazole. It's an oral antibiotic. You’ll need to take it twice a day for seven days. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Metronida… what-now? Seven days? Ugh. More pills. I already take so many. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I was itchy once after takin’ somethin’… but I don't remember what it was. It was a long time ago. Maybe penicillin? Or somethin' like that. My niece usually tells me what I can and can't take, but she's busy with her kids. It's all a blur, honestly. I just try to take what the doctors give me.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible allergy to penicillin… that’s good to know. We’ll avoid that. Metronidazole is a different type of antibiotic, so it should be fine, but we'll note the allergy in your records. Here's the prescription for the metronidazole and these instructions explain everything – how to take it, potential side effects, and what to watch out for. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before the seven days are up. It helps prevent the infection from coming back. Also, it's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can cause unpleasant side effects. Do you have any questions about the medication or the instructions?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Ugh, everything's a problem. It’s kinda small print. I need my glasses. But… seven days, no alcohol… Okay. I think I understand. It’s just… a lot to remember. Is there anything else I should know? Like… can I still swim? I like to swim. It's good for my arthritis.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, it is a lot. And that's a good question about swimming. While you're taking the medication, it's best to avoid swimming, or at least avoid getting water inside the vagina. It can disrupt the balance of the medication and make it less effective. Once you've finished the course, you should be fine. We'll also want to follow up with another test in a few weeks to make sure the infection is completely gone. I’ll have the nurse schedule that for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Another test? Ugh. This is never-ending. Well… I guess not. Just… try to make it easy on an old lady, okay? I don't want to keep comin' back here. It's a long drive, ya know. And the waitin' room's always so crowded. I think that's all for now. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll do our best to make it as easy as possible. The nurse will explain everything clearly, and we’ll try to get you in and out quickly for the follow-up. I'm glad I could help. If you have any questions at all after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s the number. Get well soon, Mrs. Genard.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. You too.
