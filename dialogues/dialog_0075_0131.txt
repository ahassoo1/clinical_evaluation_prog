DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Panjoj. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's my blood pressure, really. It's been a bit high lately, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you’re being proactive about it. "A bit high" can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, my sister, she has a machine, a blood pressure cuff. She let me use it a couple times, and both times it was… over 140, I think. Maybe 145 over 90, something like that. It just felt… higher than what I usually see on those shows on TV, you know? I don't really know what's normal, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those numbers are a bit elevated, and it's smart to get it checked out properly. It’s good you have a family member who allows you to use their machine. We’ll get a more accurate reading here. Do you feel any symptoms when your blood pressure is high, like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Not really, no. That's the thing, I don't feel anything different. No headaches, no dizziness... sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I just figured that was from sleeping wrong. Honestly, I wouldn't have even known if my sister hadn't mentioned it. She's real big on health stuff, so she's always checking everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable symptoms besides the occasional neck stiffness. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or has a doctor ever mentioned it to you?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… a first, really. I go to the doctor for my yearly check-ups, you know, Medicare stuff, but they never said anything about my blood pressure being high. Just the usual, weight, cholesterol, things like that. Everything was always “normal,” they said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had something with her heart when she got older. I don't know exactly what it was, just that she had to take pills for it. And my uncle, he had a stroke a few years back, but he smoked, a lot. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts. Both a family history of heart issues and stroke are relevant. Okay, and just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work part-time, mostly helping folks out with cleaning and errands, you know? Nothing too strenuous. I try to walk when I can, but it’s hot outside a lot these days. I eat pretty normally, I guess… I like to cook, but sometimes I grab something quick if I'm tired. I don't really drink or smoke, and I don't have any major bad habits that I can think of. Just a regular life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my joints are acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. That's about it. Nothing regularly, except the vitamin. I try not to take too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. That’s good. Now, let’s get some measurements. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully it's not too bad. I get a little nervous with doctor stuff sometimes, even though I know it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s get started. First, I’m going to put this cuff around your arm… alright, breathe normally. … 148 over 92. And your pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright, everything sounds good so far. Your blood pressure is elevated, as you suspected. We'll need to repeat this reading a couple of times to confirm, and then we can discuss potential causes and next steps. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything before. I can eat anything, take anything... well, mostly anything. I'm pretty lucky like that, I guess. Just don't like the taste of some pills, that's all. Repeating the reading sounds good though. Maybe it was just because I was nervous when I first came in?
DOCTOR: That's possible. Anxiety can definitely raise your blood pressure. Let’s take another reading after a few minutes of rest. Okay, let’s see… 150 over 94. Still elevated, unfortunately. We are consistently seeing high numbers. While a single high reading isn't cause for alarm, repeated elevations like this warrant further investigation. Do you have any pain right now?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just a little worried now, to be honest. I don't like the sound of "further investigation." What does that even mean? Is it something serious? I really don’t want to have to start taking pills every day, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. “Further investigation” simply means we’ll run some tests to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to find out why it’s high so we can manage it properly. Possible causes can range from lifestyle factors - diet, exercise, stress - to underlying medical conditions. We'll start with some blood work and a urine test to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and look for any other potential issues. We may also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay... that sounds a little better, knowing it’s just to find out what’s going on. Blood work and urine test, I can handle that. And an EKG... is that the thing with the stickers on your chest? I think I've seen it on TV. Yes, I'm comfortable with that. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to pick up my nephew from school later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one. It’s quick and painless – just a few stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. Alright, I’ll get the lab orders printed for you. In the meantime, I'm going to ask a few more questions about your diet and exercise habits. Do you add salt to your food?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. Not a lot, but I usually sprinkle a little on my eggs in the morning, and sometimes when I'm cooking dinner. Old habits, you know? My mother always used salt, so I guess I just picked it up from her. Is that bad? I thought a little salt was okay.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being honest about that. For some people, even a small amount of added salt can contribute to high blood pressure. It's something we'll discuss as we go through your test results. We may recommend a low-sodium diet if your blood pressure remains elevated. Do you drink a lot of fluids?
PATIENT: I try to. Usually a couple glasses of water with my meals, and sometimes juice. Not soda, I don’t really drink that. I know you’re supposed to drink a lot of water, so I try to keep up with it. I get thirsty sometimes, especially with the heat, so I drink when I feel thirsty. Is there a specific amount I should be drinking? I never really paid attention to it before.
DOCTOR: That's good. Staying hydrated is important. Most adults should aim for around 8 glasses of water a day, but it depends on your activity level and climate. I’ll give you a handout with some helpful information about diet and lifestyle modifications to help manage your blood pressure. Now, let’s talk about stress. Do you feel stressed often, or have any significant stressors in your life right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… I wouldn't say I'm constantly stressed, but things have been a little hectic lately. My sister’s been sick, so I've been helping out with her kids, and work has been busy. Nothing I can’t handle, but it’s a lot to juggle sometimes. It keeps me busy, though. I don’t really have time to sit around and worry, if you know what I mean. Does that count as stress? I don't really get anxious or anything.
DOCTOR: That definitely counts as stress. Even if you don’t experience anxiety, juggling multiple responsibilities can raise your blood pressure. We’ll discuss some stress-management techniques. Okay, I think that covers the most important questions for now. I'm going to write up a summary of our discussion and the orders for the blood work, urine test and EKG. You can head to the lab after this, and the EKG can be done here in the clinic. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan for managing your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'm a little worried, but I feel better knowing we're going to figure out what's going on. And I'll try to cut back on the salt, and maybe think about ways to relax a little more. I don't want to start taking pills if I don't have to. Thank you, Dr. Panjoj.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. That’s a very proactive attitude, and I commend you for that. Remember, we're a team in this, and we’ll work together to get your blood pressure under control. Here are the lab orders and the handout I mentioned. The lab is just down the hall to your left, and the nurse will get you set up for the EKG when you are finished with the blood work. Please call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you again for everything. I’ll go get the tests done, and then I’ll schedule the follow-up. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
