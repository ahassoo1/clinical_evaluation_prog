DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Ashlie Hembrey. It says here you’re 86 years young. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Eighty-six, yes. Still workin', mind you. Better than sittin’ around doin’ nothin’. They sent me here… somethin’ about the dust at the mine. Ain’t feelin’ nothin’ wrong, though. Never have. Just paperwork, I reckon. They makin’ a fuss over nothin’.
DOCTOR: Paperwork can be…thorough, Mr. Bigger. However, we do take your health seriously, even if you feel perfectly well. This "dust at the mine," as you put it… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What kinda question is that? It’s dust! Coal dust. Been workin’ in them mines since I was a young man. It gets everywhere. Always has. They just started askin’ questions now. Never bothered nobody before. It's black dust, what do you want to know? How much of it there is? I don’t keep track of dust!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. My apologies. It’s simply… prolonged exposure to coal dust can lead to certain respiratory conditions. And now that you're seeing a physician, we need to gather some information. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing at all?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kinda changes? I breathe. Always have. Sometimes it’s a little harder when it’s real hot, or when I been climbin’ stairs, but that’s just bein’ old, ain’t it? Never coughed up nothin’ special. Never had no wheezin’ or nothin’. They makin’ a big deal outta nothin’, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: It’s prudent to be thorough, Mr. Bigger. Even if it is just being old, as you say. Let's move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. I had a bad back once. Pulled somethin’ liftin’ a beam. Took some pills, got better. And my wife… bless her soul… she had the sugar. But that was her, not me. Apart from that, I been pretty lucky, I think. Never been a sickly man.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you currently take any medications, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Just the little blue pills sometimes. For sleepin'. Old age, you know. Can’t sleep without ‘em sometimes. And some ointment for my knees when they bother me. That’s it. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than what we’ve already discussed?
PATIENT: No. Never been in no hospital 'cept when my wife... when she passed. And that weren’t for me, mind you. Just... visitin'. Never needed surgery. Strong as an ox, I was. Still am, mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. Lots of 'em gone now. My mama… she lived a long life. Had a weak heart, I think. My brother… he drank too much. Didn’t take care of himself. Apart from that… nothin’ I can recall. They didn’t go to doctors much back then. Didn't believe in it.
DOCTOR: I see. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated 'em. As for drinkin'... used to have a little beer now and then, with the boys after work. But nothin' serious. Haven't had a drop in years. Too expensive, mostly. And don’t need the trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I understand you feel quite well, and you’ve had a long and, for the most part, healthy life. However, given your extensive history of coal dust exposure, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, primarily focusing on your lungs and heart. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical exam? For what? I just told you I feel fine! What’s the point of pokin’ and proddin’ if I ain’t sick? Waste of time, if you ask me. They sendin’ me here just to fill out paperwork, ain’t it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your skepticism, but it’s standard procedure. A physical exam isn’t necessarily to confirm a sickness, but to establish a baseline and document your current health status. It allows us to monitor for any potential changes in the future, should they arise. And frankly, it’s part of my professional responsibility. It won't take long. I simply need to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen saturation. Would you allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Hmph. Oxygen saturation... sounds complicated. Fine. But make it quick. Don't want to be here all day. And don’t go pokin’ around too much. I ain’t a stuffed animal.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in the lower lobes of both lungs. Not alarming, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, I’m just going to place this clip on your finger… to check your oxygen level. Your oxygen saturation is currently 94%, which is within a normal range. And your heart rate is slightly elevated, but again, not concerning given your age and recent activity level.
PATIENT: Elevated? I walked here! Ain’t been sittin’ around doin’ nothin’ but workin’, I tell ya. What's all this mean anyway? Is somethin’ wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I want to be clear: these findings are not necessarily indicative of a serious problem. However, given your history of coal dust exposure, and these mild findings, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any potential lung damage. It's a precautionary measure. We can schedule that here at the clinic, or I can provide a referral to a radiologist. It's your choice. And to be thorough, I'd also like to order some basic bloodwork to assess your overall health.
PATIENT: Chest X-ray? Bloodwork? Now you’re just tryin’ to find somethin’ wrong! I tell ya, this is a waste of time and money. I feel fine! Why can’t you just leave well enough alone? This is what happens when you go to doctors… they always want to poke and prod and find somethin’ to worry about. I ain't gettin' no X-rays. And I ain't givin' no blood. I came here to get this over with, not to be treated like I’m fallin’ apart!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I respect your decision, but I strongly advise against refusing these tests. While you may feel well, coal dust exposure can have delayed and insidious effects on the lungs. Ignoring potential problems now could lead to more serious complications later. However, I will not force you to undergo any procedures against your will. I will document your refusal in your chart. I recommend you discuss this further with a trusted family member or another physician. Given your concerns and your refusal of further testing, I will complete the necessary paperwork for your employer, stating you underwent a physical examination with mild wheezing detected and no further intervention requested by the patient. Do you understand?
