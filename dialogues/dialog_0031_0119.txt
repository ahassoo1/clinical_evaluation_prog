DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s not something one discusses lightly, you understand. It’s… a problem. A delicate problem, with… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. It’s simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Ms. Wartick. You’ve come to the right place, and I assure you, this is a safe and confidential environment. Many patients experience similar concerns. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it’s coming from… down there. From him. Yes, my… companion. It's not a pleasant sight, Doctor. Frankly, I suspect he hasn’t been taking proper care of himself. It’s rather… milky, I suppose. And there’s a… a bit of an odor. Not his usual scent, certainly. I've been trying to tell him about hygiene, honestly, but men… they simply don't listen.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wartick. It sounds… concerning. Just to clarify, are you saying the discharge is coming from your partner?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no! Not me! I am a respectable woman! It’s… it's his problem. He’s the one with the… affliction. I simply noticed it when… well, never mind the details. It’s just… very unhygienic, Doctor. And frankly, rather worrisome. I mean, what if it’s… catching?
DOCTOR: I see. My apologies for the misunderstanding, Ms. Wartick. You are saying your partner is experiencing a discharge. To get a better understanding of what’s happening, could you tell me how long you’ve noticed this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… well, a few weeks, I suppose. Not that he admits it. He’s terribly stubborn, you see. Keeps saying it’s “nothing.” Men and their pride! Honestly, it's gotten worse recently. More noticeable. And the… smell is becoming quite pungent. I had to open a window last night! It’s simply ruining my sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks, and it’s been worsening recently with a noticeable odor. Has he experienced any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes. He’s been rather… irritable. Complaining about a burning sensation, he says. And… and a bit of discomfort. Down there, naturally. He’s also been visiting the… facilities more frequently, if you understand my meaning. It’s all very unsettling, Doctor. I suspect it's something… dreadful. Really dreadful. He won’t see a doctor himself, of course. Too proud. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay. So irritability, a burning sensation, increased frequency of urination… all occurring alongside the discharge. Has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… he did mention feeling a bit warm the other night. Said he was just “a little under the weather.” He wouldn’t elaborate, of course. And… perhaps a slight discomfort in his lower abdomen. But he attributed it to indigestion! Honestly, the man is impossible. He refuses to acknowledge anything serious is wrong. He just says he's “fine.” But I know better, Doctor. I always know better. He has been avoiding a certain… activity as well. I think it hurts him.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like your partner may be experiencing symptoms consistent with a possible infection, such as urethritis or prostatitis. However, to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment, a medical examination and some tests are necessary. Would you be comfortable if I conducted a physical exam to assess the situation?
PATIENT: An examination? Me? Doctor, are you suggesting I be examined? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. It is him who is unwell! And frankly, the thought of anyone poking around… well, it’s simply out of the question! I came here to describe his problem, not to be subjected to… indignities! Is it not possible to simply prescribe something based on my description? Surely, you’ve seen this before? This is clearly an infection of his making, and a simple antibiotic should suffice. I haven't got all day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick, and I apologize if I caused any confusion. I certainly wouldn’t suggest examining you. My intention was to gather information to best understand your partner’s condition. However, to properly diagnose and treat his symptoms, he would need to be examined. Unfortunately, I cannot prescribe medication without a proper assessment. As you mentioned, it's important to determine the cause of the infection before starting any treatment. Given that he's reluctant to seek medical attention, perhaps we can discuss ways to encourage him to see a doctor?
PATIENT: Encourage him? Doctor, you clearly don’t understand men. It’s like talking to a brick wall! He’s terribly proud and insists he’s “fine.” He’ll just dismiss it, tell me it’s nothing, and continue… well, continuing to be a nuisance! Honestly, the whole situation is utterly exasperating! Is there absolutely nothing you can do without him being present? Perhaps a strong antibiotic, just in case? Something broad-spectrum? I really cannot deal with this for much longer. The odor is becoming unbearable, and I fear it may be affecting my social life! I have a luncheon with the ladies next week, and I simply cannot risk… exposure.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your frustration and your concerns about your luncheon. However, prescribing antibiotics without a proper diagnosis is not ethically sound and can be harmful. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance and may not effectively treat the underlying cause of his symptoms. It’s important to identify the specific infection to ensure the most appropriate treatment. I strongly recommend encouraging him to see a physician. If he absolutely refuses, perhaps a visit to an urgent care clinic would be more acceptable?
PATIENT: Urgent care? Honestly, Doctor, you expect me to drag him to urgent care? The indignity! He’d never forgive me. No, it's simply out of the question. Fine. I understand. You won't prescribe anything without seeing him. Well, then, what can you do? Perhaps some… preventative measures? Something for me? To counteract the… effects? Some sort of air freshener recommendation? Or perhaps a very strong perfume? It’s simply dreadful, Doctor. Utterly dreadful. I feel helpless, and I fear my reputation is at stake!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick, and I apologize that I cannot offer a more immediate solution. While I cannot prescribe medication without examining your partner, I can offer some suggestions to manage the situation. Regarding the odor, ensuring good ventilation in your home is important. Opening windows and using an air purifier can help. As for products, a strong perfume may mask the odor temporarily, but it won’t address the underlying issue. I can also provide you with educational resources about common urological infections and their symptoms. Perhaps having more information will help you encourage your partner to seek medical attention. Would you like me to print out some information for you?
PATIENT: Educational resources? Honestly, Doctor, I am a woman of a certain… standing. I hardly need a pamphlet explaining… that. And a perfume recommendation is hardly a solution to this… predicament. Very well. If you absolutely cannot help me without seeing him, then I suppose I have no choice but to… endure. But I must say, I am deeply disappointed. I came here seeking a swift resolution, and all I’ve received is… lectures and pamphlets. Perhaps… a referral? Do you know any… discreet doctors? Someone who might be willing to… expedite the process? Someone who understands the… sensitivities of the situation? It’s really all I ask. And perhaps a strong perfume recommendation, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand your disappointment, Ms. Wartick. I am happy to provide you with a referral to a urologist in the area. Dr. Eleanor Vance is highly respected and known for her discretion and thoroughness. I will also include her contact information and a brief note explaining your situation. Here is the referral information. As for a perfume recommendation, Chanel No. 5 is a classic choice with a strong, lasting scent. I truly wish I could offer a more direct solution, Ms. Wartick. But ultimately, your partner’s health and well-being are the priority. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
