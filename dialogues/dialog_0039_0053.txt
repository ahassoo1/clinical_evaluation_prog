DOCTOR: Hello Kandy, welcome! It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble… going. It takes a long time, and sometimes it just… doesn’t come out easily, you know? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with urination… taking a long time, and sometimes difficult to start or incomplete emptying. About a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It’s not painful, exactly, just… frustrating. And I find myself going more often, even when I don’t really need to. Does that make sense? I don’t want to be a bother, but it’s starting to worry me a bit. It’s just not like me.
DOCTOR: No, it makes perfect sense, Kandy. You're not a bother at all, that’s what I’m here for. Frequent and difficult urination… we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The color… no, I don’t think so. It looks pretty much the same as always, I suppose. A normal yellow, maybe a little darker sometimes if I haven’t had enough to drink, but that’s just me being forgetful and not drinking enough water, usually. As for smell… honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to the smell. It smells like… pee, you know? Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kandy. You’re being very helpful! It's good you've noticed if the color changes with your hydration. And no, "smells like pee" is helpful – we’re just ruling things out. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no pain, not really. Like I said, it’s not painful. Sometimes, just a little discomfort after I finally manage to go, but it goes away quickly. It feels… empty, almost, like I haven’t quite finished, even when I think I have. Does that sound silly? I don't want to bother you with all these little details...
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound silly at all, Kandy. Incomplete emptying is a very important detail. It’s good you’re telling me everything, even the small things. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the doctor told me years ago I had… a little bit of high blood pressure, but he put me on a pill for it. I took it for a while, but then I switched doctors and the new one said it was okay to stop, as long as I watched my salt intake. And I do! Mostly. Medicare pays for regular check-ups, so I get it looked at now and then. Apart from that… nothing major, I don’t think. I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, but that was ages ago, and I haven't had any trouble with that since.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of hypertension, managed with diet now, and gallbladder removal. Let me just confirm – the gallbladder removal, roughly when was that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must have been… oh, thirty years ago, at least. Maybe even longer. It was before I moved to this city, that’s for sure. I was much younger then! It was a simple operation, nothing to worry about. I remember being in the hospital for a few days, but it wasn't too bad. The doctor was very nice. I can't recall his name now, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kandy. Thirty years ago is a long time. No need to worry about the doctor's name. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – anyone with kidney problems, bladder issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Let me see. My mother… she had some sort of trouble with her kidneys when she was older, I think. She was always tired and had to go to the hospital sometimes. But I don’t remember the specifics. And my brother, he had diabetes, but he lived far away and we didn't see each other very often. He passed away a few years ago. Apart from that… not that I can recall, no. We weren't a very talkative family, if you know what I mean. Everyone kept to themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of kidney problems in your mother, and diabetes in your brother. Okay, and finally, before we move on, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood pressure pill you used to take?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, the doctor gave me something for my arthritis in my hands, it's a little white pill, I take it every morning. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, I take an extra one. I think it’s called… naproxen? Yes, that's it, naproxen. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. And… oh, that's it, I think. I don't take many pills, really. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so naproxen for arthritis as needed, and vitamin D supplement daily. Thank you, Kandy, that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a listen to your abdomen, and a quick check of your reflexes, things like that. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. I have a little appointment later this afternoon with my niece, and I don't want to be late. She's been wanting to show me her new garden.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kandy. I’ll be as quick as I can. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Could you please lie back on the exam table?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. There we go. Is there anything special I need to do? Should I breathe a certain way? I always get nervous at the doctor’s office. It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: No, nothing special at all. Just relax and breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out… that’s good. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t hear any abnormal sounds. A little tenderness when I press here, on your lower left side, but nothing alarming. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs... Could you just dangle your legs over the side of the table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. I’m not very flexible these days, you know. My arthritis… it makes everything a bit stiff. Do you need me to do anything special with my legs? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Kandy. Just relax. I’m just checking your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon with age and arthritis. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, one quick check of your lower back… Could you lean forward just a little for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. There we go. My back isn't as good as it used to be. I used to be very active, you know. I loved to dance. But now… it’s a bit difficult to bend over. Is there anything in particular you’re looking for? I hope it's not anything serious. My niece is taking me to see her new garden later, and I don't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: No, just checking for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Everything feels normal there. Okay, Kandy, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with overactive bladder, possibly with some incomplete emptying. Your diminished reflexes could contribute to that. We can't be certain without a few tests, though. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a bladder scan to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine analysis and… a bladder scan, you said? Is that painful? I don’t like needles, you know. And I don't want to be a bother, but it's just… I want to get to the bottom of this. I have a feeling it’s more than just getting old. It's just… unsettling, you know? And my niece… she worries about me. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: No, the bladder scan is not painful at all. It’s completely non-invasive. It uses sound waves, like an ultrasound, to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. No needles involved, I promise. And you’re not a bother, Kandy, we're working together to figure this out. We can do the urine analysis right here in the office. The bladder scan can be done by the technician down the hall, it should only take a few minutes. Then, we’ll review the results and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds much better, Doctor. No needles, you say? That’s a relief. Yes, let’s do the urine analysis now, and then the scan with the technician. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? It’s silly, getting old, but it’s unsettling to have things not work like they used to. And my niece… she's very worried. I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily. What’s the technician’s name? Is she nice? I hope it doesn't take too long, because I promised my niece I'd be there by three.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. And you're not silly at all, Kandy. It’s perfectly normal to want things to work as they should. The technician's name is Maria, and she's wonderful. Very gentle and kind. It shouldn't take too long, I’ll let her know you have an appointment by three. Okay, let's get a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and some instructions. Do you need assistance getting to the restroom?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I can manage, thank you. I’ve done this before, unfortunately. Just let me know if there’s anything special I need to do. Sometimes my hands are a little shaky, so it can be tricky. But I’ll manage, I’m sure. Just… let me know if you need me to come back. It's just… I get a little flustered sometimes. It's silly, getting old, but it’s unsettling. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Kandy. And don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. I'll be right here.
