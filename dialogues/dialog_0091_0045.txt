DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Pleasure to meet you too. It’s this… flushing. It happens on my face, and sometimes my neck. It’s been going on for a little bit now. Not sure why it happens, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: I see. Flushing, you say. And it affects your face and sometimes your neck. And you're unsure of what might be causing it. Could you tell me a little more about when this flushing occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it happens. Let me think. It doesn’t seem to be after exercise, I haven’t been doing much of that lately. And not after eating anything special, I don't think. Sometimes it just… comes. Like, I’m sitting, watching the news, and then… warm. Red. It’s very strange. It doesn’t hurt, though. Just… embarrassing. It lasts maybe five minutes? Sometimes less.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to occur spontaneously, even when at rest, and isn’t related to specific foods or activity. It's not painful, just… noticeable and lasts for a few minutes. And you said it’s been happening for “a little bit now” – could you estimate how long?
PATIENT: Let me see… I reckon about three weeks, maybe four. It started slow, just a little bit of color, thought it was the sun. But now it’s… more. Happened three times last week, I think. It’s hard to keep track, you know? I mostly stay home. Not many people see it. But it is worrying me a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. Three to four weeks, and increasing in frequency, with about three episodes last week. That is concerning enough to investigate. Before we proceed, let's gather a more comprehensive history. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, even if it’s not consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers. That's a good question. Nothing I can put my finger on. I did have a bit of a stressful phone call with my niece last week, about… money, actually. It happened before one of the flushes, but I get stressful calls all the time. Not always this happens, though. And… I started a new tea, maybe a month ago. Something with ginger and lemon? I can’t recall the name, now. I like the taste, though. Very soothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a stressful phone call around the time of one episode, and you’ve started a new ginger and lemon tea about a month ago. We'll certainly consider both of those. Now, let’s move on to your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I was pretty healthy, always have been. A little bit of arthritis in my knees, the doctor said, but nothing serious. Just gets stiff sometimes. Otherwise… good. I used to walk a lot, before my wife… well, never mind. But I have no big illnesses. No pills, no nothing. Just the arthritis cream when it bothers me.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you have some arthritis in your knees, managed with topical cream, but otherwise consider yourself to be in good health, with no other diagnosed medical conditions and no regular medications. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never needed them. I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing cricket, but it healed fine. No hospital stays, except when my wife… oh, it was many years ago. Just that. No other times. Nothing serious, like you asked.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries or significant hospitalizations. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – for example, heart disease, high blood pressure, skin conditions, or anything else that’s common?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother had high blood pressure, towards the end. And my father… he had something with his stomach, I think. Ulcers, maybe? Nothing much else, to be honest. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk much anymore. Everyone on both sides pretty much… normal, I suppose. No weird skin things, no heart trouble. Just the usual old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother and a potential stomach issue, like ulcers, in your father. Now, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My wife… she smoked a little when she was young, but she stopped years ago. I always thought it was a bad habit. Never touched it myself. And… no drinking either, really. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely.
DOCTOR: Very good. No smoking and minimal alcohol consumption. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine they give me. A little bit of dust bothers my eyes sometimes, but that’s just… dust. Nothing serious. I’m pretty lucky, really. I think. It’s just this flushing… worrying me, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for that comprehensive history. It’s helpful to know you have no significant medical conditions, no surgeries, a limited family history of illness, and no allergies. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just want to figure out what’s going on. And… thank you for listening. It's nice to talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and I don't see any obvious skin abnormalities. Since there's no redness present at the moment, it's harder to assess, but I’ll make a note of the areas you described. Now, to help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are best. I don't mind. I don’t have insurance, though. Is it… very expensive? I just want to be prepared. I have a little bit of savings.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Mr. Withycombe. I understand not having insurance can make things difficult. Let me check the approximate costs for you. The tests I’m recommending will cost approximately $180. The lab does offer a cash discount of 10%, bringing the total down to $162. Would that be manageable for you?
PATIENT: $162… hmm. Yes, I think I can manage that. It’s… better than I expected. Okay, let’s do the tests. I just want to know what’s going on. And… thank you for checking on the price. That’s very kind of you. When do I need to go to the lab?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad we could find a manageable solution. I will print out a lab requisition form with the necessary tests and the lab address. The lab is located at 14 Oak Street, about a 15-minute drive from here. They are open from 8 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday, and 9 AM to 12 PM on Saturdays. You do not need to fast before the tests, but please bring a form of identification. Once the results are back – typically within 24 to 48 hours – we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'd like to ask you to keep a detailed diary of your flushing episodes. Note the time, any potential triggers , and any other symptoms you experience. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. A diary, you say. Time, triggers… I have a notepad at home. I’ll write it down. Everything. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little bit better already, knowing we’re doing something. Here. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could reassure you, Mr. Withycombe. I’ll make a note of your appointment and look forward to reviewing the results with you. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe headache – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very thorough. And kind. I really appreciate it. Thank you again for taking the time to listen. I'll go to the lab tomorrow and write down everything in my notepad. I think that's all. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m happy to help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. You have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment.
