DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. I… I am having some trouble breathing. It feels like a whistle when I breathe, sometimes. A wheezing, I think my daughter said it is called. It is not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Margret, I understand. Trouble breathing with a whistling or wheezing sound – that’s definitely something we want to look into. And it's good you have a daughter who's helping you keep track of things. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it started… That is a good question. Not very long ago, I think. Maybe… two, three weeks? It comes and goes. Some days I feel fine, and other days… like today… it is harder. I was gardening mostly when it started feeling worse. But I do not think it is just the gardening. It feels… deeper than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for about two to three weeks, comes and goes, and seems to be worse on some days than others. You also feel it’s not just from gardening, which is helpful to know. When you say "deeper," could you elaborate on that feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, I try to explain. It is not just my chest, like when I work too hard in the garden. It feels… inside my lungs, maybe? Like something is tight. And sometimes I feel a little bit… scared when I cannot get a good breath. It makes my heart beat faster, too. Not very fast, but… noticeable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Margret. It sounds like you're experiencing a sensation of tightness in your chest and lungs, and it's understandably causing some anxiety and a faster heartbeat. It's good you're aware of that connection between your breathing and how you feel. Let's go through a bit more detail. Do you notice anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specifically… Well, it is worse when I lie down flat. I have to use more pillows to prop myself up. And… dust. If I am cleaning, and there is a lot of dust, it is very bad. Also, when it is very hot and humid outside. The air feels heavy, and I have trouble. But sometimes it is bad even when it is a nice day. It is… confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lying flat, dust, and hot, humid weather seem to be triggers, but it can happen even on nice days. That does sound a bit confusing, and we’ll try to sort it out. Now, have you had any fever, cough, or chills along with this breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And… not really a cough. Maybe a little bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but not a proper cough. And no chills. I have been feeling warm because of the weather, but not a fever. I check myself, you know, with my hand. No fever. I am usually very healthy, Doctor. I like to be outside.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No fever, no significant cough, just a slight tickle in your throat. And you generally consider yourself healthy and enjoy being active. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ?
PATIENT: Asthma… hmm. I do not think so. The doctors never told me I have asthma. I had a little bit of trouble breathing when I was a child, but they said it was just growing pains. And… COPD? I do not know what that is. I am sorry. I do not remember ever being told I have any problems with my lungs. My daughter sometimes talks about things, but I forget. I am old, you know. Things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Margret. It's very common to forget things as we get older, and no need to apologize at all. We'll take our time. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and it's a lung condition that can make it hard to breathe. Since you haven’t been diagnosed with either, that’s good information. Have you ever had pneumonia or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… yes, I think so. A long time ago. When I was… maybe in my forties? I was very sick, and had to stay in bed for a long time. But that was a very long time ago. And bronchitis… I do not think so. I remember the pneumonia, but not bronchitis. It was a very scary time with the pneumonia. I was coughing a lot, and it hurt to breathe. But again, a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had pneumonia a long time ago, but no recollection of bronchitis. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your family. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – had asthma, COPD, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. My mother… she had a little bit of trouble breathing when she got older. Not like me, but she would get out of breath easily. And my brother… he smoked for a long time, and he had a bad cough. I think he had something with his lungs, but I do not remember exactly what. It was a long time ago, and we did not talk about it much. My daughter is healthy, as far as I know. She worries about me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some breathing difficulties as she aged, and your brother had lung problems related to smoking. It’s good to know about those family histories. Now, I’m going to ask about a few other things, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I do not think so. I have never had a reaction to anything. I take a little bit of medicine for my blood pressure, but the doctor said I am not allergic to it. I eat everything, mostly. I like vegetables from my garden! And I do not have any allergies to animals. I used to have a cat, and I was fine. No, I do not think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: That's good to know - no known allergies. And you're taking medication for your blood pressure, but you’re not allergic to it. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Could you tell me the name and dosage of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you are asking something difficult! I have so many little bottles… It is a white pill… a small white pill. And I take one every morning. I think it starts with an “A”… but I am not very good with names. My daughter helps me with my pills. I should have asked her before I came, but I forgot. I am sorry. I do not remember the name. But it is a small white pill, one every morning.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Margret. Don't worry about it at all. We can look it up, and I see in your chart it's Amlodipine 5mg once daily. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me if you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband smoked, a long time ago, but I told him to stop, and he did. It is very bad for you, you know. I always tell people not to smoke. I like the fresh air. Smoking is not good for your lungs. No, I do not smoke.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Margret. It's great you never smoked, and it's good your husband stopped as well. Okay, now I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is alright. Please listen. I hope you can hear what is wrong. It feels strange, this breathing. It is not normal, I know. Please listen carefully.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up as comfortably as you can, and take some nice, deep breaths for me, that would be great. Okay, I’m listening now. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, which is a whistling sound. It's not extremely loud, but it’s definitely there. I also notice you’re taking slightly deeper breaths than normal, and your chest is moving a little more with each breath. Your heart rate is 82, which is within normal limits. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is good. Your chest feels clear to the touch. No tenderness. Sounds are normal. So, all together, that suggests some airway narrowing, which can cause the wheezing we’re hearing. It's good your oxygen is good right now, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Airway narrowing? That sounds… serious. Is it my lungs? Will I need to stay in the hospital? I do not like hospitals. It is scary. And what about my garden? I need to take care of my tomatoes. Will this stop me from gardening?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Margret. "Airway narrowing" simply means that the passages your air travels through are a bit tighter than they should be, making it harder to breathe. It can be serious, but we're catching it early, and that's good. It could be related to your lungs, but it's not necessarily a major lung problem right now. It could be something like asthma, even though you haven't been diagnosed before, or it could be something else. We are not talking about a hospital stay at this point. We're going to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on, and then we can discuss a treatment plan. And we’ll absolutely try to get you back to your garden as soon as possible! I wouldn’t want to keep you from your tomatoes. To get a better idea of what’s happening, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a spirometry test – that's a breathing test where you blow into a machine to measure how much air you can exhale. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray and a breathing test… Yes, that is alright. If you think it will help me get back to my garden, I will do it. I do not like being sick, and I do not want to worry my daughter. When will I have these tests? And will they take long? I have to pick up my granddaughter from school at three o'clock.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The X-ray and spirometry test can both be done here at the clinic today. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the spirometry test will take about 15-20 minutes. We can get you scheduled right after this consultation, and you should be finished well before three o'clock to pick up your granddaughter. I'll also have my nurse, Sarah, draw some blood to check your overall health and rule out any infections. That will take just a few minutes as well. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It helps to open up your airways and make breathing easier. It's just a precaution, while we figure out what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator inhaler… Yes, that sounds good. If it will help me breathe easier, please. My daughter always says I should listen to the doctors. And Sarah, you said? She sounds very helpful. So, X-ray, breathing test, blood draw, and an inhaler. And then we wait for the results? How long will that take? And will the inhaler make me feel strange? I do not like feeling strange.
DOCTOR: Exactly. X-ray, breathing test, blood draw, and the inhaler. Sarah is wonderful; she’ll explain everything clearly. The results from the X-ray and blood draw should be back within a few hours, and the spirometry test results will take a little longer, maybe by tomorrow morning. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. The inhaler is very safe, and most people don’t experience any side effects. Some people might feel a little bit of a fluttering in their chest or a slightly faster heartbeat at first, but that usually goes away quickly. It shouldn't make you feel strange, but if you do experience any unusual side effects, please call the clinic immediately. Sarah will come in shortly to get the blood draw started and explain the inhaler instructions. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Blood draw, inhaler, wait for the results, and call if anything feels strange. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You are very kind. And I do hope it is not too serious. I just want to get back to my garden. My tomatoes are almost ripe.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could help. We’re going to do everything we can to get you feeling better and back to your tomatoes as quickly as possible. That’s the most important thing. Sarah should be in any moment now. Just relax, and we’ll take things one step at a time.
