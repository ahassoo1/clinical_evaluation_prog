DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning, Doctor. Look, my mother… she had a lot of problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And her sister, my aunt, same thing. I’m… I’m fine, perfectly healthy, but it’s just… it’s in the family, you know? I’d just like to, I guess, know everything is okay. Get some tests done, just to be sure. I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Blain. It's very sensible to be proactive, especially with a family history of heart problems. It's good you're thinking about this now. Let’s get some information down, and we’ll figure out the best course of action. First, can you tell me a little more about your mother and aunt’s heart issues?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had angina, I think that’s what they called it. Chest pain, mostly. She was always complaining about it. Then she had… a procedure. A stent, maybe? It was years ago. And my aunt… she just collapsed one day. It was… fast. They said it was a heart attack. She didn't make it. I was… young. Honestly, I don't remember a lot of the specifics. Just that it was… bad. They always said I didn’t have to worry, that I was different. But still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Angina and a heart attack… and you recall being told you weren’t likely to have the same issues. That's helpful. It’s not uncommon for family members to have different risk factors. Just to be thorough, let's run through a bit of your own medical history. Have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No. Never. I mean, nothing like what my mother described. I exercise regularly – I’m a teacher, so I’m on my feet all day. And I eat… reasonably well. I don't smoke, never have. I had a bad patch a few years ago, after the divorce, and I was… letting things slip, but I got it back together. I’m pretty healthy, really. It’s just… you know how it is. It’s in the family. I’d just like to know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Blain. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are excellent. And it’s good you addressed any unhealthy habits after your divorce – that takes strength. Okay. So, no personal history of cardiac issues. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m pretty boring that way. No allergies, no weird sensitivities. Just… a family history of heart problems. Is that enough to get some tests done, or do you need a whole life story? I mean, I appreciate you being thorough, but… I just want to rule things out.
DOCTOR: No, Blain, you’re not being boring at all. And you’re absolutely right to want to rule things out, especially with your family history. We can proceed with some testing. Just gathering information to make sure we do the right tests, and understand your overall risk. Before we talk about specific tests, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. I had to take some antibiotics after a root canal last year, but that was it. Otherwise, just… normal. I eat healthy, I exercise, I don't smoke, I don't drink excessively. I really am healthy. I just… I don't want to wake up one day and find out I have the same problem my mother and aunt did. Is that so unreasonable?
DOCTOR: No, Blain, that’s not unreasonable at all. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive. And it sounds like you’re doing a lot right to maintain your health. Alright. No medications, no allergies… Let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just get a general sense of things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. As long as it gets me closer to knowing I'm alright. I mean, I’m a bit anxious, if I’m honest. It’s just… it’s always been there, in the back of my mind. My mother complaining, my aunt… It’s just… something, you know? Just get it checked, get it over with. Let's just do the exam.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get through this. It’s completely understandable to be anxious. Just relax as much as you can. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80… perfectly normal. Pulse is 72 and steady. Everything seems within normal limits so far. But to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. And, given your family history, I’d also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to look at your heart’s electrical activity. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds thorough. Is all that necessary? I mean, I understand you’re being careful, but… it seems like a lot. I just wanted a quick check-up, maybe a few tests to rule things out. Not a full work-up. But… if you think it’s necessary, I guess. I want to be sure, obviously. Just… it’s a bit overwhelming. How long will all of this take? And how much will it cost? I have Medicare, but… you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It is a bit extensive, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. The reason I’m recommending these tests is specifically because of your family history. While your exam is normal, family history is a significant risk factor, and these tests will help us identify any potential issues before they become serious. The blood work will take about 15-20 minutes, and the EKG is quick – maybe 5 minutes. As for cost, with Medicare, you should be covered for most of it. There may be a co-pay or deductible, depending on your plan. Our billing department can give you a precise estimate. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, alright. Just… get it over with. Order the tests. I don't want to spend the rest of my life worrying about this. Just… tell me when I can come back, and what I need to do. I really just want a clean bill of health, you know? And then I can finally stop thinking about this. It's exhausting. Do I need to fast for the blood work? Will it disrupt my schedule? I teach, so… I can’t just disappear for half the day.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. You’re right, worrying is exhausting. Yes, you will need to fast for the blood work – no food or drink for 8-12 hours beforehand. That’s to ensure accurate results. We can schedule the tests for first thing in the morning on August 5th. That would give you tonight and tomorrow to prepare. It shouldn't disrupt your schedule too much, it typically takes about an hour total, including check-in and the draw. I’ll have the lab send a confirmation with fasting instructions to your email. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: August 5th… alright. That works, I guess. As long as it’s early. I need to be at school by 8:30. Okay, so I just… don't eat anything after dinner tonight? And then come here on the 5th, first thing? That’s it? No special preparations? And… will I get a copy of the results myself? I like to… keep track of things, you know? I’m an engineer, I like data. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. It’s just… a lot to deal with.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. No food or drink after dinner tonight, and come in first thing on the 5th. The lab will take care of everything else. And absolutely, you’ll receive a copy of the results – both electronically through our patient portal and a hard copy at your follow-up appointment. You’re more than welcome to review them and bring any questions you have. It’s my pleasure, Blain. I understand your concern, and I’m happy to help. It’s always best to be proactive about your health. I'll have the lab results sent to my office and we'll set up a follow-up appointment when they are back. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again. I feel a little bit better, knowing something is being done. It’s just… a weight off my shoulders. Hopefully, everything will be fine. I’ll see you on the 5th. And thank you for being patient with me. I know I can be… a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Blain. It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, and I’m happy to address any concerns you have. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll see you on August 5th. Have a good rest of your day, and don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up.
