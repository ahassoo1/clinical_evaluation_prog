DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower down. It's been hurting, quite badly at times. Honestly, it comes and goes, and it's a little hard to explain. I do have… something with my immune system, I believe? Lupus, perhaps? It’s been a while since I’ve seen a doctor about it, and the details… they’re a bit fuzzy, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. "A bit fuzzy" is alright, we can sort through it. Lupus can certainly cause abdominal discomfort. Let’s try to pinpoint this stomach pain. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That is the question, isn’t it? I… honestly, it feels like it’s been on and off for months. Maybe even longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. There was a particularly bad spell a few weeks ago, I think? That's what finally prompted me to call. Before that… it was just a nagging ache, easily dismissed. I truly apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Months, on and off. And a worse spell a few weeks ago. Okay. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, the pain… It’s… a cramping, I suppose. And a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels like a sharp stab, but that doesn't last long. It comes in waves, really. And it feels… deep inside. Not on the surface, if that makes sense. It's… unsettling. I find myself doubling over sometimes, just to get comfortable. It’s… well, it’s quite unpleasant. Is that helpful? I worry I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: It is helpful. "Cramping and a dull ache, with occasional sharp pains." And deep inside, comes in waves... I want to get a better picture of everything going on. Do anything specific make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… Specific things… I don’t believe so, not that I’ve noticed. Eating doesn’t seem to affect it, nor does lying down or standing. Sometimes, when I’m… stressed, perhaps? But I always feel a bit stressed, so it’s hard to say if that’s connected. It just… happens. Occasionally, I feel a bit bloated too, though I don't know if that's related. I'm afraid I'm not much help in identifying a trigger. Everything feels rather random, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Random… Alright. Let's move on to other things then. You mentioned something about your immune system. Lupus, you thought?
PATIENT: Yes, lupus. Or… something similar. I was diagnosed years ago, by a lovely doctor in… oh, dear. Where was it? I truly can't recall the city. It was a specialist, though, I'm certain of that. They put me on some medication, and it helped for a time. But then… well, life happened, I suppose. I stopped seeing them regularly, and the details just… faded. I do remember feeling very tired, and having some joint pain. And… a rash, sometimes. But it’s all quite hazy, I’m afraid. I apologize for being such a difficult patient.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Glymph. We'll work through it. Do you recall the name of the medication you were on?
PATIENT: Oh, the name… It was… a white pill, I believe? Small and round. And the name… it began with an ‘H’, perhaps? Or a ‘P’? No, definitely an ‘H’. Hydro… something. Hydrocortisone? No, that doesn't sound right. Or… perhaps Plaquenil? Was that it? Oh, dear. I truly wish I could be more precise. It was many years ago, and the details are simply… lost to me. I’m so very sorry. I feel rather foolish, being unable to recall something so important.
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can pull up any records from previous providers. I see some notes here… Yes, it looks like you were diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in 2010, treated with Plaquenil and a short course of prednisone. It appears you were discharged from that care in 2015. Do you recall that being accurate?
PATIENT: 2010… and Plaquenil… Yes! That is it! Plaquenil. You are an absolute lifesaver, Doctor. 2015… that sounds about right. I did move around a bit after that, and… well, I suppose I just drifted away from regular care. Thank you for finding that information. It’s a great weight off my mind, knowing that I’m not completely imagining things. Prednisone… yes, I remember that. It made me quite… puffy, I believe. But it helped in the short term. Oh, thank you again, Doctor. This is… remarkably helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We have a starting point. Now, let's get back to this abdominal pain. Since you stopped the Plaquenil, have you noticed a correlation between flares of pain and any specific activities or times of year?
PATIENT: Hmm… a correlation… that's a good question. I don't believe so, not specifically. It doesn’t seem to be tied to activity, no. And… well, I live a fairly quiet life these days. As for times of year… perhaps it’s worse in the winter? But then again, I always feel a bit more achy in the winter, so it's hard to say. I truly wish I could be more helpful. It just… comes and goes, seemingly at random. It’s frustrating, to be honest. It's hard to plan anything when you don't know when the pain will strike. Perhaps it's just… old age creeping up on me? Although I do believe I'm still quite sprightly for my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently press to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment entirely. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, alright? I do apologize in advance if I flinch; I'm rather sensitive, you see. But I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breath in… and out. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just a little… pressure, perhaps? But nothing alarming. Ooh, there… that's a bit tender, yes. But it's not excruciating, just… uncomfortable. Is that normal? I apologize again for being such a difficult patient; I always feel as if I'm exaggerating things. But it’s a little hard to ignore, you see. Perhaps it’s just gas? I do tend to… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. No guarding or rebound tenderness, just mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. That’s good. Given your history of lupus and the intermittent nature of the pain, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a flare of lupus affecting your abdomen, diverticulitis, or potentially something else. To be sure, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and a metabolic panel. And I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a CT scan… yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Thoroughness is always appreciated. I trust your judgment entirely. Diverticulitis, you said? I've heard of that. It doesn't sound pleasant. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Yes, please proceed with both tests. When would those be scheduled? And is there anything I should do to prepare? I do hope it’s nothing too serious. But I’m grateful for your attention to the matter. You’re a very kind and thorough doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology. The lab work can be done any time this week; just schedule an appointment at the front desk. The CT scan will likely be scheduled for tomorrow morning. They'll likely ask you about any allergies to contrast dye. And they may ask you to drink some fluids beforehand to stay hydrated. I’m ordering a urine analysis as well. As for contrast dye, do you have any kidney issues?
PATIENT: Kidney issues… Oh dear… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. My regular doctor, years ago, mentioned something about… elevated creatinine levels, perhaps? But it wasn’t anything alarming, just something to keep an eye on. I haven't had any specific kidney problems, no. Just… slightly elevated levels, I believe. It was many years ago, though. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn't what it used to be. Would it be best to check with my old doctor before the CT scan, just to be safe? I certainly don’t want to cause any complications.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea. Yes, I recommend contacting your previous doctor to confirm your creatinine levels and whether it's safe for you to receive contrast dye. I’ll put a note on the CT scan order for the radiology department as well. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Emergency room for severe pain… yes, that makes perfect sense. I will definitely keep that in mind. I will contact my old doctor immediately, and I’m very grateful for your thoroughness. Hmm… let me see. I suppose… what are the chances that this is just a flare-up of the lupus? And what does that generally entail? I remember being quite fatigued and achy during previous flare-ups, but I don’t recall any specific abdominal pain. I suppose everyone experiences things differently, though. Perhaps that’s a silly question. You’ve already been very helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all. Lupus can present in many different ways, and abdominal pain can be a symptom of a lupus flare. It could be inflammation of the serosa – the lining of the abdomen – or even affect the intestines. However, given your age and the intermittent nature of the pain, it's important to rule out other possibilities as well. Once we have the blood work and CT scan results, we’ll have a better idea of what’s going on and can discuss a treatment plan. For now, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and staying hydrated. Are there any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: Hydrated and monitor… yes, that sounds sensible. Serosa… you see, I always forget the medical terms. No, I believe that answers my questions for now, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and thorough, and I feel much more reassured. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my rambling and for ordering the necessary tests. I truly appreciate it. I shall contact my old doctor immediately and schedule the tests. Please, let me know if you need anything further from me. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. You’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule your appointment. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Glymph, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this. Take care.
