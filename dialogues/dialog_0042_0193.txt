DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Vodzak. It is very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’m having… a lot of gas. More than usual. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… uncomfortable. I didn’t really know where else to go.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to come in about something like this, Mr. Goodstein – we address all sorts of concerns here. It's good you came in to get it checked out. "Increased flatulence"… alright. And when you say "a little while now," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… about three weeks, maybe a little more? It started gradually, just a little extra after meals, but it’s gotten worse each week. I didn't pay too much attention at first, thinking it was just something I ate. But now… it happens several times a day, even when I haven’t eaten much. It's… quite disruptive. I am sorry to be so… detailed.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Goodstein. Details are very helpful. Three weeks, progressive worsening... alright. And is it associated with any particular foods?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. I have been eating more cabbage lately. My neighbor, she makes a very good sauerkraut, and I enjoy it very much. I also had a big plate of beans last week. But it happens even when I don’t eat cabbage or beans. Sometimes it happens after just a simple sandwich. That’s what’s confusing me. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm, that is interesting. Cabbage and beans are certainly known to cause gas, but if it's happening with other foods as well, that suggests something else might be going on. To get a better picture, could you describe the gas itself?
PATIENT: The gas… well, it smells normal, I think. Not… bad, not particularly unpleasant. Just… gassy. It’s mostly just… volume. A lot of it. It doesn’t cause me pain, exactly, but it feels… bloated. Uncomfortable. And it’s… loud. Very loud. It makes me a little embarrassed to be around people, sometimes. I hope that is not too much information.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. We need to know all of this. “Normal smell, increased volume, associated with bloating, no pain… embarrassment.” Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. That is a good question, Doctor. I have been… going to the bathroom more often. Not diarrhea, exactly. Just… more frequently. And it's… looser than usual. It’s not a big problem, but I am noticing it. Everything feels… unsettled, I suppose. It started around the same time as the gas, maybe a week or two later.
DOCTOR: Alright, increased frequency and looser stools alongside the gas and bloating… That helps to build a clearer picture. Now, thinking beyond just your stomach and bowels, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I have been feeling a little tired lately. More tired than usual. And maybe a little… hungry, even after I eat. Not a strong hunger, but a sort of… empty feeling. I thought it was just because of the weather, it's been very hot. And… I think I have lost a little weight. But I haven’t weighed myself recently, so I am not sure. I am not feeling sick, if that makes sense. No fever, no chills, no aches. Just… a bit off.
DOCTOR: "Fatigue, increased appetite with sensation of being unfilled, possible weight loss… no fever, chills or aches." Okay. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any changes to your diet recently, besides the sauerkraut?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I eat pretty much the same things every day. Sandwiches, soup, sometimes a little bit of meat. I try to eat healthy. I drink plenty of water. I haven’t started any new medications or anything like that. My neighbor did give me some herbal tea last week, but I only had one cup. It tasted… unusual. I don't think that would be it, though. It was a gift, I didn’t ask for it.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Herbal teas can sometimes cause digestive upset, so it’s good you mentioned it. Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. It sounds like we have a pretty good start to understanding what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and feel it gently to check for any tenderness or swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I would like to know what is causing this, if possible. I am not enjoying feeling so… unsettled. I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Mr. Goodstein. That's what I'm here for. Alright. Please lie down on the examination table for me. Okay… I'm listening now. I hear some normal bowel sounds, perhaps a little bit more active than usual, but nothing alarming. Now I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. I'll be feeling for any tenderness or swelling. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Hmm… There's a little bit of mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but nothing significant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. And I don’t feel any masses or enlarged organs. Okay… everything feels relatively normal. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please continue. I appreciate you being so thorough. I am feeling a little anxious, to be honest, but I am trying to stay calm. Is it possible this is just… something I ate? Perhaps a bad batch of sauerkraut? Or maybe just the stress of the hot weather? I worry sometimes. I live alone, you see. And I don’t want to become a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Mr. Goodstein, especially when you're experiencing something new and unsettling. And yes, it is possible this is related to something you ate, like a bad batch of sauerkraut. Or even just the stress of the heat. However, given the progressive nature of your symptoms – the increased frequency of bowel movements, the bloating, the fatigue – I think we need to rule out a few other possibilities just to be sure. There are several things that could cause these symptoms. It could be something as simple as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or a mild food intolerance. But it could also be something more serious, like a mild infection or even a subtle inflammatory process in your gut. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few blood tests and a stool sample analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a stool sample… yes, that is alright. If that is what you recommend, then I trust your judgment. I would like to know what is causing this, even if it is something unpleasant. I would rather know, than just… worry. Will the tests be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it is not too long. I have a small appointment with my neighbor next week, and I would like to know what is going on before then. I do not want to worry her unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to think of your neighbor, Mr. Goodstein. And you are right to want to know what’s going on. The blood tests are relatively simple – just a small sample taken from your arm. There may be a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. The stool sample is also straightforward – you'll be given a container and instructions on how to collect a small sample at home. It’s not pleasant, but it’s not invasive. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample for ova and parasites, as well as fecal calprotectin to check for inflammation. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. I'll call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding foods that seem to trigger your symptoms – like cabbage, for now. We can also try a low-FODMAP diet if your symptoms don’t improve. I can provide you with a list of foods to avoid. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is very helpful. Three to five business days… I can manage that. And I appreciate the suggestions about the fluids and smaller meals. I will definitely try that. Um… yes, I do have one question. You mentioned a low-FODMAP diet. What exactly is that? And… is it difficult? I am not a very good cook, you see. I mostly eat simple things. I do not want to make things worse, by trying something complicated. And… is there anything I should be worried about, while I am waiting for the results? Should I avoid going out, or… be careful about what I eat? I do not want to get sick, or… make anyone else sick. I apologize for all the questions. I am just… worried.
DOCTOR: You are not bothering me at all, Mr. Goodstein. It's good you're asking questions. A low-FODMAP diet stands for low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. It's essentially a diet that reduces certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult for some people to digest, and which can cause gas, bloating, and other digestive symptoms. It's not a permanent diet, it’s more of an elimination diet to help identify which foods might be triggering your symptoms. It can seem complicated at first, but there are plenty of resources available to help. I can give you a list of foods to avoid, as well as a list of foods that are safe to eat. It does require some planning, but you don't have to be a gourmet cook. We're just trying to simplify your diet for a short period of time. While you're waiting for the results, there's no need to isolate yourself or be overly cautious. Just continue to drink plenty of fluids, eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid foods that seem to trigger your symptoms. And if you develop any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools – please call me immediately. Otherwise, just try to relax and take things one day at a time. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that answers everything, for now. A low-FODMAP diet… I will try to find some information about that. And I will be careful about what I eat. And I will call you if anything changes. Thank you very much, Doctor Vodzak. You have been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little bit better, knowing that we are trying to figure this out. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I believe that is all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was my pleasure. And please, don't apologize for taking your time – that’s what I’m here for. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. And if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein. And please, take care of yourself. .
