DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know... about my people. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do testing, with spit, to find out? I’m Laury, by the way. Just Laury.
DOCTOR: Yes, Laury, it’s very nice to meet you as well. That’s…a very interesting question. I understand you’re curious about your ancestry and where your people originate from. There are genetic tests available that can provide information about your heritage using a saliva sample, yes. However, those tests aren’t typically something we do here at the clinic, as it falls more under the realm of specialized genetic counseling. But, I can certainly help you find resources to explore that option if you’d like. Before we go down that path, though, perhaps you could tell me a little more about why you're interested in this now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. I see. Not here, you say? That’s alright. I just… I’m old, Doctor. Real old. And I never asked my mama, or my papa. They didn’t talk much about the old days. Just fishing, and building boats. But I always feel… like something’s missing. Like a piece of the story. I want to know where my family really come from. Before the fishing, and the boats. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Laury. Absolutely. It's very common, especially as we get older, to want to connect with our roots and understand where we come from. It sounds like it's important to you to fill in those gaps in your family's history. Before we focus solely on genetic testing, which can be costly and doesn’t always provide a complete picture, perhaps we could talk a little bit about your health history?
PATIENT: Health history? Oh. Yes. Okay. What do you want to know? I been pretty good, mostly. Little aches and pains, what you expect. I mostly just... slow down. Not much fishing these days.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally well. "Slowing down" is very common at your age, and perfectly natural. We'll definitely talk about managing any aches and pains. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Never had any of those things. The doctors, they always said I was strong. Just... normal aches. You know, from working with wood. Building things. And sometimes, my knee, it bothers me when it rains. But that’s just old man stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Laury. “Strong” is good! And you’re right, knee pain with the weather is very common. We'll certainly address that. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything serious?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, not even when I was little. Scraped my knee a few times, fell out of a boat once, but that's it. Mama patched me up good.
DOCTOR: That’s remarkable, Laury! Truly. You’ve been very fortunate. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription pills, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little bit of fish oil. The store man said it’s good for your brain. I take one every morning. And sometimes, when my knee really bothers me, I take those… the white pills. For pain. I can’t remember the name. But not all the time, just when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, fish oil for the brain and a pain reliever for your knee, as needed. Do you remember what the pain reliever is called?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. I just ask for the ones… for aches and pains. The store man knows what I want. It's a little white pill. I think it starts with a ‘T’? Maybe?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Laury. We can figure it out. Do you happen to know the dosage, how many milligrams are in the pill?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I don’t know those numbers. I just take one, or two, when my knee hurts. The box… I throw the box away. I just keep the pills in a little jar.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly fine. We can try to identify it later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any allergies. Not to anything. I eat everything. Fish, mostly. And taro. And whatever my mama cooked.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Now, thinking about your family…are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Long gone. Mama passed away when I was… oh, maybe thirty? Papa, a few years after that. I have… I had a sister, but she moved away a long time ago. To America, I think. I haven’t seen her since I was a little boy.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any children of your own, Laury?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any children. Didn’t… didn’t get married. Just me. Always been just me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that with me, Laury. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. Never liked the smell. Always thought it was bad for you. Mama didn’t smoke, and Papa didn’t either.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, sometimes. With friends, long time ago. Not much these days. Maybe a small glass of beer on a special occasion. But nothing regular. Not a drinker, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we move on, let me ask, have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or memory lately?
PATIENT: Well… my eyes, they aren’t so good anymore. Hard to read small things. And sometimes… sometimes I forget what I was talking about. Little things. But… I’m old, Doctor! That’s just what happens, right?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal at your age, Laury. It's very common to experience some changes in vision and memory as we get older. Now, I know you mentioned wanting to explore your ancestry, and we can certainly discuss resources for that after we finish discussing your health. But first, let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and see how things are functioning. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. You check me. See what’s still working.
DOCTOR: Great. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, we’ll do a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Alright, Laury, relax your arm for me. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm… There we go. Now, just breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 135 over 80. Your pulse is 72 and regular. That's within a normal range for your age. Now, let's listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular and there are no murmurs or unusual sounds. Good. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Your lungs are clear and there are no wheezes or crackles. Very good. Now, let's take a look in your ears…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. You do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear, with no signs of infection or wax buildup. Good. Now, let’s take a look at your nose and throat… Your nose and throat look clear as well. No signs of any problems. Now, let’s do a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. Follow your finger…
DOCTOR: Very good. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: There. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That's good. Your grip strength is strong. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap your knee with this little hammer. Okay, your knee jerk is present and normal. Now, let's do a quick balance test. Can you stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Laury. Your gait is steady and your balance seems good. Okay, everything looks good so far. Based on the physical exam and what you’ve told me, there doesn’t seem to be anything immediately concerning. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. You checked me good. It's just… about my people. What do we do about that?
DOCTOR: Okay, Laury. Let’s talk about that. As I mentioned earlier, there are genetic ancestry tests available. These tests typically involve a saliva sample, and they can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins and potentially connect you with distant relatives. However, it's important to understand the limitations. The results are estimates based on comparisons to existing databases, and they're not always completely accurate. Also, they can be expensive, costing several hundred dollars. And, importantly, they won't tell you the full story of your family's history. There are also resources available to help you research your family history through traditional methods, like census records, birth certificates, and immigration documents. This can be a more time-consuming process, but it can provide a richer and more detailed understanding of your ancestors. Would you like me to provide you with information about genetic ancestry testing companies and family history research resources?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Both, if you can. The testing… and the old papers. I want to know everything. Maybe the old papers first? It sounds… harder, but maybe more real.
DOCTOR: Okay, Laury, that sounds like a great plan. I’ll print out some information for you on family history research resources. It includes links to online databases like Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org, as well as information about local libraries and historical societies that can help you get started. Here you go. It also includes some tips on how to navigate these resources and interpret the information you find. It may take some time and effort, but it can be very rewarding. I'll also give you a list of genetic ancestry testing companies. Here’s some information on those, as well. Please read the information carefully before making any decisions. And finally, given your age and the fact that you're exploring your health history, I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in a few months to discuss any concerns that may arise. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. A follow-up… yes, that’s a good idea. Just to make sure everything’s alright. Thank you again. Maybe I'll start with the old papers. See what I can find.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Laury. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I truly hope you find the information you’re looking for. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
