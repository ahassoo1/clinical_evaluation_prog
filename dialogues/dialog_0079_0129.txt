DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get this over with. It's my stool. It's… dark. Black, really. And it’s been going on for a bit now. I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been on 'em for years. I figure it’s probably something to do with those. Honestly, doctors these days… always something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hatchard, and I assure you we do aim to be thorough. Dark, black stool is certainly something we need to investigate. You mentioned pain pills for arthritis – are those the only medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you start with that "thorough" nonsense. I’ve been taking those pills – naproxen, I think it’s called – for… well, a long time. And a little water pill for my ankles, sometimes. Furosemide. But that’s it. Just the usual things for an old lady. And vitamins, naturally. Everyone takes vitamins. Are we going to write down everything I’ve ever swallowed?
DOCTOR: It's important to have a complete picture, Ms. Hatchard. The naproxen and furosemide are noted. And yes, we will document all medications, including vitamins, for your safety. Now, regarding this dark stool… has it been consistently black, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Consistently! What do you think I was doing, keeping a log of it? Honestly. It's been black for...oh, at least a week, maybe longer. I stopped paying close attention after a couple of days. It's not like it's a pleasant topic of conversation, you know. It just is. Dark. Black. Like tar, almost. Now, can we just get this sorted so I can get on with my day? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A week or longer of consistently black, tarry stools is concerning, Ms. Hatchard. It suggests possible bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – any weakness, dizziness, fatigue, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Oh, for goodness sake. Now you're telling me I'm bleeding? Honestly, I haven’t fallen or anything. No, I haven’t noticed any dizziness, no. A little tired, maybe, but I’m 73! Of course I'm tired. And my stomach… well, it grumbles sometimes. Doesn't everyone’s? But no real pain, no. Just… old lady things. I swear, doctors always make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and occasional stomach grumbling are noted, Ms. Hatchard. While it’s true many things can cause these symptoms, the black stool warrants a more thorough investigation. I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, and then I'll need to order some laboratory tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Laboratory tests? Oh, wonderful. Just what I needed. Look, is this going to be expensive? Medicare barely covers anything these days. And poking and prodding? I don't like being poked and prodded. But... I suppose if you have to. Just get it over with quickly, alright? And tell me what it's going to cost before you start.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Ms. Hatchard. We will submit everything to Medicare, and their coverage will be applied. Any potential out-of-pocket expenses will be discussed with our billing department after the tests are completed. As for the examination, it will be relatively quick – I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and perhaps feel your stomach to assess for any tenderness. First, let’s take a look at your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don't expect much. It's just old age, I tell you. Honestly, the things one has to go through… And make it quick, alright? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. Just relax. Deep breaths… Now, I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope. Not really. A little… stiff, maybe. But that’s just age, again. Honestly, I've had two children, so I know what real pain feels like. This is nothing. Are you done yet? You’re poking around like a… well, never mind. Just hurry up. I’ve got a garden to tend to, you know. And I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is mildly tender to palpation, but no acute distention or masses noted. Alright, Ms. Hatchard. Based on your symptoms and the examination, I'm concerned about possible gastrointestinal bleeding. To determine the source and severity, I'd like to order a Complete Blood Count to check your hemoglobin levels, a stool occult blood test to confirm the presence of blood, and an upper endoscopy. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? What in the world is an endoscopy? Oh, don’t tell me… is that where you stick a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! I’ve heard stories, you know. I am not having a camera stuck down my throat. No way. Just give me something for the pain pills and be done with it. I'm perfectly capable of knowing what's wrong with me, thank you very much. It's the pills, I tell you! It has to be. Just stop with the poking and prodding and the fancy tests. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, please remain seated. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, we would explain the procedure thoroughly. An upper endoscopy allows us to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to identify the source of the bleeding. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause. However, I respect your wishes. While I strongly recommend the endoscopy, we can begin with the CBC and stool occult blood test. If those results are significantly abnormal, I will need to insist on further investigation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But just the blood tests, then. And don’t you try to trick me into that camera thing later. I’ll be watching you. Honestly, doctors these days… always wanting to do something complicated. It’s just a little dark stool! Now, hurry up and get it over with. I’ve got a schedule, you know. A garden doesn’t tend itself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hatchard. We will proceed with the CBC and stool occult blood test as requested. I will have the lab technician draw the blood now, and you can collect a stool sample in the designated collection room. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available. Please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment once you’ve completed the tests. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. And don’t bother calling me unless it's to tell me everything is fine and it was the pills. Honestly, the whole thing has been a waste of my time. Good day. .
