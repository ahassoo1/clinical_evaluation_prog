DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s rather… obvious, isn’t it? One doesn’t simply enjoy wasting one’s time. I was informed by… someone… that I should come discuss this… stress. Though frankly, I fail to see what there is to discuss. It’s the students, you see. Utterly lacking in discipline. A dreadful lot of them. I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time. Long enough to know a bad batch when I see one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing stress related to your work with students, and that it’s been a long-standing issue. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about what specifically is causing you stress?
PATIENT: “Specifically”? Goodness. Where does one begin? They don’t read, you see. They simply… don't. And when they do, they haven’t the slightest comprehension. It's a… a lowering of standards, I tell you. A dreadful lowering. And the noise! The incessant chatter. It’s… barbaric. Honestly, I used to run a tight ship. A very tight ship. But… things are different now. Much different. I don’t quite recall all the specifics, to be frank. It’s all rather… blurring together.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating to feel like you're losing control of your classroom and that the students aren’t meeting your expectations. And it's understandable that it would be difficult to maintain your usual standards when things are changing. You mentioned it’s all blurring together. Has this been a gradual change, or did something specific happen that made things worse recently?
PATIENT: “Gradual”? Oh, yes, I suppose. Though I really couldn’t pinpoint a date, if you must know. It’s been… years. A slow erosion of… everything. There was… a new curriculum, I believe. Something about “inclusivity.” Honestly, it's all rather pointless. And then… a new administrator. A very… young administrator. Kept suggesting… “different approaches.” As if I needed advice! I’ve been teaching for… well, never mind. It’s all rather… tiresome. Are we nearly finished? I have a rather important manuscript I need to review.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the changes and feeling like your experience isn’t being valued. It sounds like these changes—the new curriculum and administrator—have added to your stress. To get a better understanding of how this is affecting you physically and emotionally, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: “How I’ve been feeling”? Really? Must we delve into such… personal matters? I came here because someone suggested it might be a… formality. Not to recount my emotional state to a complete stranger. However… if you insist. But do be brief. I haven't the patience for a lengthy… examination. I sleep, I suppose. And I eat. Though my appetite hasn’t been quite what it used to be. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I'm a perfectly rational man. I don't need… coddling.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Schlatterer, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. We can certainly keep it brief. You mentioned your appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? A little, perhaps. Though it’s hardly a matter of concern. I’ve always been… slender. It’s a family trait. Besides, one doesn’t require a hearty appetite to maintain a sharp intellect. It's the students who could benefit from a reduction in… consumption, frankly. They seem to spend more time eating than reading. And the noise they make! It's appalling. Really, I fail to see what this has to do with anything. Are we getting anywhere with this… process? I have a great deal to do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schlatterer. Even a small amount of unintentional weight loss can be a helpful piece of information. Aside from your appetite and weight, have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well… it comes and goes. I wouldn’t say it’s been… restful, precisely. I find myself… thinking. A great deal of thinking. About the students, about the curriculum, about the… general decline of society. Honestly, it’s rather exhausting. And the noise! Even at night, I sometimes hear… echoes. Though that may simply be my imagination. Are we nearing a conclusion? I truly must be going. This is… unproductive.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty sleeping, and that your mind is often racing with thoughts about your work and other concerns. Now, have you been experiencing any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: “Sadness”? “Hopelessness”? Good heavens, no! I am a rational man. I do not succumb to… emotions. I find the entire line of questioning rather… insulting, frankly. I am perfectly capable of conducting my own self-assessment, thank you very much. I simply came here because… well, never mind. This is a waste of my time. I believe I’ve answered your… inquiries. Are we finished? I have a manuscript awaiting my review. And frankly, I'm beginning to feel quite unwell. This… stress, I presume. Though I suspect it's more likely boredom. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I apologize if I’ve caused any offense. It seems you’re quite resolute in your assessment of the situation. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're experiencing stress related to changes at work and perhaps some difficulty sleeping and appetite changes. While you feel you don’t require further intervention, I would recommend considering some strategies to manage stress, such as relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises. I can provide you with some resources if you’re interested. If your symptoms worsen, or if you begin to feel overwhelmed, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m also happy to discuss a referral to a therapist if you change your mind. .
