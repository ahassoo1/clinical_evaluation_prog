DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mr. Tkac. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today to get cleared for a senior living facility. My daughter thought it best, and I… well, I trust her judgment. It’s a big step, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Tkac. It is a big step. And it’s wonderful you have a supportive daughter. We want to make sure you’re as prepared and comfortable as possible. To get you cleared, I’ll need to do a bit of a check-up, just to make sure everything’s looking good. First, let's talk a little bit about why your daughter suggested senior living now. Has anything changed recently that led to this conversation?
PATIENT: Well, nothing sudden, Doctor. It’s just… things are becoming more difficult. I still bake, you see. Always have. But lifting the heavy flour sacks… that’s getting to be a problem. And remembering all the ingredients… sometimes I misread the recipe. Small things, mostly. But my daughter, bless her heart, worries. She says I shouldn’t strain myself. I agree with her, mostly. It’s just hard to give up a lifetime of work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like you’re still very capable, and it’s admirable that you’re still baking! It is hard to adjust to needing a little help. Those little things can definitely add up, and it's smart of your daughter to be proactive. Okay, so lifting and memory are the main concerns right now. Let's get a little more specific. When you say remembering ingredients, how often is this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not every time, Doctor. Perhaps… once or twice a week? Usually, it’s something small, like forgetting the vanilla extract, or using baking soda instead of powder. Nothing disastrous, thankfully. My customers haven’t complained yet. But it does worry me, to be honest. I always prided myself on a perfect loaf.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and it's good that you're aware of it. Once or twice a week is helpful information. And I appreciate your honesty about being worried – that’s very important. Now, aside from the baking, are you noticing any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me see… sometimes I have trouble recalling names, you know? Not people I see every day, but… acquaintances, folks I haven’t seen in a while. And occasionally, I’ll misplace my glasses. Though, to be fair, I’ve always been a bit forgetful with those. But no, nothing major, really. I still know who my daughter is, and I can still tell you all about the Lakota way of life. That part hasn't faded.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring to hear, Mr. Tkac. Knowing you’re still connected to your identity and family is very important. Okay, so memory lapses mostly seem to be with names and occasionally misplacing things. Let's move on to other areas. How is your energy level these days?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I tire more easily than I used to. A full day of baking, like I’m accustomed to, leaves me quite worn out. I need a good long nap afterwards. And walking… the hills around here are lovely, but I don’t get out as much. It’s not pain, necessarily, just… fatigue. It’s like the engine isn’t running as smoothly, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Tkac. That makes sense, especially at 81. Fatigue and needing more rest are common. Now, thinking about your past health, have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had a touch of pneumonia many years ago, when I was a young man. Recovered fully, though. And my knees, they’ve bothered me for years, just the usual wear and tear. The doctor said it was arthritis. Nothing serious enough for medicine, just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. Other than that… no, not really. I've always been a strong Lakota man, and I've been fortunate enough to avoid most serious illness. I've always eaten well too. Mostly. A little too much frybread sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Pneumonia a long time ago and some arthritis, but generally good health. Frybread in moderation is perfectly acceptable! Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had a surgery. Always tried to avoid them if possible. My grandmother used to say the spirits don’t like being disturbed by sharp things. A bit superstitious, perhaps, but I’ve always been careful. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a boy, climbing trees, being foolish. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No surgeries, just a few childhood stitches. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with a history of memory problems, like Alzheimer's or dementia?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she became forgetful in her later years. Not severe, but she would repeat herself often, and sometimes didn’t recognize family members. We didn’t have doctors like we do now back then, so we didn’t have a proper diagnosis. My aunt, on my father’s side, she suffered from… well, a similar condition. It saddened us all. It was a long time ago. But yes, there has been some history of memory loss in the family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Tkac. That is important information to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, Doctor. Something the local pharmacist recommended a few years back. It’s an anti-inflammatory, I believe. I take it when they’re particularly stiff. And sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, since we don’t get much sun here. Other than that… no, nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, an anti-inflammatory for your knees and Vitamin D. Do you happen to know the name of the anti-inflammatory?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a little white pill… I believe the name is… Naproxen. Yes, that’s it. Naproxen. I take one or two a day, depending on how my knees are feeling. It helps a little, mostly with the stiffness. I get it refilled at the pharmacy down the street. Old Man Hemlock knows what I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen as needed for your knees. That's helpful. Now, just one last question about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My father was a strong man, and he instilled in me the importance of a clean life. And smoking… well, that’s just foolish. It harms the body. And recreational drugs… no, never had any interest in such things. I’ve always found plenty of enjoyment in baking, and spending time with my daughter. A simple life, but a good one.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like you've lived a very healthy life, and that’s commendable. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your vital signs and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what I need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. I used to be a very good tracker, you know. Keen eyesight was essential. Although, I admit, it’s not quite as sharp as it once was. But I can still follow your finger. No problem at all.
DOCTOR: Good. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but symmetrical. Balance is a little unsteady, but you're able to maintain your footing. Now, I’m going to check your memory a little more formally. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, in a few minutes, I’ll ask you to recall them again. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Apple, table, penny. Those are easy enough to remember. Simple things. Apple, table, penny. I believe I have them.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's quickly assess your gait. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. I try to keep moving, you see. My daughter says it’s important. Not as quick as I once was, but I can still walk.
DOCTOR: Your gait is a little slow and shuffling, and your steps are a little shorter than usual. There's a slight tremor in your hands, which is also common with age. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your orientation to time and place. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Today is… August 2nd. Yes, August 2nd. And the year… 2025, isn't it? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I try to keep track of the days. It’s important to remember.
DOCTOR: Very good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor. In your clinic here in… well, in the countryside, aren't we? A lovely, quiet place. It's a bit of a drive for my daughter, but worth it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac. That concludes the physical exam. Now, let’s revisit those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you recall them for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… apple… table… Oh dear. I seem to be having a bit of trouble with the third one. Apple… table… Was it… penny? Yes, I believe it was penny. Apple, table, penny. But it took me a moment, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Tkac. Based on the exam and your history, it appears you have some mild cognitive impairment, likely related to age. The difficulty recalling the three words, along with the unsteady gait and slight tremor, are consistent with that. Your memory lapses and fatigue are also contributing factors. It's important to note that this is not necessarily Alzheimer's disease, but further investigation is needed to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other conditions that can affect cognitive function. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a neurologist… yes, I’m comfortable with that. It’s good to know what we’re dealing with, if possible. I trust your judgment. It's just… a little unsettling, to be honest. But I’d rather know than worry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tkac. It’s perfectly natural to feel unsettled. We're going to take this one step at a time. The blood work and neurologist will give us a clearer picture. In the meantime, it’s important to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle: getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and staying physically and mentally active. And it’s wonderful that you have a supportive daughter. Regarding your clearance for the senior living facility, I’m comfortable with you being admitted, with the understanding that we're still investigating these cognitive concerns. The facility will need to be aware of our findings and provide appropriate support. I will provide them with a summary of your exam and recommend close monitoring. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. To proceed with the facility, but with monitoring and your report. That feels… right. My daughter will be pleased. She’s very thorough, you see. And she’ll want to make sure I’m well cared for. Thank you, Doctor. For being so… understanding. And for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you're in good hands with your daughter. Okay, let's get those blood work orders sent to the lab. I’ll also prepare a referral to a neurologist – Dr. Anya Sharma is a good specialist in this area. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, contact you to schedule the appointments. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything. My daughter will undoubtedly have questions, but I’m alright for now. Just… thank you again. For your time, your patience, and your kindness. It means a great deal. I think I’ll go home and have a cup of tea. And perhaps do a little baking.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Mr. Tkac. A cup of tea and a little baking – a perfect afternoon. I’ll have Sarah come in to go over the discharge instructions and schedule those appointments. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Tkac. Take care, and enjoy your tea and baking.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I appreciate your kindness. I believe I will. A little baking always makes things better. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Tkac. Take care!
