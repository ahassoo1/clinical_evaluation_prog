DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think? Maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin. And you said a few weeks to a month… is it all over, or just in certain spots?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and my back, I’d say. And my legs a little. Not on my face, thankfully. It’s just… constant. Like little needles. You know? I scratch and scratch, but it doesn't really help for long.
DOCTOR: Constant itching… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions. I did change laundry detergents, now that you mention it. Maybe two months ago? Something with a new scent, my granddaughter picked it out for me. She means well, always trying to help. But it is possible that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, new laundry detergent… that’s a good starting point. And aside from the itching, have you noticed any rash, bumps, blisters, or changes in the appearance of your skin?
PATIENT: No, no rash or bumps. It just looks… normal, really. A little dry maybe, but I always have dry skin in the summer with the air conditioning. It’s just red when I scratch it, of course. But not like… raised or anything. Just red and irritated.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I eat everything! I love cooking, you know? Puerto Rican food has a lot of different spices and flavors. Never had a problem. I get a little heartburn sometimes, but that’s just from eating too much, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, a small pill. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they're acting up. That's it, really. Oh! And sometimes a little something to help me sleep, but not every night. Just when I can’t get comfortable. I don't even remember the name of that one. It’s… a little white pill. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed, and a sleep aid… we'll try to get the name of that one later. Do you have any other medical problems – diabetes, heart issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my doctor told me my cholesterol is a little high, so I try to eat healthy. And my knees, like I said, they bother me sometimes. Arthritis, I guess. But nothing else major, really. I’ve been pretty lucky so far, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough… any family history of skin problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mother had eczema when she was a little girl, I think. But I never did. And my grandmother, she had really sensitive skin. Always had to be careful with the sun. But nobody with anything really bad, you know? Nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's take a quick look at your skin. If you don't mind. Just want to rule out anything obvious. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever I can to figure this out. It’s just… so annoying.
DOCTOR: Please, go ahead. I’ll just need to examine your arms, back, and legs. Let me just start by looking at your arms… Can you raise them for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There, like that? Be careful, my arthritis sometimes makes me a little stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Skin appears generally normal in color. I do see some mild dryness, and a few small areas of redness, particularly around the elbows. No visible rash or blisters. Now, if you could turn around, please, so I can take a look at your back.
PATIENT: Oh, be gentle, Doctor. It's a little hard to move sometimes. And I get cold easily, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Similar findings on your back – mild dryness and some small areas of redness. No rash or significant abnormalities. And finally, let’s take a look at your legs. Could you lift one up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, this is a little hard on my knees, Doctor. But I can manage. Just let me know if you need me to move it a certain way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Again, mild dryness and some small areas of redness. No rash. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a mild irritant contact dermatitis. The new laundry detergent is the most likely culprit.
PATIENT: Oh! That laundry detergent! I figured it might be that. My granddaughter insisted it smelled so nice. So what do I do about it, Doctor? Do I need some kind of cream? And is it… serious?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not serious, Ms. Cassimatis. It’s very common. We can try a few things. First, I recommend stopping use of the new detergent immediately. Go back to whatever you were using before. Second, I'm going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day for two weeks. That should help reduce the inflammation and itching. Third, make sure to keep your skin well-moisturized, especially after bathing. A fragrance-free lotion is best.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… manageable. So, just stop the detergent, the cream, and lotion. Okay, I can do that. And how long before I should feel better, Doctor? I’ve been scratching like crazy! And is there anything else I should be doing? Like, special soaps or anything?
DOCTOR: You should start to see improvement within a few days of stopping the detergent and starting the cream. It may take a week or two for it to completely clear up. As for soaps, use a mild, fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid anything with dyes or perfumes. And avoid scratching as much as possible, I know that's easier said than done. Keep your fingernails short and clean. I’m going to write you a prescription for the cream, and I'll give you a handout with these instructions. If it doesn’t improve after two weeks, or if it gets worse, please call the office and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your help. I was really worried it was something serious. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And the handout is a good idea, I tend to forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It's no problem at all. I'm glad I could reassure you. Here's the prescription and the handout. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day. I need to see my next patient, but the nurse will be with you in a moment to schedule a follow-up, if needed. .
PATIENT: .
