DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Shaub, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Tierney Shaub. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor Sink.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not waste time with pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, I requested a test for HIV. It’s… something I wanted to get checked, just to be sure. I haven’t been feeling unwell, but with everything going around, I thought it was best to know.
DOCTOR: An HIV test. Right. And you haven’t… exhibited any particular symptoms that prompted this?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Like I said, I feel perfectly fine. It’s more of a… preventative measure, I suppose. My husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, but one can never be too careful, can one?
DOCTOR: “One can never be too careful.” A sentiment, certainly. Though, frankly, it seems a bit… unnecessary, given your stated circumstances. Still. We’ll proceed. Have you had any previous HIV tests?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe… no, I don’t think I have. Not that I recall, anyway. It wasn’t something we discussed much when we were younger, truthfully. Things were different then.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My husband and I… we are. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, nearly forty years now. A long time. And we are faithful to each other, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Faithful is… reassuring, to a degree. But we still need a thorough history. Have either of you had any… encounters outside of your marriage?
PATIENT: Oh my. That is… a rather personal question, isn’t it? No, Doctor, absolutely not. Neither of us has ever been unfaithful. We’ve always been very committed to one another. I assure you. It feels a bit… intrusive to ask such a thing, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: “Intrusive” is a necessary component of a proper medical evaluation, Mrs. Shaub. It's not a social call. Very well. Any history of blood transfusions?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any blood transfusions, not ever. And neither has my husband, to my knowledge. We’ve both been quite healthy, thankfully. Although, I did have a rather bad bout of malaria when I was visiting Nigeria a few years ago, but I was treated right away. Would that be relevant?
DOCTOR: Malaria, yes, I suppose that could be relevant. Though, unlikely. Do you use any… recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. My husband and I… we don’t partake in anything like that. Never have, never will. We prefer a nice cup of tea, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your… history—or lack thereof—we can proceed with the test. Though I must say, this seems rather… unwarranted. We will need a blood sample. Follow the nurse to the lab.
PATIENT: Alright. Very well. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’ll go find the nurse then. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Don’t take all day.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Honestly. The things I have to deal with… .
