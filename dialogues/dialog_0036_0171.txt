DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Uh, my nails. They just...look funny. Not good funny. I don't even know why I’m here, really. Just felt like I should get ‘em looked at. They changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re concerned about changes to your nails. That’s a perfectly valid reason to come in. Can you describe what those changes are?
PATIENT: Changes... hmm. They're kinda... yellow-ish? And thicker, I think. Not like, really thick, but not like they used to be. I used to get manicures, but I stopped. A long time ago. I don't remember exactly when. Everything's a blur these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand. It's easy for time to slip away. And changes in nail color and thickness can be caused by a number of things. When did you first notice the yellowing and thickening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. A while. Probably... after I stopped the manicures? Maybe? I don’t… I don't keep track of things like that. It wasn't sudden, like bam yellow nails. It just…happened. I really can’t say for sure. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's okay, we’ll figure it out. It's not necessarily bad, but changes like this can indicate an underlying issue, which is why it's good you came in. Let's do a quick exam of your nails, and then I'll ask you a few more questions about your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know. Not that I remember what those things are... Be gentle, okay? My hands are sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be very gentle. Okay, I'm looking at your nails now. I see some yellow discoloration and a bit of thickening, as you mentioned. I don’t see any significant pitting or separation right now, which is good. It could be a fungal infection, which is fairly common, or it could be something else. Just to be thorough, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history and any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fungal? Like... athlete’s foot? I don’t have athlete’s foot. I think. Oh, wait, I did have something itchy on my feet a long time ago. But it went away. I used some powder. What kind of other symptoms? I don’t know. I just feel…old. Is that a symptom? I get tired a lot, but everyone gets tired, right? And my memory is… well, you see. I don't know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: You're right, athlete’s foot is one type of fungal infection, but it can affect nails as well. And it's good you mentioned the itchy feet, even if it resolved. We'll keep that in mind. "Feeling old" and fatigue are definitely things we should explore. When you say you get tired a lot, is it just general tiredness, or are you experiencing any specific symptoms with it?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Like what kinda specific? I just… feel drained, you know? Like my battery is always low. And it doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, or ten. I still wake up tired. And sometimes… sometimes my hands ache. Not all the time, just… randomly. Like when it rains. Is that weird? I don't know what’s normal anymore. I also get kinda…fuzzy headed. Like I'm walking through cotton.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. "Drained," waking up tired despite adequate sleep, hand aches that correlate with weather changes, and a "fuzzy headed" feeling – those are all things we need to consider. Now, I'm going to ask you some more general health questions, if that's alright. It will help me get a clearer picture of what might be going on. First, do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me think. I used to get hives when I was a kid, from… something. I don’t remember what. It was a long time ago. Now… I don’t think so. Unless… I get a little itchy sometimes after I use certain soaps. But it’s not a bad itch. Just annoying. Oh! And I can't take penicillin. I had a bad reaction to it, years ago. Almost died, the doctor said. I remember that much. Everything else… fuzz.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a penicillin allergy is important to note. And the hives as a child, and potential sensitivity to certain soaps, we'll keep that in the back of our minds as well. Next, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. Oh! I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I think. The doctor keeps changing it. I forget the name. And sometimes I take something for… for my stomach. When it bothers me. But not every day. Just when I eat something bad. Oh, and I take a calcium pill. My niece told me to. Said I needed it for my bones. That's it, I think. Everything is a blur. I used to have a whole cabinet full of pills, but I threw a lot of them out. Too much to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re currently taking medication for blood pressure, something as needed for your stomach, and a calcium supplement. It's alright that you don’t remember the names of everything, we can look those up in your records. Now, do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, or anything else that a doctor has diagnosed you with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The doctor said something about my cholesterol being high. A long time ago. And I think… I think he said my joints were… inflamed. Something about arthritis, maybe? But it wasn’t bad enough to do anything about it. Just said to watch it. And… and I used to get migraines. Really bad ones. But they stopped a long time ago. Now… I don’t know. Everything’s just… a mess up here. I just feel old and tired. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: "Feeling old and tired" isn't a condition in itself, but it's certainly something we need to investigate. High cholesterol and possible arthritis are also good to know. I'm going to check your electronic health record now to see what medications you've been prescribed and to get a more detailed history of your medical conditions. Okay, I see here that you were diagnosed with hyperlipidemia – that’s the high cholesterol – about five years ago and were prescribed a statin medication. It looks like you also have a history of osteoarthritis in your knees and hands, and you were prescribed a mild pain reliever for it. You also have a documented penicillin allergy. And it looks like you had migraines diagnosed about ten years ago. I see you were prescribed several medications for that, but haven’t refilled them in a few years. Does any of that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Hyper… what? Oh, cholesterol. Yeah, that sounds right. And the arthritis… my knees bother me sometimes, especially when it rains. Just like my hands. And the migraines… yeah, those were awful. I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. Worse than the headaches, sometimes. So, what does all this mean? Is something really wrong with me? I just thought my nails looked funny. Is this about my nails? I don't even remember asking about them.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and it’s good you’re remembering these things. Your nails are part of this, but your overall health picture is important too. The changes in your nails, combined with your fatigue, joint pain, and history of these other conditions, could be related. The yellowing and thickening of your nails could be a fungal infection, but it can also be caused by other things, like certain medical conditions or even just aging. Since you have a history of osteoarthritis and fatigue, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I want to check your thyroid function, your vitamin D levels, and your inflammatory markers to see if there's any underlying inflammation. I'll also do a nail culture to see if it's a fungal infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Oh, goodness. Okay, fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… don’t make me come back too often. My memory is… you know. I don’t want to forget why I’m even here. So, what do I have to do for these tests? Do I have to fast? Do I have to drink anything gross? I hate drinking anything gross.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make this as easy as possible for you. For the blood tests, you will need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks, except for water. The nail culture is simple - we'll just trim a small piece of your nail and send it to the lab. It doesn’t hurt at all. I'll give you a lab order and instructions when you leave. The lab will take care of the rest. It’s likely we’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or two to discuss the results. Is that manageable for you?
PATIENT: A week or two… I think so. As long as I write it down. Oh dear. I don’t have anything to write with. Do you have a pen? And maybe a little calendar thing? I'm terrible with dates. Just… help me remember, okay? I'm really starting to get confused. It’s just… everything’s a blur.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Here you go. I've written down your follow-up appointment for August 16th at 10:00 AM. I’ll also have the lab send a reminder text to your phone a few days beforehand, if you’d like. And if you're concerned about remembering anything, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Now, before you leave, I want to give you some general instructions. Try to get adequate rest, stay hydrated, and if you notice any changes in your symptoms, please call us right away. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Okay, August 16th. I’ll try to remember that. A text would be good, yes. Thank you. Um… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I'm just… confused. I think I just need a nap. And maybe some coffee. Is it okay if I just go now? I don't want to bother you anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. It was my pleasure, Ms. Thut. It’s perfectly alright to go and rest. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, coffee is a perfectly good idea. Have a good day, and we'll see you on August 16th. .
