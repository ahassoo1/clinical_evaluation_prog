DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your time is valuable. I have your lab results here from July 26th. Before we dive into those, just to ensure I have everything accurate, could you confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: November 12th, 1996. Honestly, I remember dates pretty easily, so don’t worry about checking anything too thoroughly. Just the results are what I need.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Kahrin. I appreciate that. Alright, looking at these results… your complete blood count is within normal limits. Your basic metabolic panel is also generally normal, with the exception of your Vitamin D level, which is quite low – at 18 ng/mL. It’s ideally above 30 ng/mL. Do you happen to know if you’ve had your Vitamin D checked before?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I don't usually bother with doctors unless something’s actually wrong. What does low Vitamin D even mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, many people don't realize they need it checked until symptoms arise. A low Vitamin D level can contribute to a variety of things – fatigue, muscle aches, even mood changes. It plays a role in bone health and immune function as well. It's not necessarily a crisis, but it's something we should address. Before we talk about treatment, could you tell me a little about your typical diet and how much time you spend outdoors in the sun?
PATIENT: Hmm. Diet… I eat okay, I guess. Lots of fish, when I can get it. I try to. Not a huge fan of red meat. And sun… not a ton. I work mostly indoors, and when I'm off, I’m usually… doing something else indoors. Honestly, I prefer it that way. I burn easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Fish is good, as it contains Vitamin D, but it sounds like you might not be getting enough sun exposure to adequately produce it yourself. Being fair-skinned and preferring indoor activities puts you at higher risk for deficiency. Do you currently take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been a big supplement person. I figure if I'm eating decently, I should be fine. Is this going to mean I have to start taking a bunch of pills now? Because that’s… not ideal.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It doesn't necessarily mean a “bunch” of pills. Often, a Vitamin D supplement is enough to get your levels back on track. We can discuss different options – dosage and whether you prefer a daily or weekly regimen. Before we decide on a plan, just to be thorough, have you experienced any muscle weakness, bone pain, or frequent illnesses recently?
PATIENT: Muscle weakness… sometimes, yeah, after a long day at work. But that’s just from lifting stuff, I always assumed. Bone pain, no. And illnesses… I get a cold now and then, like everyone else. Nothing major. I haven't really noticed anything different, honestly. Is this Vitamin D thing even causing any problems, or is it just a number on a paper?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question. Sometimes low Vitamin D doesn't cause noticeable symptoms, especially if it’s a mild deficiency. However, it can contribute to those subtle feelings of fatigue, or a lowered resistance to common illnesses. It’s also important for long-term bone health. Given your lifestyle and the result of 18 ng/mL, I recommend starting a Vitamin D supplement. I suggest 2000 IU daily. We can recheck your levels in three months to see how you're responding. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: 2000 IU… okay. Three months. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take forever. Is there anything else, or can I go now? I have a delivery schedule to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've just sent the prescription to your preferred pharmacy. It should be ready shortly. I'll also print out a handout with more information about Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation. No, I don't believe there is anything else at this time. Just monitor for any unusual symptoms and please do follow up in three months for a repeat blood test. If you experience any new or concerning symptoms before then, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s the handout. Thank you for coming in, Kahrin. And have a safe day with your deliveries.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. Alright, bye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Have a good day. .
