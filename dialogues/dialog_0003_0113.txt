DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yackey, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like I’m always going. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It’s a nuisance, really. My wife keeps saying I’m drinking too much tea, but… well, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. Frequent urination. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long? A while now. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. It’s hard to say, you know? Things… blur. Not like it happened suddenly, more like it just… crept up on me. I don’t keep track of these things. Is it important how long?
DOCTOR: It is, actually. It helps us narrow down the possibilities. Months, you say… and is it just frequency, or are you experiencing any urgency—a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Urgency… well, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. But yeah, occasionally I get that feeling. Like I have to go, right now. And then… well, then I do have to go. It’s not pleasant, let me tell you. Mostly at night, though. Waking me up. My wife isn't too happy about that, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent urination, particularly at night – nocturia, we call it – with occasional urgency. And are you noticing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little… discomfort, maybe. But not like a sharp pain, no. It’s just… a bit of a sting sometimes. Nothing I’d complain about, normally. Although, lately everything feels like a bit of a complaint, if I’m honest. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Doctor, I don't spend much time looking at my urine, if you don't mind me saying so. It looks… yellow. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker. Depends on how much water I’ve had, I reckon. Smell… well, it smells like urine. What am I supposed to be looking for? I’m a farmer, not a… a urine expert!
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I apologize. It’s just important to gather all the information. Let's move on then. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting? Hmm… sometimes. Not always, mind you. But occasionally it takes a moment. Just a little hesitation. Like it needs a bit of… encouragement. Nothing major, though. I don't spend a lot of time staring at the plumbing, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hesitation. And after you urinate, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or do you feel like some urine remains?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, actually. I… I don’t really pay attention. I go, and then I’m done. I don’t sit there and… measure things, you know? It feels empty enough, I suppose. I haven’t noticed any… dribbling or anything like that. Though, my wife might know better. She's the one who worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical examination, Mr. Segretto. I'll need to palpate your abdomen and perform a digital rectal exam. It will help me assess your prostate. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a what now? Palpate my… abdomen? And a… digital… exam? Doctor, are you sure that’s necessary? I’m not a young man, you know. This all seems a bit… invasive. I just came in because I’m going to the bathroom too much!
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Segretto. A digital rectal exam allows me to assess the size and condition of your prostate gland, which can often contribute to urinary issues, particularly in men your age. It's a quick examination, and it will provide valuable information. If you’d prefer, we can skip it, but it will limit my ability to determine the cause of your symptoms. Frankly, it's the most direct way to gather useful data.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If it’s necessary. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And be quick, please. I haven’t got all day. My wife will be expecting me back for tea. Though, she’ll probably just complain I’ve been drinking too much of it. Honestly, women.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up. I'll need to lubricate and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Let me know if you experience any significant discomfort.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright. Your prostate feels… enlarged. Not acutely concerning, but certainly contributing to your symptoms. I also palpated your abdomen, and did not note any significant abnormalities. I recommend a urinalysis to rule out any infection. And a PSA test—prostate-specific antigen—to further evaluate your prostate health. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
