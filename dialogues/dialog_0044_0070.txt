DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Asami, you say? Yes, good, good. I… moved here. New place. That’s why I am here. Medicare said I need to… check in. Social thing, I think. Not sick, you understand. Just… new. Old doctor… far away now.
DOCTOR: I see. A welcome check-up with a new physician, as requested by Medicare. That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. We want to make sure you’re all settled and have a good healthcare team here. So, even though you're not feeling actively sick, let's talk a bit about your overall health. It's helpful to have a baseline, you know?
PATIENT: Baseline? Like… a starting line? Okay. Fine. What do you need to know? I do makeup, you know. For the… the stage. Theater stuff. Been doing it a long time. Not important, I guess. But… I work with colors all day. Lots of colors.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly like a starting line, Mr. Szmyd. It helps us track any changes in your health over time. And your work is important! Knowing you work with colors all day is actually quite useful information. We'll come back to that, perhaps. First, let’s just go over some basics. Could you tell me a little about your overall health history?
PATIENT: History? Oh… like… bad things that happened? I… had the usual. Chickenpox when I was little. Nothing serious. Maybe a broken arm once, falling from a tree. A long time ago. I don't remember much. Divorced, you know. That was… history too, I suppose. Not a good one. Nothing important for you, Doctor. I am a healthy man. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. And thank you for sharing. When I say “history,” I'm mostly interested in any ongoing medical conditions you have – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, that sort of thing. Have you been diagnosed with anything like that?
PATIENT: High… what did you say? Pressure? The wife… she always said I worried too much. Maybe that was pressure? No, no doctor ever said anything about… pressure. Heart? A little fast sometimes. When I am excited. From the stage, you understand. Big performances. Not a problem, no. Just… excitement. I do not take pills. Never liked them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Cholesterol? Is that… like with the eggs? My wife, she liked eggs. Always said they were good for you. But she also said a lot of things. I eat eggs sometimes. Not every day. I do not know… what does it mean to have high… what did you say? Like pressure? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Mr. Szmyd, it’s perfectly alright if you don't know medical terms. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood. High cholesterol isn’t something you necessarily feel, but it can increase your risk of heart problems over time. It’s something we check with a blood test. Let’s put that aside for a moment. Have you ever had any serious surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. The tonsils, maybe? When I was a boy. Very small. Nothing important. And… the wife, she had a surgery once. Gallbladder, I think. But that was her. Not me. I mostly just… fix other people, you understand? With makeup. Not much happens to me. I'm a strong man. Mostly. A little tired, sometimes. But that’s… life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that's good to know. Let's talk about your family. Do you know if any of your close relatives – your parents, siblings, children – have had any serious health problems like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… Not much family left. Mother… she died a long time ago. Very old. I think it was… something with the heart. But I was young. I don’t remember details. Father… he left when I was a boy. Never saw him again. No siblings. No children. Just… me. I was always alone. Not important. We don't talk about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It’s alright if you don’t have much information. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a little. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never! Bad for the… for the face! The colors, you understand? It ruins everything. No, no smoke. And no… drinking, either. Not much. A little wine with dinner, sometimes. But not every day. Just… to relax. I need to be strong. For the stage. You understand. And for the colors. Is this important, Doctor? All these questions? I just came for the check-up. Medicare said so.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Szmyd, but don't worry, we're almost through. It all helps me get a complete picture of your health. Knowing about things like your habits is important. One last thing about your daily life. Now, you mentioned working with colors all day for the stage. What kind of colors are we talking about?
PATIENT: Ah! Colors! Yes, now we are talking! Everything. All of them! Bright reds, deep blues, shimmering golds… I create illusions, you understand? I transform people! It's… art! I use creams, powders, liquids… all sorts of things. And sometimes, they smell a little strong. Very strong. I have to be very close to their faces, all day. It’s very precise work, Doctor. Very precise. And… messy sometimes. But beautiful! You wouldn't believe the transformations!
DOCTOR: That sounds incredible, Mr. Szmyd. Truly fascinating work. And being so close to those colors and chemicals all day… that's actually quite helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline as we discussed. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You mean… touch me? I… don’t like being touched. Especially not by strangers. But… if Medicare says so… Fine. But be gentle. And quick. I have to get back to the stage. Very busy, you understand. Very important work. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. Completely understandable. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me. Alright. Blood pressure is 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are normal, but there is a slight wheeze in the lower lungs. Have you had any cough or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: Wheeze? I… I sometimes cough. Especially after the… the colors. The smell, you understand? It gets in my lungs. But it goes away. I don't pay much attention. It’s just… the job. I’ve been doing this for so long. A little cough is nothing. Nothing important. Is that all? Can I go now? I have to prepare the costumes. Very busy, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to check your reflexes quickly. And I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Reflexes are normal. Ears look clear. Throat is a little irritated, likely from the fumes you mentioned. And finally, I'll just feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, no significant tenderness. Okay, Mr. Szmyd, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re generally in good health, but there are a couple of things I'd like to investigate further. The slight wheezing in your lungs and the irritation in your throat could be related to the fumes you're exposed to at work. It's possible you have some mild occupational asthma or bronchitis.
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? What are you saying, Doctor? I’ve been doing this for years! Years! The fumes… everyone smells them. It’s part of the job! I can’t… I can’t stop doing my job. The costumes… the transformations… they need me. No. No asthma. No bronchitis. I’m fine. I just… cough a little. It’s nothing. Are you trying to tell me I can’t do my job anymore?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, not at all. I'm not saying you can't do your job. I'm just suggesting we investigate what might be causing the irritation in your lungs and throat. It’s better to be safe and find out, you know?
PATIENT: Fine. What do I have to do? But don’t make me spend all day in a hospital. I have to get back to the stage. Very busy, you understand. What kind of tests? Can it be quick? I don’t have time for… for long things. I need the colors. And the costumes. And can you write me a note for Medicare? Just to say I came. That's all. They want a note. Always with the notes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. We can certainly do this quickly. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, which is a simple breathing test to see how well your lungs are working. Both tests are relatively quick and painless. And yes, I’m happy to write a note for Medicare confirming your visit. I also recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you're doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks? That's… a long time. But… fine. If I have to. The tests… where do I go? Can I walk? I don't have a car. And… will it cost a lot of money? Medicare… they don’t always cover everything. And… can you give me something for the cough? Just something small. Something to help me breathe easier. The stage… they need me. And the colors. They're waiting.
DOCTOR: The X-ray and pulmonary function test are both done at the clinic across the street. It's a short walk, and they take Medicare, so there shouldn’t be any cost to you. I'll print out the orders now. As for the cough, I can prescribe a simple over-the-counter cough suppressant. It should help alleviate the irritation. It's not a long-term solution, but it will provide some relief in the meantime. Here's the prescription. And please, if the cough gets worse, or you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain, please come back immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. I have to go. The stage… they are waiting. And the colors… they need me. Thank you, Doctor. For the… tests. And the papers. But please… don’t worry too much. I’m a strong man. Mostly. And… make sure you write the note for Medicare. They are very strict.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. You take care of yourself. And I will certainly make sure to send that note to Medicare.
