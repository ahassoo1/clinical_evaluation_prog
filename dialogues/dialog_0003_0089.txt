DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you, I think. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. But I understand we’re discussing this… discomfort I’ve been having? Down low, mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, “discomfort.” Vague, but alright. Can you elaborate on this discomfort, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elaborate… That feels like a big word. Well, it’s… a pain, of course. A rather severe pain when it comes, but it doesn’t… stay. It comes and goes. Like waves, perhaps? Though not…pleasant waves. And it's… lower down, like you said. In my abdomen, I believe. Is that the right word? I do apologize for being so imprecise. It’s… difficult to pinpoint, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is…acceptable. And intermittent, you say?
PATIENT: Intermittent… yes, that sounds right. It doesn’t happen all the time. Just… episodes. Bad episodes, when they occur. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. I worry, naturally. Though, truthfully, I struggle to recall exactly when these episodes began. Everything feels… a bit hazy, these days. Is it alright if I take a moment? My mind is wandering.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, with all due respect, we have other patients. If you can't recall details, that's...unfortunate, but we need to proceed. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, of course. I apologize again. Change… Let me see. Not intentionally, no. I try to keep things… steady. Though, thinking about it… I did start a new type of herbal tea a few weeks ago. A friend recommended it, for… calming. But I can’t recall when exactly. And it’s not a strong tea, if that makes a difference. Mostly chamomile, I believe. Though I could be mistaken. And… Oh! I did have a small fall last month, but I didn't think it was serious. Just a little stumble. Nothing broken, I’m quite sure. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Chamomile…and a fall. Right. The fall…did you hit your abdomen during the fall, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a good question. I… don’t recall hitting it directly, no. I think I braced myself with my hands, mostly. And landed on my… side. It was a rather clumsy affair, if I’m honest. I do vaguely remember feeling a bit… bruised afterward, but it passed quickly. It wasn’t a hard fall, you see. Just a little wobble and then… down I went. Perhaps it wasn’t important? It felt… insignificant at the time.
DOCTOR: Insignificant details are often the most crucial, Ms. Glymph. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I have something called… SLE, I believe. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It's been… a companion for many years, now. Though, the specifics… escape me. I see a specialist, of course, but I rarely recall the details of the appointments. It involves… inflammation, I think. And… fatigue. It’s… a complicated thing, Doctor. I’m afraid I'm not very helpful with specifics. It's been a long time, and my memory… well, you’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: SLE. Right. And is this lupus currently under control?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a difficult question. I believe it is, yes. I take medication, regularly. Little pills, mostly. And I see my specialist every six months, as recommended. But… "control" feels like a strong word. There are good days, and… less good days. It fluctuates, you see. I feel… generally well, but there's always a background ache, a sort of… weariness. Is that helpful, Doctor? It's difficult to quantify, this… feeling. Perhaps my specialist would have a more precise answer?
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, I'm trying to ascertain your current condition, not obtain a referral to your specialist. Do you know what medications you’re taking for the lupus?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that is a difficult question. I… have a bag, at home, with all my medications. Little bottles, mostly. I take several, I believe. Plaquenil, perhaps? And… something for the pain. A small white pill, I think. It’s… all a bit of a blur, Doctor. I rely on my daughter to manage refills and such. She's very organized, thankfully. I truly apologize for being so… vague. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it alright if I… pause for a moment? My head feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, frankly, this is…unproductive. Let’s proceed with a basic abdominal examination. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to recall if you've experienced any recent changes in bowel habits, fever, or weight loss.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. An examination… Very well. Bowel habits… no, no significant changes that I recall. Everything’s been… regular, thankfully. Fever… I haven’t felt feverish, no. And weight loss… I’m not sure. I haven’t weighed myself recently. I tend to… fluctuate a little, depending on how I’m feeling. Is it alright if I… adjust my position? This gown feels a bit… drafty.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm palpating your abdomen now. Do you feel any tenderness in these areas?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little… there. Yes, that’s… a bit tender. Not excruciating, but… uncomfortable. And perhaps… a little here, too. It’s… hard to pinpoint, exactly. It’s more of a… dull ache, than a sharp pain. And it seems to… come and go, even as you press. Is that… normal, Doctor? It’s rather confusing, this… sensation.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm detecting some mild tenderness in both lower quadrants, with slightly more pronounced discomfort on the left. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some subjective discomfort. Given your history of SLE and the intermittent nature of the pain, and the fact that it comes and goes, and the tenderness, this could be a flare of your lupus. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And a urinalysis. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Glymph.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, urinalysis… Very well. Is it… a lot of blood? I’m not terribly fond of needles, you see. And… a comprehensive metabolic panel? That sounds rather… thorough. But if it’s necessary to rule things out, then I suppose I trust your judgment, Doctor. I do appreciate you taking the time to… investigate this, even if I’m not particularly helpful with the details. Perhaps the tests will shed some light on the matter?
DOCTOR: It's a standard amount of blood, Ms. Glymph. A few vials. And the urinalysis is…a simple sample. We'll have the results back within a few days. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, you should go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. A few vials of blood, a simple sample… Very well. And worsening pain, fever, nausea… the emergency room. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I will… try to remember all of that. It’s… a lot of information, you see. Perhaps my daughter could accompany me to the follow-up appointment? She's very good at… details. And… I suppose that’s all for today? I do appreciate your patience with my… vagueness.
DOCTOR: That would be advisable, Ms. Glymph. I've sent the lab orders to the front desk. They will provide you with the necessary instructions. Yes, that’s all for today. Try to rest, and avoid any strenuous activity. And please, try to recall any specific details regarding your symptoms before your follow-up appointment. It would be… helpful. Goodbye, Ms. Glymph.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will certainly try. And thank you again for your patience. I do appreciate it. Goodbye. .
