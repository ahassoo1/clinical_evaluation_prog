DOCTOR: Right. Well, Velda Squiers, 45 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m here… well, I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor. Just a general check, really, to say I'm fit to travel. Nothing serious, I assure you. It’s just paperwork, I believe.
DOCTOR: Paperwork, yes. Cruise lines. Always something. Alright. "Fit to travel" is what they call it. Still, we need to be thorough. A basic check-up is fine, but I need to ask a few questions first. It's standard procedure, you understand. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thorough is good. Let me think… Well, my husband, bless him, he had high blood pressure, but I never did. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago, back in… oh, goodness, 1998, I think it was. They took it out, and I’ve been perfectly fine ever since. Apart from that… no, nothing I can recall. I’ve always been quite healthy, touch wood.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal in '98… alright. And no other significant medical problems since then?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just the usual… colds and flu, you know. Nothing that needed a doctor, really. I took to bed with a hot lemon and honey and got over them just fine. I’m not one for complaining, Doctor. I believe fresh air and a good diet do wonders.
DOCTOR: Right. And any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing else. I did have my tonsils out when I was a wee girl, but that was… oh, a very long time ago. Before I started school, I think. It wouldn't be significant now, would it?
DOCTOR: No, not particularly. Alright. How about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t take a single thing. Not even a vitamin. My husband always said I was stubborn about pills. He used to try to get me to take something for my joints, but I wouldn’t have it. Fresh air and walking, that’s what I believe in.
DOCTOR: And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I like cats, and I've never had a problem with them. Dust doesn’t bother me, and I’ve eaten shellfish all my life. I suppose I’m rather lucky, really. No, I can’t recall being allergic to anything. Is that unusual, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Unusual isn't the right word. Infrequent, perhaps. Alright. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother, bless her soul, she had arthritis quite badly in her later years. That’s why she was always encouraging my husband to get me to take something for my joints! And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He didn’t live to a very old age, sadly. I suppose those are the main things. Nothing else springs to mind.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and a cardiac history. And what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Oh, dear. What do you mean? I enjoy a good book and a nice walk. I go to church most Sundays. Do you mean… drinking or smoking, Doctor? Because I don't do either. Never have. I find them quite unpleasant, actually.
DOCTOR: I was asking about alcohol consumption and tobacco use, yes. But also, your diet, exercise routine… general lifestyle. You mentioned walking, which is good. But how often, and for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, I see! My apologies, Doctor. I sometimes miss these things. Well, I try to walk every day, if the weather allows. Usually for about an hour, around the village. I enjoy a good potter around the shops, too, that counts as exercise, doesn't it? As for diet… I eat sensible things. Lots of fish, plenty of vegetables, not too much red meat. I do enjoy a wee biscuit with my tea, but I try not to overdo it. I bake them myself, you see, so I know what goes into them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Could you please sit up straight on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to. Whatever you need. I do hope I'm not taking up too much of your time. I know you must be very busy.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly… brisk. Blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, lungs… Take a deep breath… and exhale. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear. No obvious signs of infection. Alright. Everything seems… acceptable, at first glance.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, Doctor. "Acceptable" is very reassuring! I'm glad everything seems alright. Is there anything else you need to check? Perhaps my knees? They do creak a bit in the cold weather, though I manage perfectly well.
DOCTOR: We could do a quick musculoskeletal assessment, if you insist. But frankly, you've already described the creaking. Some crepitus, as expected. Range of motion is… adequate. No significant swelling or tenderness. Overall, I wouldn’t say it requires further investigation at this time. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend you monitor it at home. And try to incorporate a little more regular exercise, if possible. Not just walking, but something more… vigorous. It's about preventative care, you see. Maintaining your health for the cruise and beyond.
PATIENT: Oh, I quite agree, Doctor. Preventative care is very important. I shall certainly monitor my blood pressure. And I shall see if I can find a gentle exercise class at the village hall. Perhaps something with music? That might make it more enjoyable. So, does that mean you'll be able to fill out the form for the cruise line? That's really all I need.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. The form. I'll document my findings – regular heart sounds, clear lungs, slightly elevated blood pressure, musculoskeletal assessment within normal limits. And I'll state that you are medically fit to travel, with the caveat that you continue to monitor your blood pressure and maintain a reasonable level of physical activity. Do not ignore any concerning symptoms while on the cruise. Chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache… seek immediate medical attention. Here you go. Consider this your official clearance. And try to enjoy your cruise. But don’t overdo it.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor! You've put my mind completely at ease. I certainly won't ignore any symptoms, and I promise to take it easy. I'm looking forward to a lovely, relaxing time. I really appreciate your time and your thoroughness. Is there anything else I need to do, or any payment I need to make?
DOCTOR: The fee is £85, please. And no, that will be all. Try not to get seasick. It’s a bother for everyone. The receptionist will take care of the payment. And please, do take care of yourself. Cruises are pleasant, but they can be… disruptive to one’s routine.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. £85, of course. I shall certainly try to avoid seasickness, and I appreciate your advice about my routine. I do like a bit of order, you see. Thank you again for everything. Have a lovely afternoon.
DOCTOR: You too. .
