DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Shanor is name. Referee... fitness check. Need for work. Quick, if can be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. A fitness check for your work as a referee, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Important. I… run a lot. Blow whistle. Sometimes… need jump. Not so high now. Old. Thirty-one, but… feel older. Work is… hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're being proactive about this. Thirty-one is certainly not old! We'll get a good sense of where things stand. Just to clarify, when you say you “need jump,” is that for reaching high balls, or is there another aspect of your refereeing that requires jumping?
PATIENT: Balls, yes. Basketball. Sometimes very high. Other times… just quick move to side. Need fast. Feel slow sometimes. Also… wife… she… passed. Not so strong now. Sorry. This… make hard.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor. That must be incredibly difficult. It's perfectly understandable that you're not feeling your strongest right now. Grief can absolutely affect everything, physically and emotionally. Let's focus on the physical aspects today, but please know I'm here to listen if you want to talk more about that as well. You mentioned feeling slow and needing to jump for basketball. Is this a recent change, or has this been building up over time?
PATIENT: Building up. Maybe… six months. Before… more strong. Jump higher. Run faster. Now… harder. Need breath. Sometimes… pain in leg. Not always. When run too much. Sorry, I… not good explain.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. You're explaining very well. It sounds like this has been a gradual change over the last six months. The pain in your leg… could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Like… pull. Inside leg. Not sharp. Dull. After run… more bad. Rest… better. But… always there a little. Also… sometimes feel tight. Like… muscle too hard. Sorry. I… just work. Hard work. No time for… doctor before.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's a persistent discomfort, especially after exertion. That's helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Shanor, let's do a quick examination of your leg. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Table… here? No problem. Quick is good. I have… work later.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one. And we’ll try to be as quick as possible. First, I’m just going to feel around to check for any tenderness. Then I’ll have you do a few simple movements so I can see how your leg is working. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Feel… and move. Yes. Quick is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Shanor. I'm just feeling along your leg now. Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Yes. There. Little pain when you… push. Not much. But… feel it. Like… pulled. Before… no pain there. Now… always a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. And what about when you bend your leg like this?
PATIENT: More pain. Not so much, but… feel it. Like… stretch too far. Tight. Like… muscle say “stop”.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Shanor. That gives me a better understanding of what's going on. Your reflexes and strength seem good, which is reassuring. It sounds like you may have a hamstring strain, possibly a mild one. It’s not severe, but it explains the pain and tightness you’re experiencing. It’s important we don’t push it too hard. Do you recall any specific incident where you might have injured it, like a sudden movement or overexertion?
PATIENT: No. Not one thing. Just… work. Every game. Run, jump, whistle. Maybe… slowly. Not one big thing. Just… slowly get bad. Wife… she… always say “slow down”.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it developed gradually over time with the demands of your work. Your wife sounds like a very wise woman. It’s good you’re listening to your body now. So, based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it seems likely this is a mild hamstring strain. We’ll want to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. I’d like to order a simple X-ray of your leg to make sure there isn’t a fracture or any other bone issue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… okay. If need. Quick, if can be? Work… need. But… safe first. Wife… always say “safe”.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Safety first, and I agree with your wife. We’ll do the X-ray quickly. And while we’re waiting for the results, I’d like to recommend a few things to help with the pain and prevent it from getting worse. I’m going to have the nurse bring in a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with the swelling and discomfort. We’ll also do some gentle stretching exercises at home, and I’ll show you how to properly warm up before games. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes. Medicine… good. Stretch… okay. Nurse… show me? I… not good remember. Wife… she… always help me stretch. Quick is good. Work… wait.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse will go over everything very carefully with you, and we'll make sure you have a handout with the exercises so you don't have to remember everything at once. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or two to see how you're progressing. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse, or you experience any numbness or tingling in your leg, please don't hesitate to come back or call the clinic right away. Does that all sound alright, Mr. Shanor?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Nurse… good. Follow up… okay. No numb… good. Work… wait. Thank you, Doctor. Quick… you very quick.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in now with the prescription and schedule your follow-up appointment. And please, take it easy. Your health is the most important thing. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. .
