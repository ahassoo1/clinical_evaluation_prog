DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just… tired. Real tired. And I eat dirt. Not like… on purpose, but I need it. It's stupid, I know. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: “Tired,” alright. And… you need to eat dirt?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Clay, mostly. Red clay. Don’t look at me like that. It makes… something feel better. I don't know what it makes better, okay? It just… does. It started a while ago, I guess. I don't really keep track of dates. Just getting worse lately, that’s all. And the tired… it’s not just regular tired. It’s… heavy. Like I’m carrying rocks.
DOCTOR: Heavy, you say. And how long has this been going on, this… need to consume clay?
PATIENT: Honestly? A long time. Years, probably. Maybe since… after my husband passed. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little bit, and sometimes… well, sometimes I really crave it. I just… deal with it. Never thought it was anything to deal with, really. It's just… weird. Can we just skip the whole life story? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Skip the life story?
PATIENT: Well, yeah! What does my husband have to do with me eating dirt? It's not like it's connected! Look, I told you I've been tired and I eat clay. Is there a pill for that? I'm not one for… talking about feelings. It won’t help. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm here. Someone told me I should get checked out, something about iron or something. It sounded ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Iron is relevant, actually. And it's not always about "feelings," Ms. Cantoran, though we do need to understand why you’re experiencing these urges. It's called pica, the compulsion to eat non-nutritive substances. Often, it indicates a deficiency. But we need to rule out other things first. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Pica? Sounds fancy. Look, I eat clay. That's it. No weird cravings for paper or anything. Just… clay. Red clay. And I'm tired. Really, really tired. Can we please just get a blood test or something? I don’t like this. It feels… intrusive. And I haven't eaten anything else strange, no. Just the dirt. It's not like I'm enjoying it! It just… helps. A little. Sometimes. Now, can we please move things along?
DOCTOR: Alright, a blood test we can do. We’ll check your iron levels, complete blood count, and a few other things just to get a baseline. But I still need a bit more information. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, headaches, yes. All the time. But who doesn't get headaches? It’s a busy life. Shortness of breath… sometimes, when I walk up the stairs. But I’m not exactly a spring chicken, you know? I’m not falling over or anything. Look, I work with computers all day, I sit a lot. Maybe it’s just… old age. Can we just get this over with? I have deadlines. And I really don't like being poked and prodded. Are we doing the blood test now?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get that blood work ordered. And yes, we will do a brief physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check a few basic things. It won't be extensive. We need to rule out anything serious causing the shortness of breath and fatigue. Please sit back and relax. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Relax? Relax? I'm telling you I eat dirt and I'm exhausted, and you want me to relax? Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. Deep breaths. Hmph. There. Happy? Let's just get this done. I have things to do. Important things. Not… talking about dirt.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Hmm. Your breathing sounds a little… congested. Do you have a cough?
PATIENT: A cough? Sometimes. Just a little tickle in my throat. Nothing major. It comes and goes, like everything else. It's the dry air, probably. Or dust from the computer parts. I don't know. It’s not like it keeps me up at night. Just a little cough. I've had it for ages. Really, is this important? It feels like you're looking for something that isn't there. Can we just skip to the results of the blood test? I really don't like all this… poking and listening. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's important to rule things out, Ms. Cantoran. A cough, congestion, fatigue… these can all point to underlying issues. Okay, heart sounds are… a little rapid, but nothing immediately alarming. Now, let's check your extremities for any signs of anemia. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Extremities? What does my arms have to do with anything? Look, I eat dirt, I’m tired, and I have a little cough. It’s not rocket science. My husband always said I worried too much about nothing. And he was usually right. Just get it over with. I have deadlines. And honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time. I'm probably just stressed. Is that it? Can we just say I'm stressed and send me home?
DOCTOR: Capillary refill is a little slow… and your hands are quite pale. That could indicate anemia, which can be caused by nutritional deficiencies. We’ll know more once the blood work comes back. I am going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. I’ll also need to ask about your diet. What do you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Now you're asking about my food? Look, I eat. Sandwiches, sometimes. Soup. Whatever’s quick. I don't have time to make fancy meals. I don't really pay attention to what I'm eating, okay? I work long hours. Just… normal food. Not a lot of red meat, I guess. I don’t like it much. And honestly, I don't eat a lot of vegetables. Too much trouble. Is that what you want to know? Just… simple food. Quick and easy. Now can we please finish this? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab results should be available in about 24-48 hours. Once I have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you try to incorporate more iron-rich foods into your diet. Leafy green vegetables, beans, fortified cereals… things like that. And, Ms. Cantoran, I do need to ask… have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes in my bowel movements?! Are you serious? You’re asking me about… that? Look, I’m telling you, I eat dirt. That’s the important part. You’re more concerned about my… business? This is ridiculous. Honestly, I’ve never had anyone ask me about… that. And I don’t appreciate it. No, I haven't noticed any changes. They're... normal. Can we just stop? This is a complete waste of my time and frankly, it’s a bit… offensive. Just tell me the results of the blood test and let me go. I have a life, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. It may seem unrelated, but changes in bowel habits can sometimes be associated with pica or underlying malabsorption issues. However, if you’re uncomfortable discussing it, we can move on. I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab will contact you to schedule a time to draw the samples. Once I have the results, I will call you to discuss them. In the meantime, if your fatigue worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office.
PATIENT: Finally. Fine. I’ll contact you if I… fall over. Thanks for nothing. .
