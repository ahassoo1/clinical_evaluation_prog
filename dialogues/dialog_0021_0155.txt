DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, well, the shaking, mostly. It's in my hands. Been gettin' worse, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Time... slips away, you know? It’s just… bothersome. I try not to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Shaking, you say. And it's primarily in your hands?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Though sometimes... I think it’s in my leg too. Hard to tell. I used to work with a lot of machinery, you see. Water pumps, big ones. Maybe it’s from that? Old injuries, perhaps. It’s hard to say. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Machinery… Well, we'll try to figure it out. When you say it's been getting worse, can you describe how it’s worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How… Let me think. It used to just be when I was… still, you know? Like when I was tryin’ to eat soup. Now… now it happens even when I'm walkin'. Not all the time, but… more often. And it’s… harder to control. I dropped a plate last week. Haven’t broken a plate in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's progressing – happening more frequently and now interfering with things like walking and eating. And it’s harder to control. Have you noticed anything else along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Sometimes my hand feels kinda… numb. Not always, just now and then. And I’ve been… forgetful. Worse than usual, even for an old man like me. I keep misplacin’ things. Keys, mostly. And… and names. Faces, too. It’s… frustrating. My daughter keeps tellin’ me I need to write things down.
DOCTOR: Numbness in the hand… and increased forgetfulness. Right. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. I went to the doctor a lot when I was younger, always catchin’ colds or somethin’. But… significant? Not that I recall. I had a bad back for years from liftin’ things at the plant, that’s about it. And… my blood pressure was a bit high, I think. They gave me some pills for it, years ago. Stopped takin’ them eventually. Didn’t see much point, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in the past… any surgeries or hospital stays that you remember?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never liked the idea much. And no hospital stays, not unless you count when my tonsils came out when I was a boy. That was… ages ago. Everything’s a bit hazy, you know? I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My wife, she… she passed away some years back. Divorced before that, actually. Daughter, she lives in the city. Good girl, visits when she can. As for… illnesses in the family… my father, he had some trouble with his heart, I think. And my mother… she just… got old. Nothing specific I can recall, really. Lots of aches and pains, like most folks.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. Stopped the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. Don’t much believe in takin’ pills unless I absolutely have to. My daughter keeps tryin’ to get me to take somethin’ for my memory, but I refuse.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and strength. That alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, of course. Do what you need to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have… appointments. And I get a bit impatient, you see. Not that I mean any disrespect. Just… old habits.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. If you’ll just sit here for me. Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Just relax your arm… good. And now the other one… Hmm. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I’m tryin’. Arthritis, you see. Gets worse with the weather. Makes things a bit difficult. And… my hands are shaky, remember? It’s hard to get a good grip.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do remember. And now, can you lift your arms for me?
PATIENT: Yes… Here. It’s… a little stiff, you see? Been workin’ in the garden, pullin’ weeds. Probably just pulled a muscle. Old age, you know. Everything aches.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, let’s look at your hands. Can you tap your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. It’s… harder than it looks, you see? The shaking… it throws me off. And my eyes aren’t what they used to be. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. That’s quite enough for now. I’ve seen enough to be concerned. It’s difficult to say exactly what’s going on, but the combination of shaking, weakness, and coordination issues… it warrants further investigation. There are a number of possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, but it could also be something more serious.
PATIENT: Oh… serious? What do you mean? Like… what possibilities? I don't like the sound of that, not one bit. Just aches and pains, I thought.
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a tremor, which is common, especially with age. But the weakness and difficulty with coordination suggest other things we need to rule out. Things like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, or even a stroke, though I’m not saying it is any of those things. We need to get some tests done to be sure.
PATIENT: Parkinson's? A stroke? Oh dear… my wife… she had a stroke. It wasn't pretty. I… I don’t want that. What kind of tests? Will they be… painful? I don't do well with needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’re just gathering information at this point. The tests aren’t usually painful. We’ll start with a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And then, I’d like you to have an MRI of your brain. It’s a scan that takes detailed pictures, and it will help us see what’s going on inside your head.
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. I'm not insured, you see. I haven’t been able to afford it since… well, since my wife got sick. Is it really necessary? Can’t we just… try some pills or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns about the cost. And I wish there was a simpler way. But because of the combination of symptoms you’re experiencing - the shaking, weakness, coordination issues, and forgetfulness - an MRI is crucial to rule out serious causes. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your brain. I can connect you with resources that may help with the cost. There are programs available for uninsured patients. We’ll explore all options. But ignoring this could have serious consequences. We need to know what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: I… I suppose you’re right. It’s just… a lot to take in. Another test, another bill… I just want to be able to garden again, you know? And remember my daughter’s name without having to ask. Alright. Do what you need to do. Connect me with those programs. And… please, just try to be quick.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood test and the MRI for you. She’ll also provide you with information on the financial assistance programs. We’ll get you in as quickly as possible. Here’s the referral form for the MRI center and the list of programs. Please call them as soon as possible to schedule an appointment. And I’ll also write you a prescription for a referral to a neurologist. They're the specialists in conditions affecting the brain and nerves. They'll be able to interpret the test results and recommend the best course of treatment. We'll get through this, Mr. Jezik. We’ll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me right now?
