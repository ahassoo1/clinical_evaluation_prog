DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's about my blood. I need to know what type it is. My daughter… she said something about needing it for… something. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s important, though. She was very insistent.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood type. Well, that's… not a typical reason for a visit to Internal Medicine, but alright. It's good to be prepared, I suppose. It's not usually something we proactively determine unless there's a medical need – like before a surgery, or if you're experiencing certain health issues. Have you ever had your blood type checked before, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I really don’t remember. I’ve had… lots of doctors over the years, you see. And lots of little tests. I used to work… on the ships, rigging. Lots of bumps and scrapes, and they’d patch me up. But I don’t recall anyone telling me my blood type. It was a long time ago, mostly. Perhaps they did, but I simply don’t remember. Is it… common knowledge, then? Do people just… know?
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Nini, it’s not “common knowledge.” People don’t just know their blood type. It’s something you have to be tested for. And frankly, unless there was a specific reason – a transfusion, a major surgery, something like that – most people don't bother finding out. Your daughter is right to be cautious, though. Knowing your blood type can be useful in an emergency. Let's get a quick blood draw done, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's best. A blood draw… yes, that sounds sensible. I don't mind a little prick. I’ve had worse, working the ropes, honestly. Will it take long? I have a little… appointment later this afternoon. Nothing important, but… well, you understand. Old lady things.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take long at all, Mrs. Nini. Just a few minutes for the draw itself, and then about ten to fifteen minutes while we run the test. The lab is right down the hall. I'll have Nurse Ramirez come in and get you set up. While we wait for the results, perhaps you could tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, my overall health… well, I’m 79, you see. Things creak a bit. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I get a little… breathless sometimes. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. I used to be very strong, though. All that rigging, hauling ropes… kept me fit as a fiddle. Now… well, now I mostly sit and knit. And drink tea. Lots and lots of tea. Do you need to know about any… medicines? I have a small bottle for my… water retention. The doctor down at the clinic gave it to me. I can’t quite recall the name, though. It's a little white bottle.
DOCTOR: Right. A little white bottle. That’s… helpful. Mrs. Nini, it's important for me to know exactly what medications you’re taking. Do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't, dear. I left it at home. I didn't think… well, I didn't think it was important enough to bring. It's just a little thing for… swelling. My daughter always tells me to write things down, but… honestly, I just can’t keep track of it all anymore. I'm sorry. It's probably Furosemide. Or something like that. That sounds right, doesn't it? She mentioned something about water pills once. Is that important? Will it affect the blood test?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, “something like that” is not a medication name. Furosemide is a diuretic, a water pill, and yes, it absolutely can affect the results of certain blood tests. It can alter your electrolyte levels, which is why it's vital for me to have an accurate record of everything you’re taking. I need to know the dosage as well. Do you remember how much you take?
PATIENT: Oh dear, you’re making me nervous now, Doctor. I just take one… a little white pill, like I said. Once a day, usually in the morning. Sometimes I forget, and take it at lunchtime. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the numbers. My daughter… she handles all that. She's very organized. I really should write it down, I know. I just… it all feels like such a bother. Will it ruin the test, then? Do we have to start over? I really need to know my blood type, you see. She's worried about… something.
DOCTOR: No, we won’t have to “start over,” but the results will need to be interpreted with caution. The diuretic can skew the readings. It's not ideal, Mrs. Nini, and frankly, it highlights the importance of maintaining an accurate medication list. I’m going to proceed with the blood draw, but I will likely need to order some additional tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. And I strongly recommend you bring in all your medications, with the dosages clearly marked, for your next appointment. Nurse Ramirez will be in shortly to draw the blood. In the meantime, can you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not to anything food-wise, no. I eat everything, thankfully. My mother always said a good appetite was a blessing. I think I was allergic to… penicillin, when I was a girl. But that was a long time ago. They gave me a funny rash. I haven't had it in… well, decades. And… oh, yes! Bees. I’m dreadfully allergic to bees. One stung me on the hand a few years back, and it swelled up something awful. My daughter had to give me a shot. That was… unpleasant. Is that all you need to know? I hope this isn’t too much trouble. I feel like I’m failing some sort of test.
DOCTOR: Penicillin and bees. Alright, that’s good to know. It's important to be aware of those. Nurse Ramirez should be here any moment. She will explain the procedure. I want to reiterate, Mrs. Nini, the accuracy of your medical history is crucial. If you're unsure about anything, please ask. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… goodness. My mother lived to be 95, very strong woman, she was. She always said a little sherry a day kept the doctor away. She didn't have any… serious illnesses, as far as I know. My father… he was a sailor, mostly away at sea. I don't recall him being ill, either. But my uncle… on my mother's side, he had something with his heart. A weakness, they called it. He died when he was quite young, though. Perhaps 60. And… oh, my sister, she had… cancer, I think. A long time ago. It was… very sad. I don't recall what kind. Everything feels so hazy, you see. It was before your time, I'm sure. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart condition in your uncle, cancer in your sister. That's… something to consider. Nurse Ramirez is here now. She’ll get you set up for the blood draw. She will ask you a few questions to confirm some details. After that, we'll wait for the results. I may want to discuss a referral to a cardiologist, given your uncle’s history. But let’s see what the initial blood work shows first. Nurse Ramirez, could you please take Mrs. Nini to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A cardiologist… goodness. Well, I suppose it’s best to be careful. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, dear. I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have my knitting, you see. And my tea gets cold.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Nini. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible.
