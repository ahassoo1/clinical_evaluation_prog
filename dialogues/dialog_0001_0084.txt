DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler, have a seat. Look, I'm a busy man, so let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well… it’s been… difficult to say exactly. I’ve been feeling rather… short of breath. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been happening for a little while now, I believe. I… don’t recall precisely when it started, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Right. "A little while." That's...helpful. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever… I… I don’t think so? I haven’t been checking my temperature, if that makes sense. I don't usually run a fever… or, I don’t remember ever running one, at least. Is that important, Doctor? Perhaps I should have been… more diligent.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know if you're burning up, yes. Okay. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really pain, exactly. More… a tightness, sometimes. Like… a band around my chest, but not a hurtful band. It comes and goes. It doesn't keep me up at night, if that helps. It's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how's your energy level?
PATIENT: My energy… lower than it used to be, I suppose. I find myself… needing to rest more often. Not exhausted, exactly, but… easily tired. I used to be able to work for hours on my writing, and now… I need to take breaks frequently. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Writing," huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I’m an author. Or, I was actively writing. It’s been difficult to concentrate lately, with everything going on. I apologize if that seems… unimportant. Is that relevant to my breathing, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. Any cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No cough. That’s one thing I haven’t experienced. Just the shortness of breath and the dryness. It’s very… unsettling. It feels like my mouth and eyes are constantly filled with sand. Is there… anything I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't believe so. I've never been formally diagnosed with any. I haven't had any… bad reactions to anything I can recall. Though, living where I do… the pollen can be quite strong in the summer. But I don’t think that’s it. It feels… different than seasonal allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a complicated question, Doctor. I take a few things… for… anxiety. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped a while ago. My previous doctor took me off of it. I… I can’t quite remember the names, unfortunately. It was a long time ago, and I don’t… keep very good track of these things. I do have private insurance, though, so there's a record somewhere, I assume. Would that help?
DOCTOR: So, you're on something for anxiety, stopped something for blood pressure...and can't remember what either one is?
PATIENT: I understand that's… not ideal, Doctor. It’s just… things have been a bit chaotic lately. And my memory hasn’t been the best. I apologize for the inconvenience. Perhaps my insurance company can provide the details? I truly don't recall the names. It was a while ago, and I wasn't feeling myself then, either. I just want to feel better. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Let's just see what the records say… Alright. Okay. You were on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, discontinued six months ago, and…escitalopram for anxiety. Still taking that, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s it! Escitalopram. Thank you. Yes, I am still taking that. Every day. That explains… why I couldn't remember the other one. It’s the anxiety medication that makes it difficult to recall things sometimes. I am very glad you found that information. Is that… relevant to my breathing, perhaps?
DOCTOR: It could be. Alright. I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out. Lungs are clear, but a little quiet. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. 96%. That’s acceptable. Still… the shortness of breath is concerning. I’m going to order a chest x-ray just to rule things out.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. A chest x-ray sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on. I just… want to breathe normally again. Will that take long? And… will I get the results quickly?
DOCTOR: The x-ray shouldn’t take long. We have a technician available now. Results usually take a couple of hours. In the meantime, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Just to have a baseline. And… I recommend you follow up with a cardiologist. Just to be safe. It's probably nothing, but we need to rule out anything serious. I'll have the nurse schedule that for you. Any questions?
PATIENT: A cardiologist…? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it something you suspect? I understand you want to be thorough, but… is my breathing that concerning? And the blood work… will those tests take long as well? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I get anxious easily, as you know. I want to be prepared. .
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Kobler, it’s better to be safe than sorry. A cardiologist isn't an emergency. It's a precaution. The blood work should be back within 24 hours. The x-ray will be quicker. I'm ordering these tests to eliminate possibilities, not because I think you're on death's door. Now, the nurse will come in and draw your blood, and she'll escort you to radiology for the x-ray. Do you have any other… concerns before I let you get on with it?
