DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Erxleben. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well, I’ve been… rather excessively thirsty lately, and hungry too. It’s a bit unusual, to be honest. I’m not sure what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased thirst and hunger can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s probably been… oh, about a month now, I’d say. Maybe a bit longer. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. At first, I just thought I was drinking less water than usual, but then I started noticing I was always wanting a drink. And the hunger… it’s not like a normal craving, it’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over a month. That’s helpful. And you describe it as constant hunger, not necessarily related to meals?
PATIENT: Precisely. I eat a perfectly normal-sized dinner, and an hour later… I feel like I could eat another one. It’s… frustrating, to be frank. And it’s not specific foods, either. Doesn’t matter what it is, I just… want to eat something.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant hunger despite normal meals is certainly something we need to investigate. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… let me see. I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more often, I suppose. Though I thought that was just… well, you know. Getting older. And I feel a little more tired than usual, but again, that could be anything, really. I haven’t really noticed anything major, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Increased urination and fatigue alongside the thirst and hunger are worth noting. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Right. Well, nothing too serious, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and broke my arm a few years back, but that’s about it. No chronic conditions, no regular medications, nothing like that. I’ve always been generally healthy. Divorced about five years ago, which was stressful, but that’s… not medical, is it? And I have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No chronic conditions or regular medications is helpful. And thank you for mentioning the appendectomy. Stress can certainly play a role in health, but for now, we’ll focus on the physical symptoms. Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had some sort of ailment with his kidneys, I vaguely recall. But no diabetes, not that I’m aware of. They weren’t big on talking about health issues, to be honest. It was… a different generation. I don't really know much beyond that, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, that’s helpful. We can work with what you know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked, very rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on Christmas, that’s about it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I work in shipping and receiving, so I need to be clear-headed. It’s… rather important for the job. I try to eat reasonably well, though it’s been difficult with this constant hunger, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption, and a generally healthy diet, despite the recent changes. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years, and haven't had any problems with those. I think I might be a little sensitive to strong perfumes, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? More of an annoyance, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. It'll just involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I understand. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I suppose a quick check is a good idea. Please proceed. I am a bit anxious, but I'll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 88. A bit elevated, but not dramatically so. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness to palpation. No masses felt. I do note a slightly enlarged abdomen, though not significantly. Alright. Based on this initial examination, along with the symptoms you've described, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us determine if there's an underlying cause for your increased thirst, hunger, and fatigue. Specifically, I want to check your blood glucose levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend to figure out what’s going on. Blood glucose levels and kidney function… is that what you suspected? I don’t mind if you tell me if you have a preliminary idea. I’d rather be prepared.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Erxleben, based on your symptoms – the increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, and fatigue – diabetes is certainly a possibility that we need to rule out. The blood glucose test will give us a definitive answer. We’ll also check your kidney function to ensure everything is working as it should, as kidney problems can sometimes cause similar symptoms. The complete blood count will help us to assess your overall health and look for any other underlying issues. It's important not to jump to conclusions, but it’s best to be thorough. We’ll get the results back within a couple of days, and I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to drink plenty of water and try to eat a balanced diet, even with your increased appetite. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. Diabetes… it’s a bit worrying, if I’m honest. But I appreciate you being upfront. A couple of days… alright. I’ll try to be patient. And yes, I will drink plenty of water. So, where do I go for the blood work? Is there a lab I should use? And… is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Fasting, or anything like that? I want to make sure I do it correctly.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Yes, for the most accurate results, we will need a fasting blood glucose test. That means you should not eat or drink anything – except water – for at least 8 hours before your appointment. Here is a requisition form for the lab at City General Hospital. They’re located at 123 Main Street. Their phone number is 555-1234. You can walk in during their business hours, which are 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday. It’s always a good idea to bring your insurance card with you. Do you have any other questions about the fasting instructions or the location of the lab?
PATIENT: No, that’s perfectly clear. 8 hours, no food, just water. City General Hospital, 123 Main Street, 555-1234. Insurance card. I’ve got it. Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. I think… I think that’s all for now. I’ll schedule the blood work as soon as possible. I appreciate your time and… your honesty. Hopefully it’s nothing serious. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It has been… unsettling, to be frank.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Erxleben. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we’ll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any new symptoms while you're waiting for the results. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch shortly.
