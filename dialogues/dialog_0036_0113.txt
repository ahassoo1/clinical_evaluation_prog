DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, and I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s this…this going to the bathroom business. Seems I’m going more than I used to. It's a bother, really. Not a serious bother, mind you, just…frequent. My wife, bless her heart, she says I should get it checked. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. It's good that you're here to get it checked out, and it's always wise to listen to your wife when she expresses concern. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t know how much more there is to tell, honestly. I just…go. More often than I used to. At night, too. That’s the worst part. Used to sleep straight through, now…well, you get the picture. It’s not painful, not at all. Just…annoying. And disruptive. I don’t recall it being this bad before, but then again, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, increased frequency, particularly at night, and it's not associated with any pain. And you haven’t noticed any changes in the stream itself – like difficulty starting or stopping, or a weaker stream?
PATIENT: Hmm…stream? I don’t…I haven’t really paid attention to the stream, Doctor. Honestly. I go, and that’s about it. It seems normal enough. As normal as it ever was, I suppose. I’m a simple man, I don’t go around examining…things. Is that important? You doctors always ask such…detailed questions.
DOCTOR: It can be important, Mr. Segretto, and I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. We just try to cover all the bases. Okay, so no noticeable changes in the stream. Let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst lately?
PATIENT: Thirst? Not really. I drink when I’m thirsty, same as always. Mostly water, sometimes a little juice with breakfast. My wife makes sure I stay hydrated. She’s very particular about that, always has been. I can't say I've been more thirsty than usual, or less, for that matter. It's just…normal. Everything feels a bit normal, except for the bathroom trips, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any unusual color or smell?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Definitely not. I’d notice that, wouldn’t I? And the smell…well, it smells like urine, Doctor. What do you expect it to smell like? You're asking very strange things. I'm a farmer, I know what things should smell like, and it smells normal. Look, I'm telling you, it's just that I go more often. Is that so hard to believe?
DOCTOR: No, it's not hard to believe, Mr. Segretto. I apologize if I'm making you feel like I’m questioning you. It's just my job to gather as much information as possible. Okay, so no blood, no change in smell. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? High blood pressure? Hmm… Let me think. Old man Henderson down the road has diabetes, poor fella lost a toe. I don't think I have that. My wife does all the doctoring appointments, she tells me what I need to know. I think she mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high a few years back, but she handled it. Pills, I think. I just take what she gives me. I don't really follow all that medical talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially high cholesterol in the past, managed with medication. And your wife handles the details of your medical care. Do you recall any surgeries or hospital stays you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes, I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. That was a long time ago. Had to have a cast. And… I think I had my appendix out when I was younger, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. Nothing recently, nothing at all. Mostly just aches and pains from farming, you know? It’s a hard life.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, appendix removed long ago, and generally aches and pains from farming. Now, do you have a family history of any medical conditions, like kidney problems or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Prostate… issues? Now there's a topic. My father… well, he didn’t talk much about…those things. Old-fashioned man, he was. My uncle, on my mother’s side, he had something with his bladder, I think. But I don’t recall the specifics. Everyone gets something when they get old, doesn't it? It's just the way of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides whatever your wife gives you for your cholesterol?
PATIENT: Well, she gives me a little white pill every morning with my breakfast, for the cholesterol. And… sometimes, if my joints are acting up, she gives me another one, a pink one. That helps with the aches. Besides that…no. I don’t like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel sluggish. I try to stay active, keep moving. It's better than sitting around, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright, a white pill for cholesterol and a pink pill for joint aches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife makes a lovely borscht, very hearty. Never had a reaction to anything. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m out in the fields, but that’s just the hay, I think. Nothing serious. I'm a pretty robust fellow, always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a brief neurological exam. We'll also check your prostate with a digital rectal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute, Doctor. A…digital what now? You want to… examine there? That seems a bit… unnecessary, doesn’t it? I just told you I’m going to the bathroom more often, that’s all. Surely there are other ways to figure it out. I'm not comfortable with that, not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Segretto. You’re right to ask questions. A digital rectal exam, or DRE, allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate gland. Because you're experiencing increased urinary frequency, particularly at night, it's an important part of the evaluation to rule out an enlarged prostate, which is a common cause of these symptoms. It’s a quick exam, and I’ll explain everything as I go. However, if you are truly uncomfortable, we can proceed without it, but it would limit my ability to accurately assess the cause of your symptoms. We could start with a urine sample to check for infection or other abnormalities, and then discuss referral to a urologist for further evaluation if needed. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A urologist? More doctors? This is getting ridiculous. Fine, fine. If it's absolutely necessary… but be quick about it. And explain everything, like you said. I don't want any surprises. And no poking around! Just a quick feel, that's all. Honestly, I don't see why a simple urine sample isn't enough. But… alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, Doctor. Be very gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain each step as I go. First, I need you to lie on your side with your knees bent. Then, I’ll lubricate a gloved, finger and gently insert it into your rectum. It may feel like you have the urge to urinate, but try to relax. I’m just feeling the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. Okay, that’s done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there were no obvious lumps or tenderness. This is not necessarily cause for alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. Now, I'd like to collect a urine sample for a urinalysis. I’ll give you a cup, and I’d like you to collect a midstream sample – that means starting to urinate, stopping briefly, and then collecting the sample. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? That doesn’t sound good. I knew I shouldn’t have come here. Always something. A midstream… like fishing? You mean I have to start and stop? This is getting more complicated by the minute. Alright, alright. Give me the cup. Let’s get this over with. But if it involves any more poking and prodding, I’m leaving. I’m a farmer, not a…guinea pig.
DOCTOR: No, not like fishing exactly. Just start to urinate, then stop the flow for a few seconds, and then collect the sample in the cup. This helps ensure we get a clean sample. And no, there won’t be any more poking and prodding, I promise. Just take your time, and let me know when you’re finished. I’ll be right here. And don't worry, it’s a very common procedure. We just want to rule out infection or other issues.
PATIENT: Common, she says. Easy for you to say.
