DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…eating thing. I get full awful quick these days. Don’t seem to be able to eat a proper meal anymore. It’s been going on a few months now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing early satiety – feeling full quickly – and it's been going on for a few months. That’s helpful to know. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s…like, I used to enjoy a good plate of salmon and rice, you know? A decent helping. Now? A few bites and I’m done. And it’s not a comfortable full, either. It's like…stuffed. Happens with pretty much everything, to be honest. Soup, bread…doesn't matter much. It just…stops being good after a little bit. My wife, she makes a lovely stew, but I can barely finish a bowl anymore. It worries her, and it’s starting to bother me too, not being able to eat right.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s not just the amount you can eat, but the feeling of being uncomfortably full even after a small portion, and it’s affecting multiple types of food. And it’s been impacting your enjoyment of meals, which is understandably concerning. Before we go further, has there been any unintentional weight loss along with this change in appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Weight loss…I haven’t really weighed myself lately, to be honest. My wife does most of that sort of thing. But I reckon my pants are a little looser than they used to be. Not a lot, but…yeah, probably a little. I just figured it was getting older. I’m eighty-eight, after all.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Mr. Obarr. But even small, unintentional weight loss is worth investigating, especially alongside these other symptoms. Let’s talk about other things you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or indigestion accompanying your meals?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thankfully. Nausea…sometimes a little queasy before I start eating, now that you mention it. Like I don’t really want to eat, even though I know I should. And heartburn…yes, actually. More often at night, if I eat anything too close to bedtime. Indigestion…sometimes, yeah. A little bit of bloating, too, after a meal. It’s all a bit of a mess, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have early satiety, unintentional weight loss, occasional nausea before meals, heartburn – particularly at night – and some post-meal bloating and indigestion. That gives us a more complete picture. Now, I'm going to ask you about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Let’s see…high blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on some pills for that, years ago. Still take ‘em, every day. Otherwise…nothing major, really. Had a bad flu when I was a kid, and broke my arm once falling out of a tree, but nothing that's bothered me recently. No diabetes, no heart problems, that I know of. My wife keeps track of most of that sort of thing, to be honest. She’s good at that.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Obarr. High blood pressure, managed with medication. That's good that it's being treated. And no other significant past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think…yes, actually. Appendectomy when I was young, and…and a hernia operation years ago. That was…oh, must be twenty years ago now. Both were done at the hospital in town. They didn’t cause me any trouble afterwards, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hernia repair in the past. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…hmm. My mother, she had…stomach trouble, I think. Some kind of cancer, eventually. My father, he lived a long life, healthy as a horse, mostly. My brother, he had heart problems. That's all I can really remember, to be honest. We didn’t really talk much about medical things. More about fishing and hunting. It wasn’t a talking family.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of stomach cancer in your mother and heart problems in your brother. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned medication for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name and the dosage, if you know it?
PATIENT: Let me see…the little bottle…it says…Lisinopril. 20 milligrams. Take one every morning. Been taking it for…oh, must be fifteen years now. It seems to keep the blood pressure alright. No side effects that I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure. And besides that, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the Lisinopril. And maybe a little bit of fish oil sometimes, but my wife buys that, and I forget if I’m actually taking it or not. I'm not one for taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily Lisinopril, and occasional fish oil. Now, I'm going to ask about any allergies you have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, peanuts…everything, really. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. My wife is the one with the hay fever, poor thing. Sneezes her way through the springtime every year.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked a bit, but I always thought it was a silly habit. My wife doesn’t smoke either. Bad for you, plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of smoking. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe on a weekend. Nothing heavy. Haven’t had a proper drink in…oh, weeks, probably. I don't really crave it. It’s more of a social thing, if someone offers me a glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol consumption. Now, do you live alone, or do you have support at home?
PATIENT: I live with my wife, of course. Been married sixty years now. She looks after me, and I look after her, as best as I can. She’s a good woman. She does all the cooking, thankfully. And remembering things. I’m starting to forget where I put my glasses half the time.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Obarr. Having that support is very important. Now, before I proceed with a physical exam, are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think…not really. Oh! Wait. Sometimes, after I eat, even a little bit, I get a bit…tired. Not exhausted, just…lethargic. Like I need a nap. And it’s not a good tired, like after a hard day’s work. It's more of a…blah, you know? It usually passes after an hour or so. But it’s there. That’s about it, I think. I’m probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so post-meal fatigue – a feeling of “blah” and lethargy – that resolves after about an hour. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Obarr, I think I have a good initial understanding of what's been going on. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind. Just be gentle, alright? My wife says I bruise easily these days. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Obarr. I will be very gentle. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in the upper middle part of your stomach when I press here. It’s not sharp pain, but you do flinch slightly. No masses or enlargement that I can feel at this point. I’m also listening for bowel sounds now… Bowel sounds are present, but a little quiet. Do you feel any pain anywhere else when I press on your abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…that’s where it bothers me a bit. Right there. Not awful, just…uncomfortable. And a little bit lower down, on the right side, it feels a bit…full. Like something is pressing there. The rest…not really. Just the top and right side. And it's not constant, you know? It comes and goes. Mostly after I eat something.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the upper middle abdomen and a feeling of fullness on the right side, especially after eating. I don’t feel any rebound tenderness – which is a sign of inflammation – and no guarding, which would suggest the abdominal muscles are tightening to protect something. Your skin feels normal. Pulses are good in all four extremities, and there’s no swelling. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I'm considering a few possibilities. Your symptoms – early satiety, unintentional weight loss, nausea, heartburn, post-meal fatigue, and abdominal tenderness – could be related to a number of things, including gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or a problem with your gallbladder. It’s also important to rule out more serious conditions. To help me narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on, go right ahead. What sort of tests are we talking about? I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding, but I'm not good with needles, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Obarr. I understand. We'll try to minimize anything unpleasant. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a stool test to rule out any bleeding or infection. I also think it would be helpful to get an upper endoscopy. Now, the endoscopy does involve inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and take a biopsy if needed. It requires some preparation, but it’s the best way to directly examine your stomach and rule out ulcers, inflammation, or cancer. It’s done under sedation, so you won’t feel much discomfort during the procedure. The blood tests just require a simple blood draw, and the stool test is collected at home. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: An endoscopy…that sounds…a bit much. Is it absolutely necessary? I'm not a fan of poking around inside, if you know what I mean. The blood tests and stool tests…that’s alright. I can manage those. But that endoscopy…can’t we try something else first? What happens if they find something?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Mr. Obarr. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned about an endoscopy. It’s not a pleasant procedure, and it’s perfectly okay to want to explore other options first. Given your discomfort with the endoscopy, let’s start with the blood tests and stool test. We can also try a trial of a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces stomach acid – for a few weeks to see if it improves your symptoms. If your symptoms don’t improve with the PPI, or if they worsen, then we can revisit the possibility of an endoscopy. Would that be a reasonable approach for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. A trial of the medication first. See if that helps. If it doesn’t, then…then we can talk about the other thing. But let’s try that first. I appreciate you listening to my concerns. It's nice to know you’re not just rushing into things. What does this medication…this PPI…do, exactly? And what are the side effects?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Obarr. It’s important you feel comfortable and informed. A proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. This can help with symptoms like heartburn, nausea, and indigestion, and allow your stomach lining to heal if it’s inflamed. Common PPIs include omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole. The most common side effects are usually mild and include headache, diarrhea, or constipation. In rare cases, long-term use of PPIs has been linked to certain nutrient deficiencies, but this is uncommon with short-term use. I'll monitor you closely while you're on the medication, and we can adjust the dosage if needed. I’m going to prescribe you omeprazole 20mg once daily, to be taken in the morning before breakfast. It's important to take it consistently, even if you're feeling better. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about the medication and its potential side effects. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you're doing. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if you experience any concerning side effects, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Omeprazole in the morning. I can do that. And the follow-up in four weeks. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on and what we’re trying. Thank you. And thank you for not rushing me into anything. You’re a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. My priority is always to ensure you feel comfortable and informed about your care. Now, is there anything else I can address today, or any questions you may have before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve covered everything beautifully. I just need to get that prescription and try this medication. Thank you again for your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will give you the prescription on your way out. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day!
