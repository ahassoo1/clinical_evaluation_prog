DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it's about these... spells, I guess you'd call them. My wife, she keeps saying I get confused. Not me, confused, but... well, she worries too much, always has. But lately, she says I ask the same questions over and over, and I don't always remember what I was doing just a few minutes ago. It’s quite irritating, actually.
DOCTOR: Irritating, you say. I understand. It’s good your wife is observant, though. Repetitive questioning and recent memory lapses can be concerning. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's been happening. When did you first notice these… episodes, as you call them?
PATIENT: Episodes. Yes, that's a good word for it. It started… oh, maybe six months ago? Hard to say exactly. Things just… slipped a bit. At first, it was small things. Misplacing my tools, forgetting what I went to the store for. But it’s been getting worse. My wife says I asked her three times yesterday if she'd fed the cat. The cat was practically begging for food, but she'd already done it, of course. Sheesh.
DOCTOR: Six months, and a gradual worsening. Asking repetitive questions, specifically about things that have recently occurred. And you say this is impacting your daily routine?
PATIENT: Routine? Well, I still go to work, don’t I? Tile setting is a skilled trade, you know. Not something you just forget how to do. But… it takes longer now. I have to double-check my measurements more often. And sometimes… sometimes I get a bit turned around on the job site. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been doing this for forty years! It shouldn’t be happening. It’s not like I'm slow, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re still functioning, still able to work, but experiencing increased difficulty and requiring more effort. This is helpful information. Now, let’s move onto some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Speech? What do you mean, changes? I speak English perfectly fine. Always have. My wife complains I talk too much, but that’s just her. I haven’t been… stumbling over my words or anything like that. I can tell you exactly what I was doing last Tuesday, if you’d like. Laying slate in Mrs. Henderson’s foyer. Beautiful work, if I do say so myself. Not that anyone asks for my opinion these days.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any difficulties with vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No. Perfectly clear. I need my glasses for reading, of course, like any man my age. But my distance vision is fine. I can see a hairline crack in the tile from across the room. A good tile setter needs good eyes, you know. It’s all about precision. I don’t go around bumping into things, if that’s what you’re asking. My wife might say I don’t see when she tells me to do something, but that’s a different story altogether.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back. Everything was fine, thankfully. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but the doctor said it’s nothing to worry about. Just watch the salt, he said. And arthritis in my hands, of course. Comes with the trade. Years of kneeling, years of cutting stone. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been a strong man. Never been one for complaining or being sick. Don’t have the time for it.
DOCTOR: Prostate checked, hypertension, and arthritis. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had a reason for one. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree, but they just put it in a cast. Healed up fine. Strong bone, I always had. I've always been very careful on the job site, you know. Safety is important. Don't need to be messing around with operations if you can avoid it. Too much downtime.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your family… is there any history of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, now there's a question. My mother... she got a bit forgetful towards the end. Said she didn't remember things. My wife says it runs in her family, actually. Her aunt, she had to go into a home, they said. Something about her mind... slipping away. Not a pleasant thing, if you ask me. My wife worries about that, constantly bringing it up. Honestly, it's quite irritating. I'm nothing like them, though. Perfectly sharp, as far as I'm concerned.
DOCTOR: History of memory issues in both maternal and paternal families. Now, let’s discuss your social habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. Cambodian red wine, if I can get it. My wife doesn't care for it, says it tastes like vinegar, but I enjoy it. It helps me relax after a long day on the job site. And maybe a beer with the boys on a Saturday. But I don't go out drinking every night, if that’s what you’re implying. I'm a responsible man. Not a troublemaker.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father, he smoked. Terrible habit. Ruined his lungs, they said. I always thought it was foolish. Makes you cough, smells terrible, wastes your money. No, I’ve always been very careful about my health. Fresh air and hard work, that’s what keeps a man going. Not filling your lungs with poison.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I think I have enough information for now. I’d like to conduct a brief physical and neurological examination. This will involve checking your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. It's standard procedure, of course. Will you permit me to proceed?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But don’t expect me to be performing any circus tricks. I’m a tile setter, not an acrobat. And don’t take too long, I have work to get back to. This is a waste of my time, frankly, but if it will appease my wife, then fine. Just… be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. I’ll begin with your vital signs. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is regular at 78. Temperature is normal. Now, please follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head. Good. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes… Reflexes are… normal, albeit slightly diminished in the lower extremities. Balance is… somewhat unsteady. Please open your eyes. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Please answer to the best of your ability. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Honestly. Alright, alright. Today is… August 2nd. 2025. Is that what you wanted to know? I keep track of things, you know. It’s my business, I need to know the date for invoices and jobs. Don’t think I'm losing my mind just because my wife worries too much. Now, can we get this over with? I have slate to lay.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Correct. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What kind of test is this? Fine. Go ahead. Give me your three words. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please remember them, and I will ask you to recall them later. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. What city are we in?
PATIENT: Really? You need to ask me that? It’s… well, it’s a city. A big city. Lots of traffic. I suppose it’s… I don't pay much attention to these things. I'm usually on a job site. Is it… Los Angeles? No, wait. That's not right. It's…urban. That’s what they said when I booked the appointment. I think. Is that good enough? Honestly. It's not important to me. I just need to lay tile.
DOCTOR: Reports difficulty recalling the city, despite residing within it. Now, can you tell me who the current President is?
PATIENT: The President? Now you're just testing me. I don’t follow politics. I have more important things to worry about, like grout lines and level surfaces. Is it… that woman? No, the other one. The one… oh, it doesn't matter. I don't pay attention to those people. It's all just talk. A waste of time. Can we move on, please? I am a skilled tradesman, not a politician.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. Based on your responses, and the physical examination, there are some areas of concern. Your recent memory appears to be somewhat impaired, as evidenced by your difficulty recalling the three words and the current date. Your balance is also slightly unsteady, and you have difficulty with recall of recent information. Now, I'm not saying you have a serious condition, but these findings warrant further investigation. I recommend a series of cognitive tests and a neurological consultation. I will also order a blood test to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. What do you think?
PATIENT: A neurological consultation? Blood tests? You're telling me I'm losing my mind? Just because I don't remember three silly words and can't name the President? This is ridiculous! My wife has filled your head with nonsense, hasn’t she? I'm perfectly fine. I lay tile every day! It's physical work, it keeps me sharp. I don’t need a neurologist poking around in my brain! And blood tests? What for? I eat healthy, I'm a responsible man! This is a waste of time and money. No. Absolutely not. I’m not doing any of this. I'll just… manage. And tell your wife to stop worrying so much. It’s bad for my blood pressure. I think I've had enough for one day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to ensure your well-being. While you may feel perfectly capable now, these subtle changes can indicate a progressive condition. Dismissing them could have serious consequences. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, I respect your autonomy. I will document your refusal of further testing and consultation. But I must emphasize that these symptoms should be monitored closely. If you experience any worsening of your memory, balance, or cognitive function, please seek immediate medical attention. Here are the discharge instructions and a summary of today's findings. Take care, Mr. Lason. And please, reconsider the neurological referral. .
