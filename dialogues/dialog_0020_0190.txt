DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Oh, yes. Well, I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, you see. Like I might fall. It’s been… happening for a little while now, I believe. It’s difficult to say exactly how long. I don’t recall dates very well, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady… like you might fall. And you said it’s been going on for a little while. I understand remembering dates can be tricky. Can you tell me a bit more about when you notice this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… that is a good question. It doesn’t seem to be after any specific activity, not that I can recall. Sometimes it’s just… there, when I’m standing. Other times… when I walk, perhaps? It’s rather frustrating, I must admit. It feels… random. I apologize for not being more precise. My husband… he always kept track of things. It’s been difficult adjusting since… well, since he passed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright, and completely understandable, that you're finding it difficult to pinpoint specific times, especially with everything you’ve been through. It’s more important to get a sense of what it feels like. When you feel unsteady, is it more like dizziness—a spinning sensation—or more like weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a very helpful distinction, Doctor. I believe it's more… weakness, yes. Not a spinning feeling at all. It’s as if my legs simply won't hold me properly. Though sometimes… there's a lightness in my head, perhaps? A fleeting sensation, not strong. But mostly, it’s the legs. They feel… unreliable. I do apologize for being so vague. I’m trying my best to explain it.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Lilyanna. You're explaining it very well. We'll figure this out. You mentioned this has been happening for a little while. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… Let me think. I work, you see. As a rotary drill operator. It’s rather physical work. I have noticed it feels… more pronounced after a long shift. Perhaps the fatigue? It's difficult to tell if that's the cause, though. I always work very hard, and have for many years. I suppose it could be simply exhaustion. Though I’ve always been quite strong. It's just… lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rotary drill operator. That is physically demanding work. And you've noticed it's more pronounced after a long shift. That’s good information to have. Have you had any falls as a result of this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Thankfully, no. Not a complete fall, no. Though I’ve stumbled a few times. Had to… brace myself against things. A wall, a piece of equipment. I’m rather careful, you see. I don't want to injure myself. It’s… concerning, though, the possibility of falling. Especially at work. It could be… dangerous. I worry about that.
DOCTOR: That's good that you haven't had a complete fall, but stumbling is definitely concerning, especially given your work environment. It's right to be cautious. Now, aside from the unsteadiness and stumbling, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. No… I don’t believe so. Not that I can recall. Sometimes, a slight… buzzing in my ears, perhaps? Very faint. I’ve always had rather sensitive hearing. It comes and goes. But I wouldn’t say it’s related to this unsteadiness. No headaches, no blurred vision, no… anything else that springs to mind. I really am trying to remember. It's frustrating when things aren't clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight buzzing in your ears. We'll keep that in mind. Now, Lilyanna, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your balance, reflexes, and things like that. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I want to understand what’s happening, and I’m willing to do whatever is necessary. Just… please be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Though I suppose that’s to be expected.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it slow and easy, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. There. Standing. Though, if you don't mind, perhaps I could lean against the wall? Just for… stability. I apologize for being cautious, but I don't want to risk falling during the examination.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. Safety first. Lean against the wall as much as you need to. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please close your eyes and stand with your feet together?
PATIENT: Feet together… yes. Like this? It feels… precarious, even with the wall. But I’m trying. It's rather unnerving, closing my eyes. I feel… vulnerable. Is this alright? Should I open my eyes? I don't want to make you worry.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Lilyanna. It’s alright to feel a little unnerving. Just focus on keeping your balance. I’m right here. Okay, please keep your eyes closed for a moment. Now, I’m going to gently push on your shoulders, just to see how your body reacts. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Gentle push… yes, that is alright. But please, be gentle. I don’t want to lose my balance. It’s… a bit frightening, you see. I’m trying to remain still, but I feel myself swaying. This is… not comfortable. Are you seeing anything concerning? I apologize for being difficult. I just… I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that's enough for now. Please open your eyes. You did very well. What I’m seeing is a bit of instability with your balance, even with minimal pressure. It’s good you haven’t fallen, but this suggests we need to investigate further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… unsettling. Medical history… hmm. Let me see. I was told, years ago, that my blood pressure was slightly elevated. I don’t recall the specifics. I saw a doctor then, regularly, and they prescribed some medication. I took it for a while, but… it made me feel unwell. So, I stopped taking it. Perhaps that was foolish. And… my husband, bless his soul, always handled the medical details. He kept track of everything. I really don’t have much to offer, I’m afraid. I've never had any major illnesses or surgeries. Nothing significant, at least that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of elevated blood pressure, medication discontinued due to side effects. That’s important information. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t believe so, no. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. Though… there was one time, many years ago, when I had a rash after taking some sort of antibiotic. It wasn’t severe, and it went away on its own. But I can’t recall the name of the medication. It was a very long time ago. I really wish I had kept better track of these things. My husband always said I was too carefree.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible antibiotic rash. No other known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I stopped taking the blood pressure medication years ago, as I mentioned. And I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. I always believed in a good, healthy diet. My husband and I grew most of our own vegetables. I haven't felt the need for anything else. Though… perhaps I should reconsider that. It seems my body is… changing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had problems with her heart, later in life. She passed away when I was quite young, from heart failure, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. He lost a leg, due to complications from the illness. Those are the only major medical conditions I recall in my immediate family. My siblings… they seem to be quite healthy, thankfully. Though we haven’t seen each other in many years. Life has a way of… separating people, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart failure and diabetes. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work very hard, as I've mentioned. Rotary drill operator. It's physically demanding work. Long hours, often outdoors. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that's it. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't had the energy for it lately. And… I don't get much exercise, beyond the physical labor at work. It’s… a bit monotonous, if I’m honest. Work, eat, sleep. Repeat. It’s not a very exciting life, but it's always been… stable. Or, it was stable. Until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, physically demanding work, no smoking, limited alcohol, limited exercise. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. It's better to be thorough, I suppose. Though… I must confess, I do get a bit anxious when doctors take my blood pressure. It always seems to be higher in the office. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very common, Lilyanna. It’s called white coat hypertension. Your blood pressure can definitely be higher in the office due to anxiety. We’ll take that into account. Okay, let’s see… Blood pressure is 150/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, I’m concerned about your balance issues, elevated blood pressure, and faint heart sounds. It's hard to say definitively what's going on without further testing, but it could be related to several things, including your blood pressure, potential heart issues, or something else entirely. I recommend some further testing, including an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and potentially a referral to a cardiologist. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… a blood test… a cardiologist… It all sounds rather… serious. But… if that’s what’s necessary, then yes, of course. Please, proceed with whatever testing you deem appropriate. I want to understand what’s happening, and I trust your judgment. Though… could you explain a little bit more about what these tests involve? I do get anxious about medical procedures, you see. And… is this likely to be expensive? I do have private insurance, but… I worry about the costs.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. I understand your anxiety, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about costs. Let’s start with the tests. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We'll place some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and it takes just a few minutes. The blood test will involve taking a sample of your blood to check things like your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. That also takes just a few minutes. As for the costs, your private insurance should cover most of it, but there may be a copay or deductible. I can have our billing department contact your insurance company to give you a more accurate estimate before we proceed. I also want to be upfront: these tests will help us rule out or identify potential problems, but they don't necessarily give us a definitive diagnosis. If the tests are abnormal, we may need to consider further investigation, such as an echocardiogram or a referral to a cardiologist. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: An EKG… blood test… potentially more tests… a cardiologist… It’s a lot to take in. But… yes, it does make sense, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for offering to contact my insurance company. That would be… very helpful. So, if I understand correctly, the EKG and blood test are the first steps? And then we’ll see what the results say before deciding what to do next? That sounds… reasonable. Yes, let’s proceed with the EKG and blood test. Whenever you’re ready. Though… perhaps I could sit down for a moment before we begin? I do feel a little faint. I apologize for being difficult. It’s just… all this talk of medical procedures is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. Absolutely. Please, sit down and take a few deep breaths. There's no rush. We'll take things at your pace. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I want to make sure you’re comfortable before we proceed. Once you're ready, we can start with the EKG. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the procedure in more detail and place the stickers. Is there anything else I can do to make you feel more comfortable right now?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I’m alright for now. Just knowing what to expect… and having you explain everything so clearly… it helps. I appreciate your patience. And… thank you again for offering to contact my insurance company. That’s one less thing to worry about. Yes, I believe I’m ready for the EKG whenever the nurse is ready. Thank you. Really. You've been very kind. I must confess, I haven’t felt this reassured by a doctor in a long time. It’s… a relief.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re a team, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Just take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly, and I’ll be nearby if you need anything at all. .
