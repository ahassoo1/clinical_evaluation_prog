DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Bombara. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been…well, it’s just a bit worrying, to be honest. I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand your concern. Hmm… and how long have you noticed this lump, Amy?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s been maybe… three or four weeks now? It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just felt a little different, you know? But it’s grown a bit since then.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four weeks. And has the size change been gradual, or did you notice it suddenly get bigger at some point?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It wasn’t like I woke up one day and it was huge. More like… I just noticed my clothes feeling a little tighter, and when I was… well, just feeling around, I could feel it more clearly each week. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And is it…painful at all?
PATIENT: No, not really painful. It’s…uncomfortable sometimes, like a dull ache if I press on it, but not sharp pain. It doesn’t hurt to move around or anything like that. Mostly, it’s just the feeling of something being there that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no sharp pain, just a dull ache with pressure. And is there anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. It doesn't seem to be related to what I eat, or how much I move. It’s just… there. I guess lying down might be a little more comfortable than standing, but honestly, it's not a huge difference.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has there been any change in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I’ve been a little more…constipated than usual, for the past couple of weeks. Not severe, but definitely not as regular as I normally am. Is that… connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Constipation can sometimes be related to abdominal masses, but it’s not always the case. Let's get a bit more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – any fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. No nausea or vomiting either. And my weight… I haven’t really been weighing myself regularly, but I don’t think I’ve lost any weight. Maybe a little tired, but that could just be the summer heat, you know? It's been very warm.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take most medications without any problems. My wife always double-checks, just in case, but I haven't had any issues.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing regularly. Occasionally I’ll take something for a headache, like ibuprofen, but that’s it. No daily medications or anything like that. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, but that was just a simple fracture. Nothing major since then, thankfully. No serious illnesses, as far as I know. I’ve been pretty healthy overall, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a teenager, and a broken arm. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother had… well, she had some problems with her stomach, later in life. She didn’t really talk about it much, but she saw a specialist for a while. My father was healthy as a horse, if I’m being honest. And my siblings… nothing major that I’m aware of. It’s not something we discuss a lot, to be frank. We're not a very… medical family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Alright. And finally, just a quick question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I don't smoke. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely. And definitely no recreational drugs. I try to live a pretty healthy lifestyle, mostly. I mean, besides this lump, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very good to know, Amy. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your abdomen, and gently feel around to get a better idea of what’s going on. It won't be painful, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Bombara. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I appreciate you explaining everything first. It helps to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they're a little…quieter than I'd like, but present. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain. Hmm… I do feel a distinct mass in your lower abdomen, as you described. It’s about… two centimeters in diameter, firm, and not particularly tender to the touch. It appears to be mobile, which is… reasonably good. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is also good. I’m not feeling any enlarged lymph nodes in the area either. Okay, Amy. Based on this preliminary exam, it's difficult to say exactly what this mass is. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a hernia, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful. That will give us a much more detailed look at what’s going on in there. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Dr. Bombara. Blood work and a CT scan. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s a little worrying, of course, but I feel better knowing we’re taking steps to find out what it is. Yes, let’s do the blood work and the scan. Do you have any idea how long it will take to get the results? And…will I need a referral for the CT scan?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you feel that way. As for the results, the blood work should be back within a couple of days, usually. The CT scan… that can take a little longer, perhaps three to five business days, depending on the facility’s schedule and how busy they are. And yes, you will need a referral for the CT scan. I'll write that out for you now, and it includes the imaging center I recommend – they're very good and have a quick turnaround time. They'll contact you directly to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please contact us immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that's very helpful, thank you. Three to five days for the scan… I can manage that. And thank you for the warning about contacting you if anything changes. I appreciate that. Let me think… Yes. What… what are the possibilities? I know you said it could be a number of things, but… are we talking about anything serious? I don’t want to panic, but I’d rather be prepared. It's just… it's always in the back of your mind, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable question, Amy, and I appreciate you asking it directly. It’s always best to address those concerns. It's difficult to say definitively without the results of the scans. The possibilities could include a benign lipoma, which is a fatty tumor, or a hernia, which is a protrusion of tissue through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. Those are relatively common and usually not serious. However, it could also be something else, and that's why we need to investigate further. Less common, but we need to rule them out, are possibilities like a bowel obstruction, a cyst, or, in rare cases, a tumor. But please, don't jump to conclusions. Worrying won’t help, and we haven’t even done the scans yet. We're taking all the necessary steps to get a clear diagnosis and determine the best course of action. I will be honest with you, Amy. The CT scan is necessary to rule out anything serious. And, if the CT scan shows something concerning, we will discuss further steps, which could involve a consultation with a surgeon or a gastroenterologist. But let's focus on getting the scan done first, and then we'll go from there. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Rule out the serious things first. I appreciate your honesty, Dr. Bombara. It's better to know, even if it’s scary. Okay. So, the CT scan, and then we'll talk again. I'll contact them to schedule it. And I’ll keep an eye on things, and contact you if anything changes. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help ease your mind, even a little. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your scan. And remember, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly when they come back. I'll write a quick note summarizing our conversation for my records. Take care, Amy, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
