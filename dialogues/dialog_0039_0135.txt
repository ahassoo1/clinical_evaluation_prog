DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Radillo. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. I am here… because of my ear. It is… leaking something. A liquid, you understand? It started a few days ago, maybe four. It makes hearing… difficult, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear… for about four days, and it's affecting your hearing. I see. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… not much, but it is there. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellowish. And it smells… not good. Not a strong smell, but… noticeable. It comes out when I… push on my ear, or when I lie down on that side. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Clear or yellowish liquid, a bit of an odor, comes out when you press or lie on that side. Alright. And has there been any pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not a big pain, Doctor. More like… a pressure. A fullness. Like something is inside. And when I touch… around the ear, it is… tender. But not always. It comes and goes. It is not a sharp pain, you understand? More like… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and tenderness around the ear, coming and going. Not a sharp pain, more uncomfortable. Have you noticed any fever, or any ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I do not think so. I have not taken my temperature, but I do not feel warm. And ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A very quiet ringing. Like… a high note, very faint. It is not constant, Doctor. Only sometimes when I am… very quiet, perhaps. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No fever, occasional quiet ringing… I understand. It’s helpful that you're able to describe it so well. And have you had any issues with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. When I was a boy, I had many ear infections. Very common, the doctor told my mother. I remember… much pain, and the doctor would give me… drops, for the ear. It was a long time ago. And then… when I was younger man, I had some problem with… wax build-up, I think. They cleaned it out at the clinic. But nothing… major, like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of ear infections as a child and wax build-up when you were younger. Good to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not currently. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor… stopped it, a few years ago. It was not… helpful, he said. Allergies… hmm. I believe I am allergic to… some kinds of dust. It makes me sneeze, and my eyes water. And… cats. I cannot be near cats. I start to cough. That is all I know of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, allergy to dust and cats. Thank you. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears, just to see what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I hope you can see what is the problem. It is… troubling me.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Just lean back for me. I'm going to gently put this into your ear. It doesn't go in very far. Hmm… Okay, I see some redness in the ear canal, and a little bit of discharge. The eardrum itself looks… cloudy. It’s difficult to see clearly because of the discharge, but it doesn’t look like it’s ruptured. And your right ear… looks much better. The ear canal is clear, and the eardrum looks normal. Alright, so it looks like you have an infection in your left ear. It’s not severe, but it definitely needs to be treated.
PATIENT: An infection… in the left ear. I see. That explains the… leaking and the pressure. Is it… serious, Doctor? Will I… lose my hearing? And what… what do I need to do? Will it need… surgery? I am… worried, you understand.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Mr. Radillo. It’s not serious in the sense that it's not life-threatening. And it’s unlikely you’ll lose your hearing, especially if we treat it promptly. It sounds like it's an outer ear infection, sometimes called otitis externa, or swimmer’s ear, although you don’t necessarily need to be a swimmer to get it. We'll start with ear drops, antibiotic drops to kill the infection. I’m going to write you a prescription for that. I’ll also give you some pain relief medication, just in case you need it. And I want you to keep your ear dry – no swimming, no getting water in your ear when you shower. Surgery is very unlikely to be needed. We’ll see how you respond to the ear drops. I want you to come back in a week to check on your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ear drops… and keep it dry. A week… to come back. Yes, that sounds… good, Doctor. Thank you. The prescription… can I get it at the pharmacy near my home? And… the pain relief… is it a strong medication? I do not want to… be sleepy all the time. I have things to do, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can definitely get the prescription filled at the pharmacy near your home. Here's the printed prescription, and I've also electronically sent it to the pharmacy just in case. The pain relief medication is ibuprofen. It’s a common over-the-counter pain reliever, so it’s not very strong. It can cause some drowsiness in some people, but it's generally mild. You can take it as needed for pain or discomfort. If it makes you too sleepy, just stop taking it. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… okay. Not too strong. Good. No, I think that is… all my questions, Doctor. You have explained everything… very clearly. Thank you for your help. I am… relieved to know it is not serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all before your follow-up appointment. And remember to keep that ear dry! Get well soon.
