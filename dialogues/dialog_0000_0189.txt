DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, good to meet you. Eighty-eight years young – impressive. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… business. You know, what comes out of the business end. There was blood. Not a whole lot, mind you, but enough to make me take notice. It's not right, is it? A man my age shouldn't be seeing that.
DOCTOR: Blood in your stool, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Yes, blood. Honestly, I don't need you typing everything into a machine. It's fairly obvious what I said. And it wasn’t exactly pouring out, if that makes you feel any better. More of a… streak. A reddish streak. Like someone put a bit too much ketchup in the mix, if you catch my meaning.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I document for my own records, Mr. Rowbottom. A reddish streak...and how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get me started on records. Waste of paper, if you ask me. Anyway… a few days now. Three, maybe four. I didn’t think much of it at first, just thought it was something I ate. But then it happened again. A man knows his own body, you see. And this isn’t normal. Not for a healthy man, anyway.
DOCTOR: Healthy, you say. And what would you consider healthy at eighty-eight, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Hmph. Don’t get smart with me, young lady. I flew planes for fifty years, alright? Fifty years! That takes a certain amount of… constitution. Still walk without a cane, still live on my own. Better than most your age, I’ll wager. But that’s beside the point. Something’s not right down there, and it’s concerning. I expect a proper examination, not a quiz on my definition of ‘healthy’.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s get to it then. Have you experienced any pain with this… issue?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More of a… discomfort. A bit of a cramp, now and then. Nothing to write home about, truly. Just… unsettling. And it’s ruining my appetite. A man needs a good appetite, you see. Especially when he’s… maintaining himself.
DOCTOR: And has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Change? Well, everything changes with age, doesn’t it? But no, not drastically. Still… regular, I suppose. Though maybe a bit… thinner than usual. And, well, I wouldn't call it hard, but it's not exactly smooth sailing, if you catch my meaning. It's… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any nausea, vomiting, or feeling fatigued lately?
PATIENT: No vomiting. Thank goodness for that. Though I have been a bit… tired, yes. But a man my age is always a bit tired, aren’t I? I used to have the energy of a young man, mind you. Flying all over the world. But that was… a long time ago. It’s probably just the weather. Damp. Makes everything feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Rowbottom, have you ever had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: A what-now? A colono-… what did you say? Sounds like something they do to clean out pipes. No, I haven’t had anything like that. And frankly, I don’t intend to. Sounds awfully invasive. I’ve lived a good life, young lady. I don’t need poking and prodding at this stage.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your age and this being a new symptom, I need to do a physical examination. It's necessary to rule things out. It's a fairly routine examination, Mr. Rowbottom, and I assure you, I’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. We'll need to check your abdomen and, yes, do a rectal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Rectal exam, you say? Honestly. This is getting ridiculous. Look, I’m not a fan of all this… poking and prodding. But I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… fine. But don’t take all day about it. And be gentle. A man deserves a little respect, even when he's… being examined.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need you to bend your knees and relax. I'll be right back with some lubricant and gloves.
PATIENT: Lubricant and gloves… Honestly, the indignity of it all. A man who flew planes… now this. Still. Better to get it over with, I suppose. Though I still think this is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m going to perform a brief abdominal exam first, then a rectal exam. I'll let you know what I find. Please try to relax. Your abdomen is soft, not particularly tender to the touch. Now, I’m going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may be slightly uncomfortable. Hmm. I do feel a small area of… irregularity on the left side. Not acutely painful, but it's there. There is also some… dark, stool on my glove. Alright. That’s all for now. Please get dressed. We'll discuss the findings in a moment.
PATIENT: Irregularity, is it? Dark stool... Honestly, the whole thing is most unpleasant. Glad that's over with. So? What does all that mean? Don't tell me it's something serious. I haven’t got time for serious. I’ve still got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Rowbottom, the irregularity and the presence of dark stool are concerning. While it could be something minor, like hemorrhoids, it's also possible – and we need to rule this out – that it's something more serious, such as a polyp or even a tumor. Given your age and this being a new symptom, I recommend a colonoscopy to investigate further. It’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of the bleeding and rule out anything concerning. I understand you’re not keen on the procedure, but it’s important for your health. I can refer you to a gastroenterologist who can discuss the procedure with you in more detail and answer any questions you may have. They'll likely want to do some blood work first to check your overall health and iron levels. What do you think?
PATIENT: A tumor, is it? Honestly, the things they come up with these days. Blood work, colonoscopies… It all sounds dreadfully invasive. And for what? I’ve lived eighty-eight years without all this poking and prodding, and I’ve done alright for myself. Look, I don't like the sound of this at all. Is there… anything else I can do? Some sort of… medicine? A different test? I really don't want to go through with all that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance. Unfortunately, there isn't a medicine to definitively diagnose the cause of bleeding. And while we could do a stool test to check for blood, it doesn’t always give us a clear answer and can miss things. A colonoscopy provides the most detailed view and allows us to take biopsies if necessary. I'm not trying to scare you, but ignoring this could have serious consequences. Polyps can become cancerous if left untreated. I can provide you with information on the procedure and what to expect. We can also discuss any concerns you have about the preparation process. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I strongly recommend following up with a specialist. I will write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-rated gastroenterologist in the area. Would you like me to also schedule a blood work appointment for you?
PATIENT: Eleanor Vance, you say? Another one. Honestly, it’s a parade of doctors. Alright, fine. Write your referral. And schedule the blood work. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if this Dr. Vance tries to push a colonoscopy on me… I want your number. I might need someone to… explain things to me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I've written the referral to Dr. Vance and scheduled a blood work appointment for you next week at the lab across the street. The lab results will be sent to both Dr. Vance and my office. Here are the referral and appointment details. The paperwork for the blood work is included as well. I’ve also included some information on preparing for a colonoscopy, just in case you decide to go that route. I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom, and I'm here to answer any questions you may have. My number is on the paperwork. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. I suppose that’s all. Don’t expect me to sing your praises, young lady. But thank you… I guess. I’ll see what this Dr. Vance has to say. And if she starts talking about poking and prodding… I’m calling you. Oh, and one more thing. Don’t bother sending me a bill. I haven’t got time for bills either. .
