DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have several patients scheduled, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I’m just… awfully tired during the day. Even though I’m using the machine they gave me for my sleep apnea. I thought that would fix everything, but it hasn't, really. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, the machine should be helping. You're utilizing it consistently, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Absolutely. Every single night. I wouldn’t skip it. I know it’s important. I check the numbers on the little screen every morning, and it says I’m getting a good reading… a good enough reading, anyway. I can tell you exactly what it was last night, if you’d like. 8.2 hours, with an AHI of 5.3. But still… the tiredness. It’s like I haven't slept at all.
DOCTOR: An AHI of 5.3… marginally acceptable, but not optimal. It suggests the machine isn’t fully controlling the apnea. However, simply being on the machine isn't a guarantee of feeling rested, you see. Let’s delve a little deeper. Beyond the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. I’ve been a little more irritable, I suppose. My daughter pointed it out, actually. She said I snap at her for no reason. And… my memory hasn’t been the best. Not terrible, mind you, I still remember everything from my teaching days, but… little things. Where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast. Things like that. It’s not a major problem, but it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: Irritability and minor memory lapses… potentially related, but require further investigation. Have you noticed any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. Not consistently, anyway. I get a little ache in the back of my neck sometimes, but that’s usually just from reading for too long. I still do a lot of reading, you see. History, mostly. But no pounding headaches, no. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite’s… normal, I think. I don’t have a huge appetite, never have, but I eat. My daughter tries to get me to eat more, she worries. I enjoy my food, when I eat it. No change there, no. I’ve actually been cooking more lately, trying new Spanish recipes. Though sometimes I forget an ingredient! It's frustrating, but small things.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. That’s… that’s been the hardest part, actually. When I try to read, I find my mind wandering. I have to reread paragraphs, sometimes pages, just to understand what I’ve read. And even simple conversations… I find myself losing track of what people are saying. It’s quite disconcerting, to be honest. It’s not like me at all. I was always a very sharp thinker. I taught university courses, you see. I had to be!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for years now. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. But other than that, nothing major. I try to stay healthy. I walk every day, I eat a good diet… well, mostly good. And I don’t smoke, never have. I take my medication religiously, too. My doctor always said I was a model patient, until this tiredness started, that is!
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled, cholecystectomy twenty years ago… and what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see... I have them right here. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And… that’s it. Just the lisinopril. And occasionally, an antacid, if I have heartburn. But that’s not regular. Just when I eat something spicy. It's all on there, if you need it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20 milligrams… Alright. Now, have you had any recent blood work done?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My primary care doctor ordered some tests a couple of months ago, just as a routine check-up. She said everything was normal, but I don’t have the results with me. I can get them sent over, if you’d like. She’s Dr. Ramirez, at the clinic on Oak Street. Very good doctor, she is. She's the one who referred me to you, actually, because of this daytime sleepiness. She wanted to make sure everything was alright with the sleep apnea treatment.
DOCTOR: Very well, send over the results from Dr. Ramirez. In the meantime, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your neurological function. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Here we go. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I always feel a bit awkward doing this, to be honest. I haven’t been properly examined in years.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious focal neurological deficits. These findings are… unremarkable. However, given your symptoms and history, I suspect something more may be going on.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, I suppose, that nothing obvious is wrong. But frustrating too, because it means we’re no closer to finding out why I’m so tired. What do you suspect, Doctor? What could it be, if everything seems normal? Is it possible it's something to do with the machine itself? Perhaps it’s not fitted properly, or… I don’t know. I'm just grasping at straws here.
DOCTOR: While the sleep apnea machine should be resolving your issues, it's not always definitive. It's possible the settings aren't optimized, but your reported AHI suggests adequate therapy. However, persistent fatigue, coupled with irritability and cognitive difficulties, could indicate several possibilities. We must rule out other underlying causes. I recommend a comprehensive blood panel, including thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, iron studies, and a complete metabolic panel. We should also consider a sleep study reassessment to confirm the machine's effectiveness and rule out positional apnea or other sleep disturbances. And, given your age, we should also consider a referral to a neurologist to rule out early cognitive impairment. It's a rather extensive workup, I understand, but it's necessary to identify the root cause of your symptoms. Do you have any questions, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: That… that's a lot. A neurologist? That sounds… serious. I understand you want to be thorough, and I appreciate that, Doctor. I just… I wasn’t expecting all this. The blood tests sound reasonable. And I suppose another sleep study wouldn't hurt. But a neurologist… is it likely to be something serious? Could it be… dementia or something? I’m not sure I like the sound of all this, to be honest. But I suppose if it's necessary… what’s the process for all of this? Will I need referrals? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Mr. Paske, let us not jump to conclusions. A referral to a neurologist does not automatically equate to a diagnosis of dementia. It is merely a precautionary measure to rule out any underlying neurological factors contributing to your symptoms. Given your age and cognitive complaints, it is prudent to investigate all possibilities. I will write you referrals for both a comprehensive blood panel and a repeat sleep study. I will also provide a referral to Dr. Chen, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. The blood tests should be completed within the week, and the sleep study can be scheduled at your convenience. The neurologist's appointment may take a few weeks to secure, given their busy schedule. As for the results, it will depend on the laboratory and the neurologist's assessment. However, I will follow up with you within two weeks to discuss the preliminary findings. Do you understand these instructions, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Blood tests, sleep study, and a neurologist… it’s a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough, even if it’s… unsettling. Should I contact Dr. Ramirez, my primary care doctor, to let her know about all this? Would that be helpful? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any lifestyle changes or anything? I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is… debilitating.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do inform Dr. Ramirez. Coordinating care is always optimal. In the meantime, maintain a regular sleep schedule, prioritize a healthy diet, and engage in moderate exercise as tolerated. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption. And, perhaps most importantly, manage your stress levels. However, do not self-diagnose or engage in excessive internet research, as that can only exacerbate your anxiety. I believe that concludes our consultation for today, Mr. Paske. If you have any urgent concerns, please contact my office immediately. I expect to hear from you within two weeks regarding the test results. Have a good day. .
