DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my family. Lots of… problems with hearts, you see? My mother, she… she had a bad heart. And my brother, he had trouble too. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises, you know? I’m getting older.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems. We’ll definitely look into that. To get a better picture of things, let’s start with you. Have you been experiencing any symptoms yourself – anything at all that feels off, like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or maybe even just unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing bad. I get… tired sometimes, but I work hard. Sales is… it keeps you going. And sometimes my chest feels… funny. Not pain, exactly. More like… a squeeze. But it doesn’t last long. Happens when I’m walking up hills, maybe. Or after I’ve been talking a lot. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeeze that happens with exertion – that's good information. It’s worth investigating, even if it doesn’t feel like a major problem. We want to rule things out. Just to be thorough, can you describe that “funny” feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. It’s not sharp. More like… pressure. Like someone is… hugging my chest tight. For just a few seconds. Then it goes away. I can still walk, still talk. It doesn’t stop me. But it makes me… think. I don’t want it to get worse, you know? And I sometimes feel… a little out of breath after I climb the stairs. My house has a lot of stairs.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're paying attention to these changes and bringing them to my attention. It’s always better to investigate something early. Now, aside from the chest sensation and occasional shortness of breath, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My ankles… they sometimes swell up a little at the end of the day. Not bad swelling, but you can see them. And I have to go to the bathroom… a lot. Especially at night. My wife… well, my ex-wife… she used to complain I was always getting up. Is that… connected?
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling and frequent urination, especially at night – those are both helpful pieces of the puzzle. It could be connected, yes. It's too early to say for sure, but those symptoms can sometimes be related to heart or kidney issues, or even other things. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I went to the doctor when I was younger, when I had to get shots. And for check-ups, but they always said I was… fine. Just a little too heavy, they said. I try to eat okay, but… sales trips, you know? Lots of restaurants. I don't remember them ever saying anything serious. I have Medicare now, so they check things, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major diagnoses that you're aware of. That's good to know. And you've had regular check-ups in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree, but that’s it. Just a cast. Nothing… big.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Let's move on to your family history. You mentioned your mother and brother had heart problems. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother… she had trouble breathing. She got very tired. They said it was her heart. She was in the hospital a lot, near the end. She died… when I was maybe twenty. It was… a long time ago. My brother… he had chest pain, like I said. They put a… a tube in his leg. To open up his… his pipes, he said. He’s still alive, but he gets tired easily. He doesn't do much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful information. So, your mother had heart problems leading to hospitalization and ultimately passing away, and your brother had chest pain and underwent a procedure to open up blocked arteries. That strengthens the reason to investigate this further. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. Makes me cough just thinking about it. My wife… my ex-wife… she smoked for a while, but she quit. It gave her a bad cough too.
DOCTOR: Good to know. What about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… drink sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a beer when I’m watching the game. Not a lot. I don’t drink every day. It slows me down, you see? Sales… you gotta be quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one. For my… my water. The doctor said my kidneys weren’t working perfect. So I take a little pill every day. A white one. I think it helps me… go to the bathroom. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, one medication for your kidneys. That's good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know… am I okay? That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. I hear a normal heart rhythm, but there's a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we’ll want to investigate it further. Your lungs sound clear. I notice some mild swelling in both ankles, as you mentioned. Now, I’m going to feel your pulses in your feet. Pulses are present and regular, but a bit weak. Based on what you’ve told me and this initial exam, there are a few things we need to look into further to determine the cause of your symptoms. I recommend some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out other potential problems. I also think an EKG would be a good idea to assess your heart’s electrical activity. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Yes, I guess so. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't want any surprises. Can you… tell me what these tests do? Just so I know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concern. The blood work will give us a snapshot of how your kidneys are functioning, your cholesterol levels, which can contribute to heart disease, and other important indicators of your overall health. The EKG is a quick, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It can help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of a previous heart attack. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. We’ll just place some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Stickers… okay. And blood… I don’t like needles, but… if you need it. So, what happens after the tests? How long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. After the tests, the results will typically be available in a few days – usually within 3-5 business days. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If something is wrong, the next steps will depend on the specific findings. It could range from lifestyle changes and medication to further testing or a referral to a specialist, such as a cardiologist – a heart doctor. We will discuss all of your options and create a plan together. I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly along the way. We’ll address any concerns you have. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. Is there a convenient time for you to come back to the clinic for the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… good. Tuesday is okay. I don’t have sales meetings on Tuesday mornings. Can I eat breakfast before?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can eat breakfast before the tests. It won't affect the results. However, please avoid caffeine on the morning of the EKG, as it can sometimes interfere with the readings. Let's schedule you for Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM. We'll do both the blood work and the EKG then. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel… a little better now, just knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. If anything changes or you have any new symptoms before Tuesday, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll see you then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
