DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on… a long time now, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that enough to start with?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a perfect place to start. “Always tired” can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to narrow it down a bit. When you say “long time,” would you estimate weeks, months, or even longer than that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… longer than months, definitely. Maybe… years? It’s really hard to pinpoint. My husband… he passed away a few years back, and things… haven’t been the same since. I guess it started around then, but honestly, it all kind of blends together. I just… don’t have much energy for anything.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s completely understandable that things haven’t been the same since then, and grief can certainly manifest in many ways, including fatigue. We’ll definitely keep that in mind as we explore this. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s not just being sleepy, you know? It’s like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of bed. And then I’ll be up for a little while, doing something… simple, like washing dishes… and then just boom. I feel completely drained. Like all the energy just… vanished. It’s… frustrating, honestly. And sometimes… I just feel… foggy. Like I can't think straight.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Ms. Licano, and I can understand your frustration. It's helpful to know it's not just sleepiness, but this feeling of depletion even with simple activities, and the mental fog. Let's try to get a bit more detail. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no fatigue at all and 10 being the worst fatigue you can imagine, what would you rate your average fatigue level throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a scale… Hmm. Most days? I’d say… a 7, maybe an 8. Some days are worse, you know? Like I can barely function. And then… sometimes it dips a little, but it never really goes below a 6. It's just… always there. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good sense of the consistent nature of this fatigue. And you're right, a constant 7 or 8 is significant. Now, are there any other symptoms that seem to come along with this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache, a little. Not terrible, just… a dull ache. And… I’ve been forgetting things more and more lately. Little things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was going to say… It’s embarrassing, really. And… I don’t really have much of an appetite anymore. Everything just… tastes bland.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches, increasing forgetfulness, and a decreased appetite. Those are all important things to note. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, actually. I think I’ve lost a bit of weight. Not a lot, but my clothes feel looser. I haven't really been trying, though. I just… haven't been eating much, like I said. It's probably just from that, I guess. I don’t really weigh myself often.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss along with the decreased appetite. That’s another piece of the puzzle. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but I was on medication for it. The doctor said it was under control. And… I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Other than that… not really. I don’t think so. My memory isn't the best, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the high blood pressure and the gallbladder removal. Are you currently taking any medications, other than what you took for the blood pressure – even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… um… just a little something for my knees sometimes. They bother me when the weather changes. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was a little low. That’s it, I think. Honestly, I try to take as little as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a vitamin D supplement. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about it, but… I haven't had any problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of conditions like diabetes, heart disease, thyroid problems, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… That's a tough one. My mother… she had some heart trouble when she got older. And… my brother had diabetes, I think. But… it was a long time ago, and I don't really remember all the details. My family wasn’t really one for talking about medical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother. That's helpful to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh… social history? What does that mean? I mostly just stay home now. I don’t really go out much. My husband… he was the social one. Since he passed… it’s just been me. I have a few friends I talk to on the phone sometimes, but… that’s about it. I don't smoke or drink. Never have.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Licano. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s understandable that you’re focusing on taking things one day at a time. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and do a quick neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I guess so. Sounds… alright. Just… don't take too long, please? I have a few things I need to get done this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, Ms. Licano. Everything sounds reasonably normal, though your thyroid is a little enlarged. I noted some mild difficulty with your immediate recall just now, which is consistent with what you’ve mentioned about forgetting things. I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests to investigate this further. I’d like to check your thyroid function, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and your vitamin D level. We should also test for B12 deficiency. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of tests. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I just want to feel better. So… yes, go ahead with the tests.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. Feeling better is the most important thing, and these tests will give us a better picture of what’s going on. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. I'll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave today. In the meantime, I want you to keep a log of your energy levels throughout the day. Just jot down a quick note about how you're feeling at different times of the day, and whether anything seems to make it better or worse. That will be helpful when we discuss the results. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… a log? Alright, I suppose I can do that. It’s just… I’m not very good at remembering things, you know? But I’ll try. I’ll try my best. Is there… is there anything else I need to do? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: That’s all for now, Ms. Licano. Just focus on keeping that log, and try not to worry too much. We'll go over everything once the results are back. The nurse will explain the process for scheduling a follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you listening. I just hope we can figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand your concern, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment.
