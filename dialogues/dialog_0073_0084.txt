DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not like, a fast shortness of breath, just… like there isn't enough air. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It's been going on for a little while now, but it feels worse lately. I don’t… I don’t really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Not enough air,” you say. And dry mouth and eyes… right. And you mentioned this has been going on for “a little while,” but you’re unsure of the exact timeframe. Can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… That is difficult. I wish I could tell you. Perhaps… a few months? Maybe longer. It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… well, like today. I honestly can’t pinpoint a start date. It's frustrating, I know. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, yes. Well, let's try to work around that. Do you notice anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don't think so. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I do. I’ve been trying to pay attention. Being outside doesn’t make it worse, and neither does being inside. Lying down, sitting up… it's all the same, really. I've been drinking plenty of water, trying to help with the dryness, but it doesn’t seem to do much good. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Interesting. No clear triggers, and hydration isn’t helping… Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the shortness of breath and dryness?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, I don't believe so. No cough. My heart doesn’t race, and I haven't noticed any swelling in my ankles. I… I feel a little tired sometimes, but I always chalk that up to… well, life. I suppose. It’s hard to say if that’s related. I don’t think so, but I could be wrong. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I’m trying to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no cough, no swelling. Just fatigue that may or may not be connected… Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question, too. I… I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts as a condition? Seriously though, I don’t think so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, I believe. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I don’t regularly see a doctor, so I wouldn’t necessarily know if I had something undiagnosed. I have private insurance, thankfully, but I haven't needed to use it much. Does that make sense? I apologize for being so… scattered.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses are not what I meant, Ms. Kobler. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, allergies, or any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh! My apologies, Doctor. You are absolutely right to ask for clarification. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with asthma or allergies. I don’t think I’ve ever had any chronic conditions. I've never had any serious surgeries or been hospitalized for anything, either. I really haven't. I'm trying to remember everything, but it's… difficult. Is it alright if I pause for a moment? I feel a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to family history then. Are your parents or siblings living?
PATIENT: Yes, my mother is still living. She's… quite well, actually, for her age. She lives in Anchorage. My father passed away several years ago. He… he had some heart trouble, I believe. Not a sudden thing, but a slow decline. I don’t know much about his medical history, to be honest. We weren’t very close. I have a brother, but I haven’t spoken to him in years. I don't know anything about his health either. I apologize again for being so unhelpful. It feels like I’m failing at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father with heart trouble, limited information on mother and brother. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… I'm divorced, as I mentioned before. I work as a writer – mostly short stories and poems. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I don't use any recreational drugs. I live alone. I mostly keep to myself, to be honest. It’s a quiet life. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I just want to make sure I provide you with the information you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, no alcohol or drug use, lives alone, quiet life... Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I haven’t taken much, thankfully. Just the usual things for colds and headaches. I don't have any food allergies, either. I’m not allergic to bee stings or anything like that. I’m pretty sure, anyway. I haven’t encountered anything I’m allergic to, thankfully. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Let's proceed with a physical exam, then. Could you please sit up and I will listen to your lungs and heart?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever I can to help. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I'm a little nervous, but I trust your expertise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, especially in the lower lobes. No wheezing or crackles noted at this time. Heart rate is regular, but a bit rapid at 92 beats per minute. No murmurs or gallops auscultated. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Reflexes are normal and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Overall, the exam is fairly unremarkable, but the diminished lung sounds are concerning.
PATIENT: Diminished lung sounds… Concerning, you say? I… I see. Is that serious, Doctor? What could be causing that? I’m a little frightened, to be honest. I’ve never had any lung problems before. Could it be the dryness? Or… something else? Is there anything I should be worried about? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m just trying to understand.
DOCTOR: The diminished lung sounds could indicate a number of things, Ms. Kobler. It could be due to mild inflammation, early stages of pneumonia, or even something as simple as dehydration, although the dryness alone wouldn’t typically cause diminished sounds. To rule out anything serious, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and a blood test? Yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I… I’m not particularly fond of needles, but I understand it’s necessary. Will the X-ray show everything? What are we looking for, exactly? And… will I get the results right away? I’m a little worried about what they might find. I hope it's nothing serious. Please, just tell me what to expect. I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any potential abnormalities, such as pneumonia, fluid buildup, or masses. The blood test will help us assess for infection and inflammation. It will take a few hours to get the results back, and then we can discuss them and formulate a plan. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray for you now. In the meantime, try to remain calm. We will get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay. A few hours… remain calm… Yes, alright. I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I… I suppose I’ll just wait here until the nurse comes, then? Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? Perhaps drink more water?
DOCTOR: Yes, drinking more water wouldn't hurt. Otherwise, just try to relax. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
