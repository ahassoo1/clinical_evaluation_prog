DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Chanz Redfern. Though, honestly, names… they all kinda blur together after a while, don't they? You got a nice clinic here, by the way. Suburbs suit you.
DOCTOR: It's… adequate. Look, I'm a busy man. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, busy. Me too. Well, to be frank, I’m just… not sleeping. And when I do sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. It's affecting my work, you know? Fine instruments don’t tune themselves. And frankly, I’m starting to look a bit… gaunt. Though, that might just be the lighting in my workshop. Medicare sent a leaflet, said I should get it checked. Sleep quality and… fitness, was it? Seemed sensible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: So, insomnia. And… fatigue. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Insomnia, yeah, that sounds about right. Honestly? It’s hard to say when it started exactly. Things have been… hazy, the last few years. Probably… six months, maybe? Longer? It's all a bit of a blur, like I said. Definitely getting worse lately, though. I used to be able to power through on coffee, but that doesn’t seem to be doing it anymore. You understand, right? Some things just… wear you down.
DOCTOR: Six months of… vague fatigue. And difficulty sleeping. Right. Do you have any idea why you might not be sleeping?
PATIENT: Why? Honestly, doc, if I knew why, I wouldn’t be here wasting your time. Look, I work long hours. It’s a demanding job, delicate work. Sometimes I’m stressed about a particularly tricky restoration, a valuable violin, you know? But it's not like I haven’t handled stress before. It’s just… different now. I don’t worry more, I just… can't switch off. And my wife… well, that’s another story, isn't it? Though, I doubt that's something you need to hear about. Is this clinic air-conditioned? It’s a bit stuffy in here.
DOCTOR: Let's stick to the medical issues, please. We can address stress, but we need to quantify it. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Quantify it? What do you want, a stress score? Look, I'm a craftsman, not a statistician. Other symptoms… hmm. I get a bit… irritable, I suppose. Snappy with customers, which is bad for business. And my appetite's gone a bit. Not that I have much time for proper meals, anyway. Mostly just coffee and the occasional biscuit. And my hands… they ache sometimes. But that’s just from the work, surely. They always ache. It's a demanding trade. Don't know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: Irritability, decreased appetite, hand pain…and continued fatigue. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just routine. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at those hands. Can you roll up your sleeves?
PATIENT: Roll up my sleeves? Alright, fine. Don't expect miracles, though. They're craftsman's hands, not athlete's hands. Honestly, I’m not sure what good poking and prodding will do. You won’t find the problem in my pulse, I can guarantee you. It’s… something else, I’m telling you. Something deeper. It’s just… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… normal. Lungs are clear. Hands… significant calluses, as expected. Some old scarring. Any recent injuries?
PATIENT: Recent injuries? No, not really. Those scars are… old work, mostly. Little slips of the chisel, you know? A bit of a nick here and there. Nothing serious. Though, I did knock my hand against the workbench a few weeks ago. Just a bruise. Went away after a few days. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, doc, you're looking very focused. Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous. A fine instrument needs a calm hand, and a calm tuner.
DOCTOR: No obvious acute injury. Your reflexes are… normal. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Hmm. Well, I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. Doc said it was “borderline,” I think. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t seem to make much difference, and I didn't like the way they made me feel. Besides, I’m a practical man. I manage. I don’t need to be coddled by pills. As for anything else… not that I recall. My wife… she handled all the paperwork, always. Everything went a bit… hazy after she passed, you understand? It’s all a bit of a blur. Honestly, doc, you’re starting to sound like a… a statistician. I came here for a bit of help sleeping, not a life review.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history? My father... he had a bad heart, I think. Died young. Sudden thing. Mother was always frail, lots of… complaints. Nothing specific, just… old age, I suppose. Lots of aches and pains, like I said. I don’t really pay much attention to family history. It’s… in the past, isn’t it? Doesn't change anything now. And frankly, I'm not one for dwelling on things. It's a… counterproductive habit. You're really digging, doc. Is this standard procedure? I'm starting to feel like a specimen.
DOCTOR: Social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean, "social"? I work. I repair instruments. Sometimes I have a cup of tea with the old man down the street. That’s about it. I used to… well, that doesn't matter now. My wife… she liked to go to the theatre. I tolerated it. Not much of a social creature, I’m afraid. And frankly, I don't see the point of filling out life stories for a doctor. I came here with a simple complaint: I can’t sleep. Is there a solution to that, or are we just going to catalogue my entire existence?
DOCTOR: Alright. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. Dust, maybe? Workshop's full of it. Sometimes I sneeze a bit, but that’s just… dust. Never had any serious reactions. No rashes, no breathing problems, no swelling. Just… dust. Honestly, doc, are we getting anywhere with this? I feel like I’m being interrogated. I'm a craftsman, not a medical marvel. I need sleep, not a life audit.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: I told you, no! I stopped taking those blood pressure pills years ago. I don't like being reliant on things. And no, I don't take anything else. Not even aspirin. I’m a practical man, remember? I deal with things myself. Honestly, doc, you're asking the same questions over and over. It’s… frustrating. Is this some kind of test? Are you trying to see if I'm… senile? Because frankly, that’s a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Redfern, I'm trying to get a complete picture of your health. Your vague recollections and… resistance to providing information are not helping. However… based on what you have told me – insomnia, fatigue, irritability, decreased appetite, and a history of borderline hypertension – it could be a number of things. Stress, obviously. Perhaps some mild depression. It's too early to say definitively. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. That will give us a better baseline. I also recommend a sleep study.
PATIENT: A sleep study? You want me to… sleep in a lab? Surrounded by wires and… and people watching me? That sounds… dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. Look, I appreciate your… thoroughness, I suppose. But I’m not sure this is going to be helpful. Frankly, it sounds like a waste of time and money. And frankly, I have instruments to repair. Delicate, valuable instruments. They need my attention. As for the blood work… fine. I’ll do the blood work. But I’m not promising anything about this sleep study. It sounds… invasive. And frankly, I’m a craftsman, not a laboratory specimen.
DOCTOR: The order is here. You’ll need to schedule an appointment with the lab. As for the sleep study… it’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of your insomnia. I strongly recommend it. But, fine. We can try a low-dose anti-depressant, something to help with sleep and mood, and see if that makes a difference. I'll write a prescription. But understand this – if that doesn’t work, you need to reconsider the sleep study. I'm going to tell you to follow up in two weeks. If you haven't scheduled that sleep study by then, I'm going to refer you to a psychiatrist. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A psychiatrist? You want to send me to a… head doctor? Look, I’m not crazy. I’m just… tired. And irritable. And I can’t sleep. This is getting ridiculous. Fine. I’ll do the blood work. I’ll consider the sleep study. But I’m not promising anything. And I certainly don't want to see a psychiatrist. Two weeks, you say? Very well. Two weeks. But frankly, I’m starting to think this visit was a waste of my time. Is that it? Can I go now? I have instruments to repair. Delicate, valuable instruments. They’re waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. Just… schedule the blood work. And think about the sleep study. .
