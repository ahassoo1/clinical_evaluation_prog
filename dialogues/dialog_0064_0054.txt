DOCTOR: Good morning, Rayshon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... cough, mostly. Been coughing for... a long time, I think. And feel tired a lot. Also, my nose gets blocked up... like, infections, maybe? I don't really know. It happens often.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough, fatigue, and a frequently blocked nose… sounds frustrating. “A long time” is a bit vague, if you don't mind me asking, could you try to recall roughly when this cough started?
PATIENT: Hmm... when did it start? That's... hard. Maybe... last year? Or before? I work a lot, with tires... maybe the dust? It's always there, you know. I forget things easily, sorry. It's not a sharp memory, Doctor. I just... cough a lot.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Rayshon. It's perfectly alright. Memories can be tricky. Last year or before gives us a starting point. And yes, working with tires and dust exposure is definitely something to consider. So, this cough… is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh... I think... sometimes wet. Sometimes dry. Depends. When I wake up in the morning, usually more... stuff coming up. Like... phlegm? Is that what it's called? And then later in the day, more dry. It's... different. Hard to explain, sorry.
DOCTOR: “Phlegm” is exactly right. That's very helpful. So, it sounds like it's worse in the mornings, and you're bringing up some mucus then. Does the mucus have any color to it – white, yellow, green, or even blood-tinged?
PATIENT: Color... hmm. I haven't really looked, to be honest. I just... cough it up and... wipe it away. Usually it's... white, I think? Or maybe a bit yellow sometimes. I don't know. I don't pay attention to the color. Sorry. I just want the coughing to stop. It's tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright, don’t worry about paying attention to the color if it’s unpleasant. White or yellowish mucus is fairly common with a cold or mild irritation. Now, besides the cough and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... let me think. My head feels stuffy a lot. Like, pressure in my nose and forehead. And sometimes... a bit of a fever, maybe? Not high, but... warm. My wife says I look flushed. I don't really check my temperature. Does that count? And...sometimes I feel a bit achy all over. Like after a hard day at work, but...not as bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy head with pressure, occasional low-grade fever, and some body aches… That paints a clearer picture. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... not really. I get tired, but I work hard all day. So I just thought that was... normal tired. Chest pain... no, not really. Sometimes it feels a bit tight, like... after coughing a lot, but not pain. Just uncomfortable. It doesn't hurt to breathe. I think. It’s hard to tell, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant shortness of breath or chest pain, just some tightness after coughing. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – like asthma, bronchitis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh... not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups, I think. Nothing serious. My wife usually handles all that stuff. She'd know if I had something. I just... work. And cough. I don't think I have anything bad. I just feel tired and blocky all the time. Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: “Blocky” - I understand what you mean. Feeling congested and blocked up is certainly a thing. It's alright that you haven't been to the doctor much. We'll figure things out. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I try to avoid doctors. Work is important. I can't afford to be sick. I just... keep going. My wife gets mad at me sometimes for not taking care of myself. She worries a lot. But I’m okay. Mostly. Just tired and blocky. And coughing. A lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father... he had... something with his heart, I think. He was old. And my mother... she had diabetes, I think. She needed medicine for it. But that was a long time ago. I don't really know much about it. We don't talk about those things much in my family. It's… bad luck to talk about sickness. Is that weird? My wife knows more about all that stuff.
DOCTOR: No, it's not weird at all, Rayshon. Some families prefer not to dwell on medical history. Knowing about your father's heart condition and your mother's diabetes is helpful, though. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoked. My wife doesn’t like smoking. She says it’s bad for your health. I drink... sometimes. A little bit of beer with dinner. Not much. I work hard all day, I don't really have time for much else. And I need sleep. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional beer, and prioritizing sleep – good. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife cooks everything. Sometimes I get a bit of a stuffy nose, but I just thought that was the dust from work. I don’t take much medicine. Just pain killers sometimes, for my back. It gets sore from lifting tires all day. But I haven't had any bad reactions to those. Is that what you mean? I just... don’t get sick much. Or at least, I don’t notice it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Rayshon. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your lungs and check your throat. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s alright. Just... quick, please? I need to get back to work. Tires are waiting. And my wife will be worried. But yeah, you can listen to my lungs. I cough a lot, so you’ll probably hear something. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is bad, Rayshon. It just gives us more information. If you could just sit here for me, and I’ll listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Deep breaths in and out, please. Okay… I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. It’s not severe, but it's there. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit – slightly elevated, but not significantly. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might have bronchitis, possibly triggered by your work environment and dust exposure. The wheezing in your lungs and red throat support that. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to get a chest X-ray. Would you be able to go to the imaging center down the street?
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Is that bad? I just thought it was...a bad cough. X-ray? Is that expensive? I don’t have much money. My wife…she’ll be worried. And the tires…they’re waiting. Can’t I just take some medicine? Like cough syrup or something? I really need to get back to work. Is there anything I can do right now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Rayshon. Bronchitis can be uncomfortable, but it's usually not serious, especially if we catch it early. The X-ray will just help us rule out anything else that might be causing your symptoms, like pneumonia. Regarding cost, let me see what resources are available. There is a program that can help cover the cost of the X-ray, since you’re uninsured. It's not a full cover, but it significantly reduces the price. It might be around $75 with the assistance. In the meantime, to help relieve your symptoms, I can prescribe an albuterol inhaler. It helps open up your airways and make breathing easier. It's not a cure, but it will provide some immediate relief. And I can also recommend a cough suppressant to help with the coughing. Would you like me to write those prescriptions for you?
PATIENT: $75… okay. That’s… manageable. My wife will probably be mad I even went to the doctor, but…$75 is okay. An inhaler…and cough syrup? Will that let me get back to work? I really need to get back to work. The tires…and my wife…she’s depending on me. Yeah, please write the prescriptions. The inhaler and the cough syrup. And...thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Even if it means $75. My wife…she’ll be happy I’m trying to get better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. I’m glad I could help. Here are the prescriptions for the albuterol inhaler and the cough suppressant. The inhaler will need to be used as directed, usually two puffs every four to six hours as needed. The cough suppressant is to help with the nighttime coughing. I’m also going to write you a note for work, explaining that you've been seen by a doctor and are being treated for bronchitis. It won’t excuse you from all work duties, but it might help if you need to take a few breaks. And, to be on the safe side, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to see how you’re responding to the treatment. If your symptoms worsen before then – such as difficulty breathing, high fever, or chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… high fever… I’ll remember that. Emergency room. Okay. One week… I’ll try to come back. Work is… busy. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just…the inhaler and the cough syrup. And the note for work. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… $75. I’ll tell my wife. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And please, take care of yourself. It's important. One last thing – I’m going to recommend that you try to limit your exposure to dust at work as much as possible. If you can wear a mask, that would be helpful. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
