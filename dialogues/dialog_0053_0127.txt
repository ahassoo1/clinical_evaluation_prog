DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been feeling weaker, gradually, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s not terribly comfortable, and I’m starting to get concerned about what it could be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness and drooping eyelids… alright. And when you say weakness, can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… it’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Like, carrying groceries is becoming more difficult, and I get tired much faster when I’m walking. It started subtly, but it’s definitely noticeable now. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s just… progressively getting worse. I haven’t really noticed it affecting anything else yet, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long ago would you say this started – this progressive weakness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly… I’d say maybe… six, seven months ago? It began so gradually, you see. I just sort of chalked it up to being a bit out of shape after the divorce, truthfully. But it hasn't gotten better, and if anything, it's been worsening the last couple of months. That's when I really started to worry.
DOCTOR: Divorce is stressful, certainly. Okay, six to seven months. Any trouble with your vision, double vision, or blurry vision at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My vision seems perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. No blurry vision, no double vision, nothing like that. It’s just… the weakness, and the eyelids. That's all. I did notice my speech feels a little slurred sometimes at the end of the day, but I thought that was just fatigue.
DOCTOR: A little slurred speech… alright. And has anyone else noticed this – the weakness or the speech?
PATIENT: My ex-wife… she mentioned the eyelids a few times, yes. Said I looked… tired. She didn't say anything about the weakness, but she hasn’t been around much, so… I doubt she’d have noticed. My mother called last week and commented I sounded a bit… 'flat' on the phone, which is probably the speech thing. But nobody has directly said anything about me being weak, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any trouble swallowing, or has your voice changed at all?
PATIENT: No trouble swallowing, thankfully. Everything goes down normally. And my voice… I don’t think it’s changed. It might be a bit quieter than usual, but I thought that was just… me being tired. It’s hard to say, honestly. I haven't really paid much attention to it, to be perfectly frank. I'm not sure what would constitute a change, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Okay. Let’s move on to some other things, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a child, of course, but nothing serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries… I broke my arm when I was eight, fell out of a tree, but that was just a simple fracture. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. That's why this is so unsettling, to be honest. I’m not the type to be… sick.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a bit tricky. My mother is still alive and relatively healthy, though she has some arthritis. My father passed away when I was quite young, from a heart attack. And… my grandmother, on my mother's side, she had something… some kind of muscle problem, I think? But it was a long time ago, and my mother doesn’t talk about it much. I don't know the specifics, I'm afraid. It wasn't anything… contagious, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never have. I’m not a smoker, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that – and I’ve never touched drugs. I'm really not much of a partier, truthfully. I prefer quiet evenings at home. I suppose that helps with the health, if nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any medications. I tried a multivitamin for a bit last year, but I stopped. I didn’t really notice any difference, so… what’s the point, really? I prefer to get my nutrients from food. I try to eat a healthy diet, as much as I can. Though, with everything going on, it’s been difficult to keep up lately.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, thankfully. I’ve never had any trouble with hay fever or anything like that either. I suppose I'm quite lucky, in that regard. Though, with everything else, I’m starting to wonder how much longer that luck will last.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Then I'll take a look in your eyes and listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. I’m a little nervous, truthfully, but I’ll cooperate however I can. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go. I'll try my best. Is that alright? I didn’t want to squeeze too hard.
DOCTOR: Good. And now the other hand. Okay, good strength in both hands. Now, could you push against my hands with your feet, like you're trying to push something away?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Like this? Is that sufficient? It feels a little… odd, being tested like this. But I’ll do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little surprising. And the other side… Hmm. Not quite what I'd expect.
PATIENT: Not quite what you'd expect? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I was a little startled, to be honest. It didn’t hurt, but it wasn’t particularly pleasant either. What did you see? Please, Doctor, you’re making me anxious now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, try to remain calm. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger. Follow my finger… and look to the left… and look to the right… now up… and down… Hmm. And I do note some drooping of your eyelids. More pronounced on one side.
PATIENT: Alright, I’m following it. Left… right… up… down… It feels a bit strange, having someone stare at my eyes like that. Is it… obvious about the eyelids? I can feel them, of course, but I wasn't sure how noticeable it was. What does it all mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? You’re not telling me something, are you?
DOCTOR: No, I’m not withholding anything, Mr. Schaust. However, I need to gather more information before I can give you a definitive answer. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed in the exam - the weakness, the diminished reflexes, the drooping eyelids, the slurred speech - my initial concern is something affecting your nerves and muscles. Several possibilities exist. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a check for certain antibodies and markers of muscle inflammation. I also want to get an MRI of your brain and neck to rule out any structural issues. It's important to determine the cause of these symptoms. I want to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an MRI? That sounds… serious. Nerves and muscles… Is it… is it something like… Multiple Sclerosis? Or… Muscular Dystrophy? I’ve read things online… and those were the things that came up. Honestly, Doctor, you’re frightening me now. So, you don't know what it is? It could be… a lot of things? And the tests are to figure out which of those things it is? I understand you need to be thorough, of course, but… this is very unsettling. Will the tests take long? And what happens if it is something… serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, it's understandable that you're frightened. You're right to ask questions, and I want to be as transparent as possible. Those conditions – Multiple Sclerosis and Muscular Dystrophy – are possibilities we need to rule in or out. But it could be something else entirely. There are many conditions that can cause similar symptoms, and jumping to conclusions before we have the results of the tests would be irresponsible. The blood tests should be processed within a few days, and the MRI scheduling will take a bit longer – likely a week or so to get an appointment. And regarding what happens if it is something serious… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If we find something, we’ll discuss all your treatment options, and I’ll refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders – for further care. We will manage it together, step by step. I’m also going to order a referral to a speech therapist. They can assess the degree of your slurred speech and provide exercises if needed. For now, avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral?
PATIENT: A neurologist… right. That sounds… complicated. And a speech therapist… I didn’t think it was that noticeable. Okay… tests and a neurologist. I think I understand. What kind of complications could the tests have? Will they involve needles? I’m… not a fan of needles, to be honest. And how long will the MRI take? Will it be… claustrophobic? I’ve heard things about MRIs being… enclosed. I suppose… I suppose I just need to know what to expect. And… what if it is something bad? Will I… will I need to go to the hospital? This is all very frightening, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things, but… it’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, let’s address your concerns one by one. The blood tests will involve a standard blood draw – yes, a needle, but it’s quick and usually not too painful. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can make you comfortable. The MRI involves lying in a large, enclosed tube. It can be a bit unsettling if you're prone to claustrophobia, but it’s not completely enclosed - you'll have a clear view at both ends. We can give you a mild sedative to help you relax if needed. The scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes, and you’ll be able to communicate with the technician throughout the process. Regarding what if it is something bad… we’ll manage it. Many conditions are treatable, and even if a cure isn’t possible, we can focus on managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life. In most cases, hospitalization wouldn’t be necessary immediately, but it depends on the specific diagnosis and severity of the condition. I want to reassure you that we’re taking all the necessary steps to determine what’s going on. I’ll be with you every step of the way. I’m also going to give you a written list of the tests, the referral information, and some resources to help you cope with the uncertainty. Do you want me to explain the potential cost of these tests and what options you have for payment?
PATIENT: Okay… a sedative for the MRI… that sounds… helpful. And the written list… that would be good. I always feel better when things are… documented. And yes, please, the cost information would be appreciated. I… I don’t have insurance, unfortunately. I’m divorced, as I mentioned, and… it’s complicated. I just… I just want to know what I’m facing. And how much it’s going to cost. And… what happens if I can’t afford it. I’m a little overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s a lot to take in, and… and the uncertainty is the worst part. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I think… I think that’s all for now. I just need to… process everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. I’m here to help in any way I can. Here’s the list of tests, the referral information, and a breakdown of the potential costs. I’ve also included some information about financial assistance programs and local resources for uninsured patients. I’ll also have my office staff contact you to schedule the blood tests and the MRI. They can answer any questions you have about the process and help you navigate the financial aspects. I want you to know that we’ll do everything we can to get you the care you need, regardless of your insurance status. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re in this together. I’ll see you back in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. Take care, Mr. Schaust.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I… I appreciate your kindness.
