DOCTOR: Right. Denis Minatra, 67. And you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Sink. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding the results of a… a test I had done on my stomach. The results were… unusual, the letter said. I’m hoping you can explain them to me. I’m a little worried, naturally.
DOCTOR: “Unusual,” is a… broad term. And letters aren't exactly my specialty. Let's try to be specific. What kind of test was it?
PATIENT: It was… an endoscopy, I believe. They sent a little camera down my throat. It wasn’t very pleasant, but the nurse was quite kind. They took some… samples, I think, and I received the letter about a week ago. It mentioned something about… well, that’s why I’m here, to be honest. I don’t recall the specific name of the test itself, just that it involved the camera. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: An endoscopy... yes. Alright. And what specifically did the letter say was unusual?
PATIENT: It indicated… inflammation. And some… polyps, I believe the word was. Small ones, it said, but… it recommended I come in for a discussion. I must confess, Doctor, medical terms don't stick with me very well. It did mention something about needing to ensure they weren't…pre-cancerous, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions by reading too much into it myself. That’s why I thought it best to speak with you directly.
DOCTOR: Inflammation and polyps. Well, that narrows it down a bit. Small polyps are… common, honestly. Though inflammation does need investigating. Do you have any pain, Mrs. Minatra?
PATIENT: Not… constant pain, no. Occasionally, yes. A sort of… burning sensation in my upper stomach, particularly after eating. And sometimes a little discomfort, a feeling of fullness even after a small meal. But it's not debilitating, Doctor. It comes and goes. I’ve always had a…sensitive stomach, you could say. But it’s been a bit more frequent these last few months.
DOCTOR: And how long have these symptoms been present?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… the discomfort comes and goes as I said, but the increased frequency, the more noticeable burning… I'd say perhaps three, maybe four months now. It began gradually, and I initially thought it was something I ate. But it hasn’t improved with dietary changes, so… that prompted me to schedule the test. And then the letter arrived.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking anything for it currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t taken anything at all. I prefer to avoid medications if possible, if the issue might resolve itself. I've tried some… herbal teas, chamomile mostly, but they haven’t provided much relief. I was hoping it would pass on its own, but as I mentioned, it's persisted, and now the test results are concerning. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, if it can.
DOCTOR: Chamomile, right. Interesting. Now, let's go through your medical history. Any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Not… significant, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, nothing serious. As an adult, I had a bout of pneumonia some years ago, perhaps fifteen years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… I’ve been quite fortunate, I believe. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I used to be quite active, though my age is beginning to catch up with me, naturally. And my late husband… he was always very careful with his health, and I think some of that rubbed off on me. I don’t recall any major surgeries or chronic conditions.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I don't have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication I’ve taken, which hasn’t been a great deal, thankfully. I recall taking penicillin as a child, but that was many years ago. And… I think that was the only one. I've always been very cautious about taking anything unless absolutely necessary. It's a habit I suppose, instilled by my mother. She was very wary of pharmaceuticals.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: That’s…a difficult question. My family is… was, mostly in Mexico. I haven’t had much contact over the years, and records weren't always kept meticulously. My mother… she passed away when I was young. I believe my father had some heart trouble later in life, but I don't know the specifics. As for cancer… I don’t recall anyone having it directly, though I understand it's becoming more common, unfortunately. It's difficult to say with certainty, Doctor. My family wasn't one for discussing such matters openly. It wasn't considered polite, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Not… ideal. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I’ve never smoked in my life. My late husband, he tried it briefly when he was younger, but he quickly gave it up. He said it didn't agree with him. And I've always found the smell… unpleasant. I believe it’s a very damaging habit. No, I don't smoke. I’ve always been very careful about maintaining my health, as I mentioned. It's important to me, particularly as I grow older.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Very little, Doctor. Just… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps on a special occasion. I don’t drink regularly. My late husband enjoyed a beer now and then, but I’ve never been one for spirits or frequent drinking. It doesn’t appeal to me. I prefer herbal tea, as I mentioned earlier. Perhaps once or twice a month, a small glass of wine. Nothing more than that. I wouldn't say I’m a drinker at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss further. Can you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I’m ready when you are. Though I must warn you, my joints aren't quite as nimble as they used to be. I may need a little assistance getting situated.
DOCTOR: Just lie on your back for now. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen. I need to listen for any unusual sounds. Please relax, and breathe normally. Normal bowel sounds… slightly hypoactive, but not alarmingly so. I’m going to palpate now. Let me know if anything is tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Just a little, Doctor. A mild discomfort. Not sharp pain, but… awareness. It’s been like that for some time, as I said, a general feeling of… fullness, if that makes sense. It’s not a sudden pain, it’s more of a lingering sensation. Is that what you were expecting?
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: A little more noticeable there, Doctor. Up here, under my ribs, on the right side. It’s not excruciating, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It feels…tight, almost. I suppose it’s where I’ve been experiencing the burning sensation. It’s not constant, as I’ve said, but when you press there, I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Liver span…difficult to assess accurately given body habitus, but doesn’t feel significantly enlarged. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs, just to rule things out. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright. Based on your symptoms and the limited exam, it's still unclear what’s causing the discomfort. The endoscopy results of inflammation and polyps are concerning, but not immediately life-threatening. We need to consider several possibilities.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Several possibilities… that does sound rather… unsettling. What are those possibilities, if you don’t mind me asking? Is further testing required? I’m prepared to do whatever is necessary to determine the cause of this discomfort. It’s just… worrying, naturally.
DOCTOR: Well, the inflammation could be caused by gastritis, or an ulcer, or even something like gallbladder disease. The polyps… they could be benign, but we need to rule out dysplasia – which is pre-cancerous changes. The next step is a biopsy of the polyps. And I would like to order a Helicobacter pylori test – it’s a bacteria that can cause ulcers and inflammation. We’ll also run a comprehensive metabolic panel – to check your liver function and other important indicators. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A biopsy… and tests for bacteria, and liver function… That sounds… thorough. And necessary, I suppose. I’m a little worried about the biopsy, naturally. Is it… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? As for the bacteria… is it something I’ve… caught from someone? I apologize, Doctor, I’m asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: The biopsy will involve taking small tissue samples during another endoscopy. It’s usually not painful per se, but uncomfortable. We’ll give you a sedative to help you relax. As for catching the bacteria… it’s often spread through contaminated food or water, or close contact with someone who’s infected, but it’s very common. Many people have it without even knowing. Results usually take about a week, sometimes a little longer. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Are you insured?
PATIENT: Unfortunately, no, Doctor. I’m not insured. My late husband… handled all those arrangements, and… well, things are complicated. I’m relying on my savings. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: That complicates matters. The endoscopy and biopsy… it’s not inexpensive. We have a financial assistance program, but it has limited funds and a lengthy application process. I can connect you with the billing department to discuss payment options. We can also explore alternative testing facilities with lower costs, although the quality may not be the same. Before we proceed, are you experiencing any other symptoms – fever, weight loss, blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. And I haven't noticed any weight loss, although my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. As for blood in my stool… no, not that I’ve noticed. There was…a slight change in color a few weeks ago, darker than usual, but I attributed it to something I ate. Nothing dramatic. And I assure you, Doctor, I have been paying close attention to my body since all this began. It is unsettling, to be experiencing these symptoms.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the lack of red flag symptoms, we can proceed with the diagnostic tests. I’ll put in the orders for the H. pylori test and the comprehensive metabolic panel. I’m also referring you to Dr. Ramirez for the repeat endoscopy and biopsy. She’s very experienced. I will have the billing department contact you about the costs and financial assistance options. We’ll schedule the endoscopy as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience with my questions. It’s… reassuring to know we’re taking a systematic approach. I will await a call from the billing department, and I will schedule the endoscopy with Dr. Ramirez. Thank you, Doctor Sink. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed and the orders for the tests. And a referral to Dr. Ramirez. The nursing staff will escort you to the exit. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any urgent concerns. Next patient. .
