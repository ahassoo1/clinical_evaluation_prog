DOCTOR: Hi Jase, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Condray, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good, for a little while now. Like, a lot of diarrhea. I feel like I’m always running to the bathroom. Honestly, I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It’s just… been happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea for a little while now, and you're finding yourself needing to use the bathroom frequently. That sounds really disruptive. You said you don’t remember exactly when it started – roughly, would you say it’s been a few days, a week, longer than that?
PATIENT: Hmm… longer than a week, definitely. Maybe a month? It comes and goes, but it’s… pretty consistent, if that makes sense. Like, there are some good days, but mostly it’s just… there. It's hard to keep track, honestly. I just know it’s been a while. And it’s getting a bit… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of intermittent diarrhea, with more bad days than good. That is tiring, I can imagine. Are you having any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I've been feeling really tired, just generally run down. And… sometimes my stomach cramps, a lot. Not all the time, but when the diarrhea is bad, for sure. Oh! And I haven't been very hungry lately, which is weird for me. I usually love food.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, stomach cramps that worsen with the diarrhea, and a loss of appetite. That gives me a bit more to work with. When you say cramps, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Um… it's like… a squeezing feeling, mostly in my lower stomach. Not super sharp, more like a really uncomfortable ache. It comes in waves, you know? And it feels worse after I… well, after I use the bathroom. Sometimes it’s just a general ache, even when I don't need to go. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing pains in your lower abdomen, worse after bowel movements, but also present at times even when you're not actively having diarrhea. Have you noticed anything in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um… That's… a bit awkward to talk about, isn't it? Sometimes it's just watery, you know? And other times… there's blood. Not a lot, but enough to notice. It usually just streaks in there, kinda… mixed in. It worries me a bit, obviously. I’m not sure if that’s normal or… anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Jase. It's good that you told me, even though it's uncomfortable to discuss. Seeing blood in your stool is definitely something we need to investigate. Just to be clear, is this bright red blood, or darker, almost black blood?
PATIENT: Bright red, mostly. Sometimes it’s just a little bit, like just a few streaks. Other times it's a bit more, but it’s never… a lot, you know? Definitely bright red though. Not dark at all. And it doesn’t always happen, just… sometimes when the diarrhea is really bad. It’s scary. I get worried something serious is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood with the diarrhea, especially when it's severe. That's important information. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I think so? I remember something about my stomach when I was younger. My mom always said I had a sensitive tummy. I think the doctor said something about… IBD? Or celiac? Something like that. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don’t remember much. We went to a lot of appointments, and I had to avoid certain foods, but… I’ve kind of forgotten a lot of the details. And I haven't been to a doctor regularly in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a sensitive stomach and possible IBD or celiac disease as a child. That's helpful to know. We’ll definitely need to look into that further. Do you happen to know what foods you were avoiding?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s a good question. I think… gluten? Something about wheat and bread. And dairy, maybe? My mom was really strict about what I ate for a while. I remember a lot of rice and… chicken, I think. It was a long time ago, though, and honestly, I mostly just remember being annoyed that I couldn't eat pizza with my friends! I haven't really avoided those foods in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, avoiding gluten and possibly dairy as a child. And you haven’t been following those restrictions recently. Now, let’s quickly go over your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, especially anything related to the stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: Hmm… My dad… he has high blood pressure, I think. And my mom… she always complained about her stomach, actually. Like, a lot of bloating and… just generally not feeling well. She never really went to the doctor about it, though. Just always said she had a “sensitive stomach” like me. And my grandma on my mom’s side… I think she had something wrong with her bowels when she was older, but I don’t remember exactly what.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure, a mother with frequent stomach complaints, and a grandmother with bowel issues. Thank you. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't smoke, I rarely drink, and definitely no drugs. I don’t really like those things. I work a lot, mostly just sales stuff, so I don’t really have much time for anything like that, honestly. I’m married, though. My husband… he’s really supportive, thankfully, with everything. He’s been really worried about me lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. You’re married and work in sales. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take most medications without any problems. I’ve had the usual… like, penicillin as a kid, but nothing serious. Oh! Except… I think I get a little itchy sometimes with certain bandages, but that’s it. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies except for a minor reaction to some bandages. Thank you, Jase. That gives me a pretty good picture. Given your history of possible IBD or celiac disease as a child, the blood in your stool, and the ongoing diarrhea, I want to do a thorough examination and order some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to figure out what's wrong, you know? I'm tired of feeling sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Take some deep breaths for me. Okay, I’m feeling some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. It doesn’t seem to be anything acutely concerning, but it does correlate with your reported pain. I’m also not feeling any masses or significant rigidity. Now, I'm going to order some lab tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool culture to check for infections, and fecal calprotectin to help rule out inflammation in your intestines. I'm also going to order a celiac disease panel to see if that's a possibility. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… good. If it helps figure things out, then yes, please. The tests sound… scary, but if it gets me closer to feeling better, then I’m willing. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it be painful? Like, the stool test?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your anxiety, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. The stool test itself is not painful at all. You’ll just need to collect a small sample, and the lab will analyze it. The blood tests will be a standard draw, and may cause a brief pinch. The lab results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, eating bland foods – things like rice, bananas, and toast – and avoiding anything that seems to trigger your diarrhea. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. 3-5 days… I can manage that. Bland food… I think I can do that. Um… will the tests show if it is celiac? Like, definitely? And… if it is, what does that mean? I don’t really remember much from when I was a kid. I just remember avoiding bread. And… what if it’s not celiac? What else could it be?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Jase. The celiac disease panel is a pretty reliable test, but it’s not foolproof. A negative result doesn’t completely rule it out, but it makes it less likely. If the results are positive, it would strongly suggest celiac disease, and we’d need to confirm with a biopsy of your small intestine. If it is celiac disease, it means your immune system reacts to gluten, damaging your small intestine. The treatment is a strict gluten-free diet for life. It sounds daunting, but there are a lot of resources available to help you manage it. If it’s not celiac disease, there are several other possibilities we’ll consider. These include inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, infections, food intolerances, or even stress-related diarrhea. The lab results will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the next steps. Do you have any family history of Crohn's or Ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… my grandma on my mom’s side, she had something wrong with her bowels when she was older. I don’t remember exactly what, but my mom said it was something chronic. She never really talked about it much. I don’t think anyone else in the family has anything like that. It was just my grandma, and I don’t know much about it, honestly. She passed away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandmother with a chronic bowel issue. That's helpful information, and it does raise the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease. For now, let's focus on getting those lab tests done. I'll give you the lab requisition forms and instructions for collecting the stool sample. The nurse will also go over the instructions with you before you leave. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, once we have the results back. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, high fever, or bloody stools, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Condray. You’ve explained everything really well, and I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on. I’m still worried, but… at least we’re trying to figure it out. I appreciate you taking the time with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I understand your worry, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. Remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse is also an excellent resource, and can address any immediate concerns you may have. I’ll see you in about a week. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and try to stay as comfortable as possible. .
