DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero, and I’m a family medicine physician here. It’s August 2nd, and I see you’re 58 years old. Thank you for choosing us for your care. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit concerning. I’ve been… bruising, quite easily. And I’m on a blood thinner, naturally, so it shouldn’t be happening like this. It’s just… more than it used to be. I bumped my arm yesterday, very lightly, and it turned black and blue immediately. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. Easy bruising, especially while on a blood thinner, definitely warrants investigation. It's good you're bringing this to our attention. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the bruising in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail? It's… purple. Black and blue, like I said. It swells up a bit, but not terribly. It's not like I'm falling down and breaking bones, it’s just… normal bumps. You know, walking into furniture, that sort of thing. It shouldn’t leave a mark like this. Honestly, I'm quite careful. I don't understand why it’s happening now. I’ve been on the same medication for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it's more the extent of the bruising that's concerning, rather than the fact that you're bruising at all, given you’re on a blood thinner. And it's a recent change, you haven’t always bruised this easily even with the medication?
PATIENT: Precisely. It's not that I expect to be completely impervious to anything, but a little knock shouldn’t look like I’ve been in a fight. And no, it wasn’t always this bad. For years, it was… manageable. A small bruise, faded quickly. This is… different. It's been, oh, maybe the last month or so that I've noticed it getting worse. It’s quite unsettling, to be frank. I pride myself on being a careful man.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. A change in bruising pattern is definitely something we need to investigate. Let's start with some background information. Could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Well, I'm a pathologist, Doctor. I know medical history. But you need my history. Let's see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, standard procedure. Nothing else significant. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Otherwise, quite healthy. I exercise regularly, I eat a sensible diet... I can't say I've had many ailments. The biggest issue, truthfully, was losing my wife. That’s been… difficult. But medically speaking, not much to report. And again, this bruising is new. It has to be related to the medication, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Farson, and I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It's important to understand the whole picture. And you are right to question if it's related to the medication, that’s certainly a possibility. Now, regarding the blood thinner, could you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage you are taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… honestly, I leave that to my wife when she handled the refills. She always kept track of everything. I think it’s… Warfarin? Yes, Warfarin. And the dosage… let me think. I believe it's five milligrams, daily. Though, it could be seven. She adjusted it a few times over the years. I really couldn't say with certainty. She always knew, and I trusted her implicitly. I'm afraid I'm not as meticulous with these things as a pathologist might be expected. It’s just a pill I take every day, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It’s perfectly alright, and very common, to leave medication management to a spouse. We can certainly verify the dosage with your pharmacy. Let’s move on to some other questions, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not to my knowledge. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've taken antibiotics, pain relievers, all sorts of things over the years with no issues. I’m quite resilient, actually. I suppose I've been fortunate. No, allergies are not a concern. Though, I despise the smell of certain cleaning products. Does that count? I get a headache, but it’s not an allergy, just… unpleasant. Really, I can’t think of anything. This bruising is the problem. It's so unlike me.
DOCTOR: No, a headache from a cleaning product doesn’t count as an allergy, Mr. Farson. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any bleeding disorders or unusual bruising tendencies that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My father… he was a stoic man, never complained about much. My mother, she was prone to headaches, but nothing serious. As for bleeding disorders… not that I'm aware of. No one ever mentioned anything. We're Guatemalan, you know. Things weren't… openly discussed like they are now. I don’t recall any family members with excessive bleeding or easy bruising. Everyone was fairly… robust. This is why I'm concerned, Doctor. It’s just not normal for me, or my family. It's an anomaly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. That’s helpful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you need to know? I'm a widower, as I mentioned. I live alone. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back isn't what it used to be. I read extensively - medical journals, naturally, but also history and philosophy. I don’t drink alcohol, never have. Never smoked either. I don’t… socialize much these days. It’s just me and my books, mostly. A quiet life. Not a particularly exciting one, but it suits me. I certainly don't engage in any risky behavior that would cause this bruising!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to take a closer look at the bruising on your arm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s unsettling, to be frank. Please, proceed. I'm a bit particular about personal space, if you don't mind, but I understand it's necessary for the examination. Just let me know what you’re doing as you go along.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I understand and will be mindful of your space. I’ll explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, if you’ll please expose your arm, I’d like to examine the bruising. Okay, I see the bruising. It’s approximately 5 centimeters in diameter, and it’s tender to the touch. There’s some swelling, but no signs of any fracture or joint instability. The skin color is a mix of purple and dark blue. I don’t feel any lumps or masses in the area. It appears to be a simple contusion. I’m noting this as a 5x5 cm contusion on the left forearm, tender to palpation, with mixed purple and dark blue discoloration. I also notice a few smaller bruises on your other arm, about 1-2 centimeters in diameter. Are those new as well?
PATIENT: Yes, those smaller ones… I hadn't really paid them much attention, to be honest. But now that you mention it, I think they are new. Maybe the last week or so. They appeared after… I tripped over the rug the other day. Nothing serious, just a slight stumble. But I’m usually much steadier on my feet. And, truthfully, those shouldn't have left a mark like this. It's concerning, Doctor. Very concerning. It feels like I'm falling apart. I'm a pathologist, I understand the body. This isn’t right. Is it… could it be something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson, and it’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried when things aren’t as they should be. Given the recent appearance of multiple bruises, even small ones, and your history of easy bruising while on Warfarin, we need to investigate this further. While it’s possible this is simply a side effect of the medication, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, coagulation studies , and liver function tests. These tests will help us determine if there’s a problem with your blood cells, clotting factors, or liver, which could be contributing to the bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. I trust your judgment. It’s just… all this is unsettling. I’ve always been so careful, so meticulous. And now… I feel like a fragile old man. I suppose that’s just age, isn’t it? But truthfully, it feels like more than that. It feels like something is… wrong. Please, proceed with the tests. And if you could explain the results to me in detail when they come back, I’d appreciate that. I’m a pathologist, remember, I can understand the medical terminology. But I want to hear your interpretation as well.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I completely understand your concerns, and I will explain the results to you in detail. I'll be happy to go through the numbers with you and explain my interpretation. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests. You can go to the lab anytime today. They should have the results back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to falls or injuries. Also, let’s review your medications again to make sure everything is correct. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just the tests, and the explanation of the results. I suppose I should be thankful you’re taking this seriously. Some doctors wouldn’t bother with an old man and a few bruises, would they? But you seem… thorough. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to detail. Just… please, let’s find out what’s wrong. I’m a pathologist, I know the importance of a proper diagnosis. The uncertainty is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Farson. It’s my job to take your concerns seriously, and I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. Your peace of mind is important. I understand your uncertainty is unsettling, and we will work diligently to provide you with a proper diagnosis and a plan. .
