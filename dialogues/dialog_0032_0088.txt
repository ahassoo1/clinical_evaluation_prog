DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 27 years old. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, that’s right. It’s… well, it’s my ears. Been getting this ringing sound, you know? It's pretty annoying.
DOCTOR: I see. Ringing in the ears. And how long has this ringing been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… not too long, maybe a couple of weeks? It comes and goes, but it's definitely been happening for at least that long, I think. Hard to keep track sometimes, to be honest. It’s not constant.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly the left one, I’d say. Sometimes I hear it in the right, but it’s way quieter. It's the left one that really bothers me. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the ringing?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It’s not like a bell, exactly. More like a high-pitched whine, you know? A really faint buzzing, almost. And sometimes it feels like pressure, too, inside my ear. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A high-pitched whine with pressure. Yes, I understand. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Loud noises definitely make it worse. Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking, or music, it gets really bad. Quiet places help a little, but it doesn’t always go away completely. I haven't really noticed anything that makes it better, though.
DOCTOR: Have you been exposed to any particularly loud noises recently?
PATIENT: Not really, not that I can think of. I work at the restaurant, so it’s always a bit noisy, but it’s nothing crazy. No concerts or anything. I mean… there was that one time at the market, a vendor had a really loud speaker system… but that was over a month ago. I don't know if that would still be affecting things.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any issues with your ears before?
PATIENT: No, never. No ear infections or anything like that. This is totally new. I've always had good hearing, as far as I know. It's just… annoying, you know? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look at your ears. I’m going to need to examine them. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Just tell me if I need to do anything. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lean forward slightly. Now, I'm going to gently insert this into your ear canal… there we go. Hmm. The ear canal appears clear. The tympanic membrane… looks slightly erythematous. No visible perforations. Right ear is normal. There's a slight cerumen buildup, but nothing significant. Okay. Your ears do appear a little inflamed, but nothing overly concerning. It’s likely just some mild irritation. Now, I want to do a quick hearing test just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Inflamed… so it’s not anything serious? I was getting a bit worried. I’m ready for the hearing test, whenever you are.
DOCTOR: No, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. Most of the time, these things resolve on their own. But it's always best to rule things out. Alright, we're going to go into the next room to do a quick audiometry test. Just follow my instructions in there, and we'll see what we find. It involves wearing headphones and indicating when you hear tones. It's fairly straightforward.
PATIENT: Okay, headphones and tones. Got it. Lead the way. Hopefully it doesn’t take too long, I have to get back to work eventually.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. Don't worry, you’ll be able to hear me give instructions while you're wearing them. Follow me.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks, Doctor. Let’s get this over with, then.
DOCTOR: Please put these headphones on. We’re just going to test your hearing at different frequencies. When you hear a tone, please press the button. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, headphones on, press the button when I hear something. Easy enough. Okay, all set. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll start with the right ear. ... Now the left ear. … Okay, we're almost done… just a few more frequencies to test… Alright, that’s it. Let’s take these headphones off. Hmm.
PATIENT: Okay, headphones off. So? What did you find? Is it anything bad? I’m trying not to stress, but this whole thing is a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Well, the results show mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. It's not severe, and it's consistent with noise exposure, even if you haven’t been around extremely loud noises recently. It’s likely from cumulative exposure at the restaurant. Also, there’s some evidence of tinnitus, which correlates with the ringing you’ve been experiencing.
PATIENT: Okay… high-frequency hearing loss… and tinnitus. So, what does that mean? Is there anything I can do about it? Am I going to go deaf? Sorry, I just… I don’t understand all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, you are not going to go deaf. It’s a mild loss. But it is important to protect your hearing. And tinnitus… well, it can be annoying, but it's rarely indicative of a serious problem. The plan is this: I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. If that’s not feasible at work, invest in some high-quality earplugs. I’m going to write you a prescription for some temporary, custom-fitted earplugs. Also, I'll recommend some over-the-counter remedies for the tinnitus, like melatonin, which sometimes helps with sleep disturbance associated with it. We’ll re-evaluate in three months. If it worsens, we can consider a referral to an audiologist for further testing. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… earplugs, melatonin, and come back in three months. That doesn’t sound too bad, I guess. Will the earplugs actually help? And what if the melatonin doesn’t work? I just don’t want this ringing to get worse, you know? It’s already pretty distracting. Three months feels like a long time to just… wait and see.
DOCTOR: The earplugs will help, if you wear them consistently in noisy environments. They’ll reduce the sound level reaching your ears, giving them a chance to recover. As for the melatonin… it doesn't work for everyone, admittedly. However, it’s a relatively harmless supplement, and it can improve sleep quality which, in turn, can reduce the perceived severity of the tinnitus. If the melatonin doesn't provide sufficient relief, we can discuss other options in three months – behavioral therapy is sometimes helpful for managing tinnitus. Honestly, you’re experiencing a very common condition. Many people deal with mild tinnitus. It's crucial to be proactive about protecting your hearing. I'm happy to answer your questions, but I assure you, you're not facing a medical emergency. I’ll print out a prescription for the earplugs and a handout with information about tinnitus management. Do you have any further concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess not. Just… earplugs and melatonin, protect my ears. Fine. Yes, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I really just wanted to get this checked out, you know? It’s good to know it’s not… something terrible. I’ll try the earplugs.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse send the prescription to your pharmacy. Just remember to follow my recommendations, and come back in three months for a follow-up. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing or develop any new symptoms. Have a good day, Mr. Dhanoa.
