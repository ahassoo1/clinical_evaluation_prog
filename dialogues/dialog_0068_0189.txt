DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… business. Down there. Been seeing some red in the bowl, if you catch my drift. Not a pretty sight, I tell you. And at my age, one expects certain… things, but this isn't one of 'em.
DOCTOR: I understand. Seeing blood can certainly be concerning. How long have you noticed this, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a week, maybe? Could be longer, honestly. I don’t spend that much time examining it, you understand. It’s just… been happening. Not every time, mind you. But enough to worry a fella. And I don’t get worried easily. I flew planes for forty years, you know. Saw things that would make your hair stand on end. This is… different.
DOCTOR: Forty years flying… impressive. Alright. And would you describe the blood as bright red, dark red, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright, I suppose. Not dark and… clotted, if that makes sense. More like… streaks. Like someone took a little paintbrush to it, if you don’t mind my saying. Honestly, it's just unsettling. Makes a body wonder what’s going on inside, doesn’t it? I always took care of myself, ate well… mostly. Never smoked a day in my life.
DOCTOR: Streaks of bright red blood… alright. And have you noticed any pain or discomfort with bowel movements, or any change in your usual bowel habits – like constipation, diarrhea, or feeling like you need to go more frequently?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little straining sometimes, but that’s just… getting older, I figure. Happens to the best of us. As for habits… well, they’ve been… regular enough. Not like clockwork, you understand. A man’s gotta live a little. No diarrhea or anything like that. Just… the red. That’s what’s bothering me. And frankly, it's a bit embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way, Mr. Rowbottom. It's my job to listen, and we need to discuss these things to figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My stomach's been a bit… rumblier than usual, I suppose. And I've been a bit tired lately, but who isn't at my age? I used to be able to chop wood all day, now I get winded just walking to the mailbox. Probably just getting old, I tell ya. Nothing to do with… that.
DOCTOR: Okay, rumblier stomach and some fatigue. I see. Now, have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that's a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, if that’s what you mean. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to keep track of all that. And I haven't bothered since. Might have lost a pound or two, but nothing drastic. Just… a bit looser in the belt, if you catch my drift. Not worried about my figure, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmph. Well, my mother lived to be 92, bless her soul. She was a tough old bird. As for anything… down there… not that I ever knew of. Nobody talked about such things in those days. Too improper. My father… he died young, heart attack. So, not much help there, I'm afraid. A good, strong stock, generally. I always thought so.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam, eh? Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Don't go poking around too much, though. I’m a delicate flower, you know. And I’d prefer if you didn’t have to… listen to anything. Makes a body feel… vulnerable. But go ahead. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll keep it as comfortable as possible. First, I'll listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, then I’ll just gently palpate, or press on your stomach to feel for any tenderness. Then, I'll need to do a rectal exam. This is to check for any abnormalities and to see if there's any blood present. If you could lie down on the table, please. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Rectal exam, you say? Now hold on just a minute. I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we just… skip that part? I’ve told you about the red, haven’t I? Isn't that enough? I’m not a fan of people poking around in there. Not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s not the most comfortable exam, I agree. However, given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, it’s a very important step in determining the cause. It allows me to directly assess the rectum and rule out certain conditions. We can discuss alternatives, but to be thorough, and to ensure we don't miss anything, a rectal exam is strongly recommended. We will be as gentle and quick as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmph. "Strongly recommended," is it? Always with the "strongly recommended." Fine. Explain it, then. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And be quick, I tell ya. Very quick. This is… undignified. And don't go sticking anything up there, understand? Just a quick poke and a prod is all I'm willing to tolerate. And make sure you wash your hands afterwards.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns. The exam involves gently inserting a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel for any abnormalities – like polyps, tenderness, or masses. It typically takes less than a minute. We're only looking for anything unusual. I will be as gentle as possible and we’ll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. And, of course, I'll wash my hands thoroughly before and after the exam. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Get it over with. But if it hurts, I’m stopping you right then and there. And I expect a full report afterwards. No sugarcoating. Just the facts. And be gentle, I’m telling you. Gentle. This is… a low point, a real low point.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll explain each step as I go. Please lie on your left side with your knees bent towards your chest. Take a deep breath... and relax as much as possible. I'm going to gently insert my finger about an inch or two into the rectum. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Deep breath in… and out… just relaxing… Okay, that’s all. I did not feel any masses or significant tenderness. There was a small amount of stool present, and I did see some bright red blood on my gloved finger. Your sphincter tone is normal. Now, that was relatively quick, as promised. We’ll need to discuss next steps.
PATIENT: Blood, you say? Of course there was blood. That's why I came here in the first place! And "relatively quick" is hardly a comfort, young man. So, what does it mean? Is it something serious? Am I going to… well, you know. Don't beat around the bush. Give it to me straight. And no talk of "next steps" until I know what we're dealing with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your anxiety. Seeing blood in the stool can be concerning, and it’s important to determine the cause. Bright red blood near the rectum typically indicates bleeding closer to the anus or lower colon. Common causes include hemorrhoids, anal fissures – small tears in the lining of the anus – or proctitis – inflammation of the rectum. Less common, but more serious possibilities include colorectal polyps or, rarely, colorectal cancer. Given your age and the presence of blood, we need to investigate further to rule out these more serious causes. I recommend a colonoscopy. It allows us to visualize the entire colon and rectum, identify any abnormalities, and take biopsies if needed. Would you be open to discussing that option?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy, is it? Sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. And expensive, I’ll wager. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn't we just… monitor it? Take another look in a few months? I'm not keen on having a camera shoved up my… well, you know. I’ve lived a long life, young man. Maybe it's just… old age catching up with me. Perhaps it’ll resolve on its own.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy is the most thorough way to investigate the cause of rectal bleeding and rule out serious conditions. While it’s not the most pleasant procedure, it’s generally well-tolerated, and we take steps to ensure your comfort. While monitoring the situation is an option, it does carry some risk. If the bleeding is due to a polyp or cancer, delaying diagnosis and treatment can lead to more serious complications. Given your age and history, I strongly recommend proceeding with a colonoscopy. We can discuss the procedure in detail, address any concerns you may have, and explore financial assistance options if needed. Alternatively, we could start with a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test. This test detects hidden blood in your stool. If it's positive, we would then recommend a colonoscopy. It's less invasive, but not as comprehensive. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A test, you say? A less… invasive test? Alright. That… I could live with. A stool test. It’s not ideal, but it’s better than having a camera… down there. What does it involve? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. And what if it is positive? Then I’m stuck with the camera anyway, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable approach, Mr. Rowbottom. The fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test, is a simple, non-invasive test you can do at home. It involves collecting a small stool sample – we’ll provide you with a kit and detailed instructions. You’ll send the sample to a lab for analysis. The results typically take about a week. And you are correct. If the FIT test is positive, it would indicate the presence of hidden blood, and we would recommend a colonoscopy to investigate further and determine the cause. I'll write you a prescription for the FIT test kit. If you'd like, I can also have the nurse review the instructions with you. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A kit and instructions. And a follow-up appointment. That sounds… manageable. Get the nurse to explain it thoroughly, mind you. I don't want to mess it up. And make sure it's a discreet kit. I don't want the neighbors knowing my business. Fine. Let’s get this over with. And thank you, young man. For not completely dismissing an old man’s worries.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll make sure the nurse provides you with a discreet kit and detailed instructions. It's my job to listen and address your concerns. I’m writing the prescription now. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately one week after you send in the sample. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… get the kit. And the appointment. And try not to poke around too much next time. Thank you. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll have the nurse bring the kit and schedule your appointment right away. And I assure you, we’ll proceed with caution. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day.
