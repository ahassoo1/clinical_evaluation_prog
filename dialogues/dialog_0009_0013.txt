DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I go to the bathroom. It just… stays there, sometimes. It's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder. And you said this has been going on for a “little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not a long time, but… not just yesterday, you know? Maybe a couple of weeks, I think. It’s hard to remember exactly. It's just… uncomfortable, mostly. And I have to go back more often than I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks. And it's causing discomfort and more frequent trips to the bathroom. Can you tell me a little more about the discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s not pain, exactly. More like… a fullness. A heavy feeling, down low. And sometimes, after I try to go, it feels like there's still a lot left. It’s just… not right. Like it’s not finished.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness and incomplete emptying, not sharp pain. That helps. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. It doesn't hurt when it comes out. It’s… weaker, maybe? Not as strong as it used to be. It doesn't spray like it used to, if you know what I mean. Just… a slower flow.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A weaker stream and a slower flow. Have you noticed any dribbling after you finish urinating?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not every time, but… yeah, a little. Just a few drops, after I stand up. I usually have to… dab it with a tissue. It doesn't happen every time, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent dribbling after urination. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back… no, it doesn't hurt. Sometimes my old bones ache, but that's just from being old, I think. No sharp pain, anywhere.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my wife, she passed away a few years back. That’s been hard. But other than that… not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I get my yearly checkups, but the doctor never found anything wrong, wrong. I have Medicare, so they check things pretty good, I think.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s understandable that would be difficult. And it’s good you keep up with your checkups. Besides the flu, no other major medical issues diagnosed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I've been lucky so far, I guess. Always been pretty healthy, for an old Yupik man. I mostly just fish and take care of things around the house.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And it’s good to hear you’ve stayed healthy. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. And the doctors have given me medicines before, for colds and things, and I never had a reaction. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. Just… fish oil sometimes, for my joints. But that's not a medicine, really. Just a… a healthy thing. My daughter gives it to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, just fish oil as a supplement. That's helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close family members have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He passed when I was young. And my brother… he had some trouble with his kidneys, a long time ago. But other than that… not that I remember. My mother was healthy as a horse, until she got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart disease in your father and kidney problems in your brother. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife, she didn’t like it. And I didn't want to start. Never really felt the need, either.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Just a little, sometimes. On special occasions, maybe a beer with my friends. But not often. I don’t drink much, never have. Mostly I drink water.
DOCTOR: Okay, very limited alcohol consumption. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, check your blood pressure, and then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Well… I've never had one of those before. What… what exactly does that involve, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It's a very common exam, and it helps us assess the size and condition of your prostate, which can often contribute to the symptoms you’re experiencing. I will ask you to lie on your side, and I will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel your prostate. It’s usually quick and may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’re checking for size, tenderness, and any irregularities. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Irregularities… that doesn’t sound good. Is… is there something seriously wrong, Doctor? Is that why you need to do this? I just… I don't like the sound of it.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Mr. Hilber. Irregularities can simply mean an enlarged prostate, which is common with age and often doesn't indicate anything serious. We want to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, and this exam is the best way to do that. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something seriously wrong; it's a precautionary step. We'll talk about everything we find, and explain any next steps clearly. Are you comfortable proceeding with the exam, or would you like to take a moment to think about it?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. I suppose if you say it’s just checking things, and it's not necessarily bad… Okay, Doctor. Let's get it over with. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hilber. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to lubricate this glove now, and then gently insert a finger into your rectum. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort at any point. Okay, all done. I did feel some enlargement of your prostate, which is consistent with your age. It wasn't particularly hard or irregular, but it's definitely larger than what I’d expect. Your rectum felt normal. I'll need to order a urine test to check for infection and a PSA test, which is a blood test that helps us assess the level of prostate-specific antigen. This will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A PSA test… is that the one you said checks for something bad? What if it’s… high? I don’t want any… trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Hilber. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. An elevated PSA can be an indicator of prostate problems, but it doesn't automatically mean you have cancer. Many things can cause it to be elevated, such as infection, inflammation, or simply an enlarged prostate. If the PSA level is elevated, we may need to do further testing, such as an MRI, or possibly a biopsy, to get a clearer picture. But let's not jump to conclusions. We'll start with the tests, and then we’ll discuss the results thoroughly, and I’ll explain all your options. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Tests first. That’s… that’s alright. I just… I don’t want any surprises. Can I still… fish, if all this happens? My daughter, she likes my fish.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Hilber. It's important to keep living your life while we figure things out. At this stage, there’s no reason to stop fishing. Regardless of the results, we’ll work together to manage any potential issues, and I’ll advise you on any necessary lifestyle adjustments. Fishing and enjoying time with your daughter is important. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood samples and collect a urine sample for testing. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, pain in your back or sides, or difficulty urinating, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. You… you explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I'll let the nurse come in then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. I understand this can be concerning, and I’m here to support you through the process. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready.
