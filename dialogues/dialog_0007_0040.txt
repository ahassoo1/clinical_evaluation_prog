DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Hernandez. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think they call it. It keeps coming back. And with it, these… water infections. They’re not nice at all. It's been happening for a while now, and I thought it was time to get it properly checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring flank pain and frequent water infections… that definitely warrants a look. Let’s start with the pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Right. Well… it’s a deep ache, mostly. Not sharp, usually. It's on my side, just below my ribs, on both sides actually, though sometimes one side is worse than the other. It comes and goes, like a dull throbbing. And it can get quite uncomfortable, enough to keep me awake at night sometimes. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific… eating, moving, anything like that. Just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull, throbbing ache in both flanks, sometimes worse on one side, coming and going without a clear trigger. And it’s been disrupting your sleep. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. It’s been… several years now, I think. On and off, you see. At first, it wasn’t too bad, just a little niggle now and then. But it’s definitely gotten more frequent and more bothersome in the last year or so. And that's when the water infections started happening more often too. I remember having them when I was younger, but not this often.
DOCTOR: Several years on and off, worsening over the last year, coinciding with more frequent water infections. I see. And when you say water infections, have you been officially diagnosed with UTIs each time, or are you self-diagnosing based on symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, properly diagnosed, Doctor. I always go to the doctor when I think I have one. They always do a test, you know, with a little stick. And they’ve confirmed it each time. I have the usual symptoms - burning when I go to the toilet, needing to go all the time, that sort of thing. I wouldn't bother you with it if I wasn't sure! It's just… it feels like they keep coming back, even after the antibiotics.
DOCTOR: Okay, so officially diagnosed UTIs, confirmed with a urine test each time, and they’re recurring despite antibiotic treatment. That's important information. Do you recall what antibiotics you've been prescribed for these UTIs?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it's been a few different ones, I believe. I think one was… Trimethoprim, that sounds familiar. And another one was… Nitrofurantoin, maybe? It was a little orange pill, if that helps! I’m not very good with names, Doctor. I just take what they give me, you see. I don't really pay attention to the names. I do remember taking them for about a week each time, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Trimethoprim and Nitrofurantoin, both for about a week each time. Got it. Now, aside from the flank pain and the UTIs, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I have been feeling a bit tired lately, more than usual. But I put that down to my age, to be honest. And sometimes I feel a bit… bloated, if I eat too much. Nothing major, really. Oh! And my ankles do swell up a bit at the end of the day, but that’s been happening for years too. I just wear comfy socks, you see. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, bloating, and some ankle swelling that’s been present for years. We’ll definitely keep those in mind. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well… the doctor told me a long time ago I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. Polycystic Kidney Disease, that’s it! He said I have lots of little cysts on them. He didn't say much else, to be honest. Just told me to keep an eye on things and drink plenty of water. It’s been years since I saw a specialist about it, though. I just see my regular doctor for check-ups. I suppose that’s relevant, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very relevant. Polycystic Kidney Disease… okay. I’m going to pull up your records now to get a better understanding of your history and past tests. Just while I’m doing that, could you tell me about any family history of kidney problems or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Right you are. Let me think... My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother, he had diabetes, I believe. He wasn’t very good at looking after himself, poor man. As for kidney problems... I don't recall anyone specifically having kidney trouble, no. We weren't really a family to talk about illnesses much, you see. It was more of a "grin and bear it" sort of thing. But I don't remember anyone being on dialysis or having a kidney transplant, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of hypertension, a brother with diabetes, no known family history of kidney disease beyond your diagnosis. Alright, I see here that you were diagnosed with Polycystic Kidney Disease about 15 years ago. The notes mention some cyst growth, but no recent imaging has been done. And I see a history of recurring UTIs, as you mentioned, treated with Trimethoprim and Nitrofurantoin. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of, Doctor. I've never had any trouble with medications, thankfully. I can take most things, as far as I'm aware. I don't react to anything, to be honest. My wife used to give me all sorts of things when I had a cold, and I was fine with it all. She was a good woman, my wife. But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, aside from antibiotics for these UTIs?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all, Doctor. Just the antibiotics when I need them. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, you see. I try to stay as natural as possible. I drink plenty of water, eat a bit of fruit… that sort of thing. I don't bother with all those fancy medications unless absolutely necessary. So, no, nothing else. Just the water, and the occasional antibiotic when these water infections flare up.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That gives me a good picture of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your blood pressure. Then I’d like to do a simple urine test, just to confirm you're not currently experiencing an infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to go along with whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I'm not worried, you see. Just hoping we can get to the bottom of this flank pain. It's just a bit of a nuisance, that’s all. Go ahead, please. I’ll just sit here and try not to wiggle too much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Not drastically high, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Okay. Just noting some mild tenderness on both flanks, particularly when I press deeply. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. I'm going to ask you to lie down on the examination table now so I can get a better feel.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. No problem at all. There you go. Just let me know if you need me to move or adjust in any way. I’ll try to be still. Just do what you need to do. I'm not a complicated case, you know. Just this pesky pain…
DOCTOR: Okay. There's definitely some tenderness on both flanks. I can feel some fullness, consistent with enlarged kidneys. No obvious masses. Now I'm going to percuss your abdomen to listen for any abnormalities. Sounds are normal. I'm going to auscultate your abdomen now to listen for any unusual sounds. Bowel sounds are present. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, you can sit up now. Okay. Based on the exam, your kidneys feel enlarged and there's tenderness in both flanks. Given your history of Polycystic Kidney Disease and recurring UTIs, I suspect the pain is related to the cysts on your kidneys. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urine test to check for infection and kidney function. I'm also going to order an ultrasound of your kidneys to get a better look at the cysts and rule out any blockages. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to go along with. An ultrasound sounds like a good idea. It’s good to know what’s going on in there, you see. And if it helps get to the bottom of this pain, then so much the better. I trust your judgement, Doctor. So yes, please go ahead with the tests. I just want to feel a bit better, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get the lab order for the urine test and the requisition for the ultrasound now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of the urine sample. The ultrasound will be scheduled for you at the imaging center, and we'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, to help with the pain, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also help, but be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the label. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss a more comprehensive plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Eight glasses of water, avoid caffeine and alcohol… I can manage that. I’ll stick to the pain relievers if needed. I think that’s all I need to know for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. It's reassuring to know someone is looking into it. Thank you, Doctor Hernandez. I’ll go and get that urine sample done now. .
