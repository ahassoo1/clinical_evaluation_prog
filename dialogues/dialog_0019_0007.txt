DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Lakiya. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Renzi. I am here because… well, I have been having a great deal of pain. It’s been going on for some time now, and it is not getting any better. I would like to find out what is causing it, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain… that's certainly something we want to figure out. “Some time now” is a bit vague, though – could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Roughly… let me think. It began in late October of last year, 2024. So, almost ten months now. It started small, just an ache, but it has grown steadily worse since then. It is constant now, not just coming and going.
DOCTOR: Okay, almost ten months… constant pain since late October. That helps. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It is in my lower back, Doctor. Right at the base of my spine, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it radiates down my left leg, but it is always centered in my back. It makes it difficult to… well, to do my work.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back, centered at the base of your spine, radiating down the left leg sometimes… I understand. And what kind of work do you do, Lakiya?
PATIENT: I erect fences. It is… physical work. Lots of lifting, digging, stretching wire. I have been doing it for twenty years now, but it is getting harder and harder with this pain. It used to not bother me, but… now it does. A great deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, twenty years of fence erection… that explains a lot. Heavy lifting, digging, stretching… So it sounds like this pain is impacting your ability to do your job, which is understandably concerning. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what number would you give your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Hmmm… It is difficult to say. It fluctuates. But at this very moment… I would say a seven. Sometimes it gets to an eight after I have been working, but right now, it is a seven. Constant, dull ache, with sharp pains when I move.
DOCTOR: A seven, constant dull ache with sharp pains on movement… good to know. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When I lie down, flat on my back, it eases somewhat. Also, if I apply heat to it, with a heating pad, that helps temporarily. But it always comes back when I start moving again. It’s just… relief for a short time.
DOCTOR: Lying flat, heat providing temporary relief… Okay. And have you tried any other treatments – over-the-counter medications, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes. I have tried ibuprofen, and naproxen. They do very little. They may take the edge off for a short while, but it doesn’t last, and I don’t like taking too much of them. My sister had stomach problems from taking those kinds of pills for too long. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s smart to be cautious about medication, especially given your sister’s experience. Okay, so ibuprofen and naproxen offer minimal relief. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other areas of your body, just to get a full picture. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. In my left foot, mostly. It feels… pins and needles, like it is falling asleep. It comes and goes, but it is more frequent now than it used to be. It happens mostly after I have been standing or walking for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in the left foot, more frequent after standing or walking. That's important to note. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It is difficult to explain. My left leg just feels… heavier. Like it takes more effort to lift it, or to keep it steady. I have almost fallen a couple of times because of it. It is not constant, but it worries me. It’s getting harder to balance.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling of heaviness, difficulty with balance… that is definitely something we need to investigate. Have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels – any difficulty starting or stopping, or any changes in your usual pattern?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Those functions are… normal. Completely normal. No problems there at all. I am relieved to say that has not been affected. I apologize if that is too personal a question.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Lakiya – it’s an important question to ask, just to be thorough. Good to hear that hasn’t been affected. Alright, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I had pneumonia when I was a child, and a broken arm once, but nothing serious. No diagnoses of anything chronic. I went to the tribal doctor regularly for check-ups, but he always said I was healthy. He passed away a few years ago, sadly. I have Medicare now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, just childhood pneumonia and a broken arm. Sorry to hear about your tribal doctor. Medicare is good. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I am… hesitant about having things cut open. My grandmother had a bad experience with surgery when I was young, and it frightened me. So, no surgeries. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Lakiya. No surgeries. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands and knees, mostly. It was very painful for her. My father was healthy, until he passed away from a heart attack. He was a strong man, but it happened suddenly. I don’t know of any other significant medical history in my family. I wasn't very close to many of my relatives.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart attack in your father… Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I had a glass of wine at a wedding once, but that was many years ago. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. Never have. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I know you are busy.
DOCTOR: No apologies at all, Lakiya – you’re providing me with important information. And no, you're not taking up too much of my time. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It is a little difficult, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, just going to feel along your spine here… Any sharp pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That is very tender. It feels… like a knot. And it radiates down my left leg when you press on it. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, just going to have you bend forward for me, as far as you comfortably can… and now backward… and to the right… and to the left. I'm just checking your range of motion. It appears you have limited range of motion, particularly bending forward. I also see some muscle spasm on the left side. Now, can you walk on your heels for me, and then on your toes?
PATIENT: That… is difficult. It hurts to bend forward. Walking on my heels… It is difficult to balance. And walking on my toes… I am afraid I might fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Easy now. Don’t push yourself. That’s helpful to know. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation appears intact. Alright, Lakiya, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing lower back pain, likely due to a muscle strain or possible nerve irritation. The radiating pain down your left leg, the numbness and tingling, and the difficulty with walking suggest possible sciatica. However, to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be alright. An X-ray sounds… sensible. I just want to know what is causing this pain. And to find out what I can do about it. I am worried it will get worse if I do not get it checked out. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. That’s a very sensible thing to want, and that's exactly what we're going to do. I'll write you a referral for the X-ray, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use the heat packs, and avoiding any activities that aggravate your pain. I'm also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms until we get the results of the X-ray. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… that will hopefully help me sleep. I have been having trouble sleeping because of the pain. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps exercises? Or anything I should avoid specifically?
DOCTOR: Good question. Yes, managing your sleep is important. We'll get that addressed. As for exercises, avoid any bending, lifting, or twisting for now. That could worsen the irritation. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss some gentle stretches and exercises that may help strengthen your back and core muscles. For now, focus on maintaining good posture when you are sitting or standing, and try to stay as active as you comfortably can – gentle walking is okay. And absolutely avoid any activities that significantly increase your pain. Also, I want to be cautious. If you experience any loss of bowel or bladder control, or if the pain becomes severe and sudden, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No bending, lifting, or twisting. Gentle walking is okay. Maintain good posture. And go to the emergency room if I lose control of my bowels or bladder, or if the pain gets very bad. That is a lot to remember, but I will write it down. Thank you, Doctor Renzi. I think I have everything I need. Is there a follow-up appointment scheduled?
DOCTOR: That’s very smart to write it down. It’s a lot of information. And yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, so we can discuss the X-ray results and create a more detailed treatment plan. That will be August 16th. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 16th works perfectly. Thank you again, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been very helpful. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lakiya. I’m glad I could help. And you take care now. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the referral for the X-ray, and the prescriptions. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, you as well.
