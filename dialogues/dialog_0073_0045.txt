DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s the… the flushing. My face gets very red, you see? Happens sometimes. Not always, but enough to bother me. It’s… warm too, when it happens. Like a hot flash, but all over my face.
DOCTOR: Flushing, you say. And it feels warm… like a hot flash, localized to the face. How long has this been going on, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe… six months now? Started slow, just a little color. Now it’s… more noticeable. My wife… she would notice, always. She’s… gone now. But she’d say it looked like I was embarrassed. Which is funny, because I wasn't. Usually.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it’s become more pronounced. And it happens even when you aren’t feeling flushed with emotion. Alright. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes after I eat. Not every time, mind you. And sometimes… just happens. I might be sitting, watching TV, and… boom. Red face. No particular thing. It doesn’t hurt, just… uncomfortable. People look.
DOCTOR: So, it seems somewhat unpredictable, sometimes after eating, sometimes spontaneously. And it’s not accompanied by any pain, just the… discomfort and attention it draws. Do you notice anything specific about what you eat when it happens?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Not that I can tell. I like curry, sometimes. Spicy food. But I eat curry all the time. Doesn’t always happen after that. I had noodles last week, and it happened then. Plain noodles. So, no, Doctor. I really don’t think there’s anything special about the food.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. Maybe a little tired, sometimes. But I’m old, Doctor. Everyone gets tired. No headaches, no dizziness. No… nothing else that I can think of. Just the red face. It’s mostly bothersome, you see? Makes me self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not much, really. Doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. Gave me a pill for it. I stopped taking it after a while. Seemed okay. And I had a bad knee, got it fixed. Apart from that… nothing much. I keep pretty good health, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, that’s all. But that’s just because it’s dark a lot. Nothing for the flushing, nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife… she had some allergies, but I didn't. I can eat anything, take anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Please relax. Deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a closer look at your face. I notice some mild erythema… particularly across the cheeks and nose. No rash or visible lesions. Capillary refill appears normal.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear about the heart and lungs. My father had a bad heart, so I always worry about that. The redness… that’s what I’m talking about. It comes and goes, you see? Sometimes it’s more, sometimes less. Like now, it’s not too bad. But it can be quite red.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m palpating your thyroid gland now. It feels… slightly enlarged, but without any distinct nodules. I’m going to ask some further questions. Do you have any history of thyroid problems in your family?
PATIENT: Thyroid… hmm. My mother, I think… she had something with her thyroid. But I don’t remember exactly what. She was sick a lot, towards the end. Something about feeling tired all the time. And swelling in her neck. I was young, you see? I didn’t pay much attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any difficulty swallowing, any changes in your voice, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I eat everything just fine. My voice is the same as always, I think. And my weight… well, I’ve always been this size. Maybe a little heavier in the winter, but nothing dramatic. I like my food too much to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the slightly enlarged thyroid, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check your thyroid function, complete blood count, and rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it’s needed. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s causing this redness, you see? It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m ordering a complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone , free T4, and a basic metabolic panel. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. The lab results typically take a few days. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding spicy foods and excessive alcohol consumption. We’ll see if that has any effect on your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. No spicy food, no alcohol… I can manage that. Eight hours fasting… that’s not too bad. I’ll make an appointment for the blood work right away. Thank you for taking the time to listen, and for running the tests. Hopefully, we’ll find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will provide you with the lab requisition and instructions. We’ll see you in a week to discuss the results. If your symptoms worsen significantly—such as difficulty breathing or severe chest pain—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again. I appreciate your help. I’ll go find the nurse now.
