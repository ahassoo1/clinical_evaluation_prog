DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's…well, it's this tiredness. Just dreadful, really. I feel like I could sleep for a week and still be worn out. It comes and goes, but when it comes… honestly, it's like someone drained all the life out of me. My husband says it's just old age, but… I used to be strong. I was a commercial diver, you know. Not many women did that back then.
DOCTOR: A commercial diver?
PATIENT: Yes, a diver! For years. Underwater welding, inspections… all sorts of things. It was… demanding work. More demanding than this, certainly. Though what good is strength now, eh? It certainly isn't helping with this… weakness. I don't understand why I'm suddenly so frail.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And this tiredness… how long has this been going on for, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It feels like… months now? Maybe longer? Everything’s a bit blurry these days. It started gradually, I think. Just feeling a little more tired than usual. Then it got worse, and worse, and… well, here I am. I don't keep track of dates so well, you see. My husband handles all that.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. And is it constant, or does it come and go as you mentioned?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. There are days when I can potter about the house, do a bit of gardening… nothing strenuous, mind you. But then… out of nowhere, it hits. Like a wave. I just have to lie down. And the aches! Oh, the aches. My muscles feel… heavy. Like they’re full of lead. It’s very unpleasant. My husband says I just need more rest, but I am resting!
DOCTOR: I see. And apart from the tiredness and aches, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit clumsy lately, dropping things. Not a lot, but more than usual. And my appetite… it comes and goes too, like everything else. Some days I could eat a horse, other days I barely manage a few bites. Nothing serious, I wouldn’t think. Just old age again, probably. I don't want to make a fuss, you see.
DOCTOR: And are you having any difficulty with your memory, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes, a little. Not terribly, mind you. Just… forgetting names sometimes. Or where I put things. It’s frustrating, really. My husband has to remind me of things constantly. He says it’s just a normal part of getting older, but I used to have a very good memory. I was always very organized. It's… unsettling. It’s not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… good heavens. Now you’re asking personal questions! I… I don't really discuss such things with doctors. It’s… private. Is it really necessary to know about that? I mean, I go to the bathroom, of course! Everyone does! Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It's important to have a complete picture of your health, Ms. Oitker. Have you noticed any changes – constipation, diarrhea, anything unusual?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. I suppose… things haven't been quite regular lately. A bit… slow, if you must know. And sometimes a bit… uncomfortable. But I just assumed it was the food. I haven’t been eating properly, you see, with this tiredness. It’s all rather upsetting, really. I came here because I’m tired, not to discuss… that. Is it connected to the tiredness, do you think?
DOCTOR: We need to rule out all possibilities, Ms. Oitker. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, yes, probably. My clothes aren't fitting as well. But that's just because I haven't been feeling up to cooking proper meals! I used to make lovely curries, you know. My husband says I'm being fussy, but it’s hard to enjoy a good meal when you’re feeling so weak. It’s all connected, isn’t it? The tiredness, the aches, the… everything! I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it years ago. And sometimes a pain reliever for my arthritis, when it flares up. But that’s all, I think. Just the usual things for an old woman. My husband keeps track of all that. He's very organized. I can't remember the names of the pills, I’m afraid. They’re little white ones, and some blue ones... Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Ms. Oitker, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes. If you could just sit up here for me.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Must we? It’s all rather… invasive, isn’t it? I don’t like doctors poking and prodding. But… alright. If you insist. Just be gentle, please. I’m a delicate flower, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds… regular, but a slight murmur. Not new, I presume?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh, dear. The doctor mentioned something years ago, when I first started taking the blood pressure pills. Said it wasn’t anything to worry about. Just an old woman’s heart, he said. But is it connected to this tiredness, do you think? Everything feels connected lately, and it’s very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, thankfully. Now, can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that strong enough? I haven’t been doing much gardening lately, you see. My husband says I need to rest more, but it’s hard to rest when you’re feeling so… depleted. It doesn’t feel very strong, does it?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little diminished. Now, I’m going to need to check your thyroid. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged. I’m also noting some mild muscle weakness in your legs. Overall, Ms. Oitker, your exam findings suggest some potential issues that need further investigation.
PATIENT: Issues? What sort of issues? Enlarged thyroid? Muscle weakness? That sounds… dreadful. Is it serious? Am I… ill? My husband will be so worried.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Ms. Oitker. However, these findings warrant some blood work. We need to check your thyroid function, complete blood count, Vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I'm also going to order a TSH test, and potentially a thyroid ultrasound.
PATIENT: Blood work… and an ultrasound? Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. What will the blood work tell you? Will it be painful? And what if the ultrasound shows something… bad? Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting quite frightened. My husband is very protective, you know. He won’t be pleased about all this. Is there anything… anything simple we can do, instead?
DOCTOR: The blood work is a simple blood draw, Ms. Oitker. It’s not painful. As for the ultrasound, it’s non-invasive. We use sound waves to create an image of your thyroid. It won’t hurt. But these tests are necessary to rule out potential causes for your symptoms. Honestly, Ms. Oitker, avoiding tests won't make the tiredness go away. It's time we get to the bottom of this, and the first step is getting some information. I will have the nurse draw the blood today and we'll schedule the ultrasound for early next week. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, and try to maintain a healthy diet as best you can. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: I suppose not. Rest… and a healthy diet. Easier said than done, when you feel so… drained. Very well, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. But please… try to be gentle. And don’t tell my husband everything at once. He worries so. Just… the basics, alright? Can the nurse explain the blood work to me? I get confused so easily.
DOCTOR: I’ll make a note to have the nurse explain the procedure thoroughly, Ms. Oitker. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and discuss the next steps. If anything concerning appears, I'll have the nurse contact you immediately. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or significant weakness – please go to the emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… chest pain… Oh, dear. I… I think so. Yes, Doctor. I understand. Thank you… I think. I suppose I should go now? Is there anything else?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Oitker. That will be all for today. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day.
