DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It’s my throat. It… hurts. Been hurting. I need to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible. “Been hurting” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Look, it just does. It’s… scratchy. And sore. Like something’s stuck. I don’t know what you want me to say? I don’t go around thinking about how my throat feels all day. It’s a throat. It hurts when I swallow. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. It is good enough. When did this start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. A few days, maybe? A week? It all feels the same. Time… blurs. I work long hours. It's not important. It just started hurting, alright? I don't keep a calendar of my ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a week or so. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Look, I work with machines all day. It's hot in there. And my body aches because I work. I don't sit around taking my temperature. Is this a trick question? Are you trying to make me look foolish? I just want something for my throat.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I apologize if I'm asking silly questions. I just need to gather some information so I can understand what might be going on and figure out the best way to help you. When you say it's hot where you work, do you feel generally warm to the touch, or are you just saying it's a warm environment?
PATIENT: Warm environment! It's a factory! It’s hot. What part of that is unclear? And what does that even matter? My throat hurts. Machines are loud. It’s dusty. I’m tired. I don't have time for a geography lesson about my workplace. Look, can we just skip to the part where you give me something to make it stop?
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. I understand your frustration. Before I recommend anything, I do need to ask a few more questions, just to be safe. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No! If I couldn’t breathe, do you think I’d be standing here? Honestly! And my voice… probably sounds awful. Everything sounds awful when your throat feels like sandpaper. It’s… raspy, I guess. Look, I’m not a singer. I operate machines. It's not like I need a perfect voice for my job! Can we please just be done with this? I've wasted enough time already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Just a few more moments, and then we’ll take a look. I'm going to listen to your breathing and check your throat. Could you open your mouth for me, and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Can we be done now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your lungs sound clear, and I do notice some redness in your throat and a few slightly swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven't taken anything in years. I just… tough it out. I don’t have insurance, remember? I can’t go running to the doctor every time I sneeze. So, no. No allergies. But if you give me something that makes me feel worse, then I’ll know I’m allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have pharyngitis – a sore throat, probably caused by a viral infection. Most cases resolve on their own within a week with supportive care. I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help with the discomfort. Lozenges and warm salt water gargles can also be soothing. It's important to drink plenty of fluids. However, if your symptoms worsen—if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing—you should seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So... you're telling me to take some pills and drink water? That's it? I could have figured that out myself. I wasted an hour of my life for this? And I have to come back if it gets worse? You really expect me to come back here? Forget it. I'll just… deal with it. Thank you for… nothing. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. I’ve documented our conversation, and the sheet has information about when to seek further medical attention. I wish you a speedy recovery. If you do decide to seek further care, there are free clinics in the area I can provide information for. .
