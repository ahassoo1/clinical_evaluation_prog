DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… this swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s my leg, mostly. It’s… puffy. I don’t know why it’s doing that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. “After the cancer” – can you tell me a little more about the cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it was in my breast. A few years ago now. They did… things. Surgery, and then the… the waves. Radiation, I think they called it. It was a long time ago, honestly. I don't remember all the details. It’s just… this leg is bothering me now. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Sasha. Knowing you had breast cancer and received surgery and radiation is very helpful. And it’s good you’re bringing this leg swelling to my attention now. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer in 2020 and completed treatment in 2021. That helps me understand the timeline. Now, about this swelling… When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, 2020… yes, that sounds right. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. The swelling… hmm. Maybe a month ago? It started small, I think. I thought it was just from walking too much, you know? But it hasn’t gone down. It feels… heavy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sasha. Heavy is a good way to describe it. And that it hasn't gone down after a month is why you're right to get it checked out. Is the swelling in just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one. My right leg is fine, thank you. It’s only this left one that feels… off. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… there. And puffy. Sometimes it feels a little warm too, but I don’t know if that’s just me. I get warm easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's just the left leg that’s swollen, and it’s been present for about a month. You've noticed it feels heavy and sometimes warm. No pain, though. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at and feel both of your legs to compare them. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my leg. It’s… worrying me a little. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, I’m noting some difference in circumference between your left and right legs. Your left leg is approximately 2 centimeters larger at both the calf and above the knee. The skin on your left leg is slightly warmer to the touch as you mentioned, and I don’t feel any major tenderness. I’m also checking the pulses in your feet... Both pulses are present and feel equal in strength. I'm also noting some mild pitting edema when I press on your left lower leg for a short time. Based on what I'm hearing and feeling, it sounds like you likely have some lymphedema in your left leg. This is a common side effect after cancer treatment, particularly after lymph nodes are removed or radiation is given, as it can affect the drainage of fluid in that limb. However, we need to rule out other causes, such as a blood clot. I want to order a Duplex Ultrasound of your left leg to evaluate the blood flow and see if there's any blockage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lymp-eh-what? Oh dear. Is that… bad? I knew I shouldn’t have let it go this long. A blood clot… that does sound bad. So, an ultrasound? To look at the blood? Yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. It's just… worrying. I don't want it to get worse. Will the ultrasound hurt?
DOCTOR: Lymphedema, Sasha, is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid in the tissues when the lymphatic system isn't working efficiently. It's not necessarily “bad” in the sense of being immediately dangerous, but it can cause discomfort and, if left untreated, can lead to skin infections or other complications. It's good you're getting it checked out now. The ultrasound is completely painless. A technician will use a gel on your leg and move a handheld device over the skin. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels, so we can see if there are any clots or blockages. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. I'm also going to order some blood work to get a baseline and rule out any other potential causes. Would you like me to explain the blood work tests I’m ordering?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… much better than needles! Okay, good. No needles. Blood work is… blood work, I suppose. But yes, if you could tell me what they’re looking for, that would be nice. I always worry about what all those numbers mean. I don’t understand any of it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sasha. We'll be checking a Complete Blood Count, or CBC, to look at your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can give us information about your overall health and rule out any infection. We'll also be checking your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel, as kidney problems can sometimes cause swelling. And finally, we'll be checking your D-dimer level, which is a test that can help rule out a blood clot. If the D-dimer is elevated, it doesn't definitely mean you have a clot, but it would prompt us to investigate further. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things! Red blood cells… I think I remember something about those. Kidneys… those do something with water, right? And… dimmers? Like for lights? It’s a bit much, to be honest. But… okay. You're checking to make sure everything is working okay. And the dimmers… are important if there’s a clot? I just want to know… is it serious? Should I be really worried?
DOCTOR: You're remembering correctly about the kidneys and water, Sasha. And yes, the D-dimer is a bit of a technical term. Think of it as a marker that can suggest the possibility of a clot. I understand your concern, and it's good you're asking these questions. Right now, we don't know if it’s serious. That’s what these tests are for – to get more information and determine the cause of the swelling. Lymphedema itself isn’t usually an emergency, but it's important to rule out a blood clot, as that would be more serious. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, I don’t believe you’re in immediate danger. But we need to get these tests done to be sure. I’m going to write you a lab order and a referral for the ultrasound. The lab is just down the hall, and the imaging center is located at [address]. Do you have any trouble getting transportation to either of these locations?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good to hear. Not immediate danger. That’s a relief. I can get a ride from my neighbor, Madame Dubois. She’s very kind. She drives me to the market sometimes. So… I go to the lab, they take some blood, then I go to the imaging place and they… look at my leg with a machine? And then what happens? Will you call me with the results? I don't want to keep waiting and worrying.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful about Madame Dubois, Sasha. That's very kind of her. Yes, that’s exactly right. You’ll go to the lab, they’ll take a small sample of blood, and then you’ll go to the imaging center for the ultrasound. The technician will apply some gel to your leg and move a handheld device over the skin to create the images. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. And yes, I will absolutely call you with the results as soon as they are available. The lab results usually come back within a day or two, and the ultrasound report typically takes a bit longer – maybe 24-48 hours. My nurse, Emily, will also be able to help you schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. In the meantime, try to elevate your left leg as much as possible when you’re resting and avoid prolonged standing. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Elevate it… yes, I can do that. My chair is quite comfortable. Oh… um… no, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And… reassuring. It’s just… I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I understand, and it's perfectly okay to worry. That's what I'm here for. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your follow-up. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and please give Madame Dubois my regards.
