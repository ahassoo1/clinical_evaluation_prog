DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I don’t usually go to doctors, honestly. Waste of time, most of it. But the army… they want this exam thing before I can even think about signing up. Said I gotta get checked out. So here I am. It's August 2nd, right? Just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Right, August 2nd it is. And I understand, a lot of folks feel that way about doctor visits. But it's good you're getting it done, especially with the army on your mind. We just want to make sure you're in good shape. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about why the army requires this exam?
PATIENT: Honestly? No idea. They just… sent a paper. Said "pre-enlistment physical." Something about making sure I can handle it. I’m in pretty good shape, if you gotta know. Worked with engines my whole life. It's not like I'm sitting around all day. But they want the exam. I don't make the rules. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-enlistment physical. That makes sense. And I appreciate you letting me know you're active, that's good to hear. We’ll try to make this as efficient as possible. To get started, could you tell me a bit about any current medical issues you're dealing with?
PATIENT: Medical issues? Look, I ain't got time for complaining. I’ve got a bad back sometimes, from lifting stuff at work. Happens. Rub some cream on it, it's fine. And my knees creak a bit in the cold. Old age, I guess. That's it. Nothing serious. I don't need a whole song and dance about it. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, a bad back and some creaky knees. I appreciate you being upfront about that. Even those things are important to document. Just to be thorough, when did the back pain start, and how often does it bother you?
PATIENT: Thorough? Look, it started… I dunno, a few years back. Lifting a particularly heavy engine block. Happens every now and then. When I lift something really heavy, or if it's cold and damp. Maybe once a month? Sometimes not for a couple months. I just… deal with it. It's not stopping me from doing anything. Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my aches and pains. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delron. We just need a clear picture of what's going on. It helps us make sure you're fit for service, and to rule out anything that might become a problem later on. Okay, so back pain, occasional, related to heavy lifting. Now, let's talk about those knees. When did you first notice them creaking, and does it affect your ability to walk or do other activities?
PATIENT: Look, it's been a while, alright? Probably a few years, same as the back. It's just… old age. They creak when it’s cold, or if I’ve been standing for a long time. It doesn't stop me from doing anything, but it's… noticeable. I walk fine. I can climb ladders. I can do everything I need to do. Are we getting somewhere with this, or are we just talking about my knees all day? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both the back and knees are long-standing issues, occasional discomfort, not limiting your activities. That's good to know. Now, thinking broader than just the back and knees, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Past problems? Hmm. Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. Healed fine. Had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, all that. Nothing serious. No surgeries, no major illnesses. I don't smoke, don't drink much. Oh, and I had a really bad case of the flu a couple years ago, but everyone gets the flu, right? That's it. Really, I'm a pretty healthy guy.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, typical childhood illnesses, a bad flu a couple years ago, and otherwise healthy. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nope. Not allergic to anything. I eat everything. Take whatever pills I need to when I’m sick, no problems. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I think people make a big deal out of allergies. My wife's always complaining about something, but I'm fine. Can we please get this over with? I got a truck to fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And you mentioned your wife - do you live with her?
PATIENT: Yeah, I live with my wife, Ingrid. Been married a long time. She worries too much, always has. She's a good woman, but… she'll tell you all my aches and pains if you ask her. Probably exaggerate them too. But yeah, we live together. Normal life. She does most of the cooking, I do most of the fixing. Is this about my wife now? I thought we were here for the army exam.
DOCTOR: No, no, just gathering information. It helps to get a full picture. Okay, so you live with your wife, Ingrid. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Serious conditions… Hmm. My father had heart trouble when he got older, had to watch his diet. My mother had arthritis, bad hands. My sister's got high blood pressure, but she smokes, so… That's about it, I think. Nothing major. They all lived long lives, mostly. Look, I'm telling you all this, but I don't see what it has to do with me. I feel fine. I am fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, arthritis, and high blood pressure. That’s good to know. It can give us some clues. Alright, before we move on to a physical exam, just one last question. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nope. Not taking anything. Just a bit of cream for my back sometimes, when it's really bothering me. That's it. No pills, no supplements, no nothing. I don't like taking pills. I told you, I'm a pretty healthy guy. So, can we finally get to the physical now? I got things to do, you know. This is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, just cream for your back occasionally. Okay, that’s good to know. Okay, Delron, let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your back and knees. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The quicker the better. Don't poke around too much, alright? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the stress of the exam, or just your normal activity level. I'm listening to your lungs now… They sound clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. And now, your back. There's some tenderness when I press here… Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that’s it. That's where it hurts. Especially when I lift something heavy. See? Told you. It's my back. It's always been my back. What's that mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It seems like you have some muscle tension and tenderness in your lower back. It doesn't appear to be anything structural, like a fracture, but it's definitely causing you some discomfort. Okay, and now let's check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: There we go. Creak, creak. Hear that? They always do that. Especially in the morning, or when it's cold. It's just old age, I tell ya. Nothing serious. Can we be done now? This is starting to hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling your knees now. There's some mild crepitus, which is the clicking or popping sound you mentioned, and some slight tenderness on the inside of both knees. There’s no significant swelling or instability. Alright, Delron, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it seems like you have some muscle tension in your lower back and some mild crepitus and tenderness in both knees. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to stress or anxiety.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Can I still join the army? That’s all I care about. Is it gonna stop me?
DOCTOR: Okay, Delron. Here's what we've got. The muscle tension in your back is likely due to your work lifting engines. It doesn't seem to be a serious injury, but it's something we need to manage. The crepitus in your knees is common with age and activity, but we want to make sure it doesn't worsen. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. Now, regarding your ability to join the army… It's difficult for me to say definitively. The army has specific medical standards, and they’ll make the final determination. I would recommend you disclose everything we’ve discussed today to the army medical personnel. They may require further testing, such as X-rays of your back and knees, and a blood pressure check. I can write a summary of my findings for you to take with you. However, be aware that the army may require a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: X-rays? More testing? This is getting complicated. I just wanted a quick check-up. So, you're saying I might be able to join, but they might not let me? What if they say no? Can you… can you write something that makes me look good? Just… emphasize that I’m strong and healthy, despite a little back pain? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Delron, I understand your frustration, and I wish I could give you a definitive answer. However, I have a professional and ethical obligation to provide an honest and accurate medical assessment. I cannot alter my findings to make you appear healthier than you are. That would be unethical and could potentially jeopardize your health and safety, as well as the safety of others. I can write a summary of my findings, including the fact that you are generally in good health, but I will also include the details about your muscle tension in your back and the mild crepitus in your knees, as well as your slightly elevated blood pressure. It’s important to be transparent with the army medical personnel. If they require further testing, I recommend you comply with their requests. They’re doing their due diligence to ensure you’re fit for service. Ultimately, the decision rests with them. I can’t guarantee they’ll let you join, but being honest and proactive will give you the best chance. Would you like me to write that summary for you now?
PATIENT: Fine. Write the summary. Everything. The back pain, the creaky knees, the… whatever. Just… get it over with. I guess I'll just have to hope for the best. And… thanks. I guess. For not just… lying. How long will it take? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: It will just take a few minutes to finalize. I'll include my contact information should the army medical personnel have any questions. Here you go. This is a detailed summary of your examination, including all of the findings we discussed. Remember, being honest and proactive with the army medical personnel is the best course of action. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s… that’s everything. Thanks again. I guess I’ll just wait and see what they say. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. I wish you the best of luck. And remember, taking care of your health is important, regardless of the outcome. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care.
