DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin', Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. My blood pressure's been up, that's what. My regular doctor said I oughta get it checked out by someone else for a bit, so here I am. Don't like sittin' around too long, if you don't mind gettin' right to it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I understand wanting to be efficient. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. Just to get a better understanding, how long has your blood pressure been elevated, and do you know what readings your regular doctor was concerned about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been… a few months now, I reckon. Not sure on the numbers, exactly. He just said it was too high when I went for my yearly checkup. He wrote somethin' down, but I left the paper at home. Old age, you know. Things slip my mind. I mostly just remember him lookin' worried. It ain't bothered me much, though – just feel a little tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. A little tiredness can be a symptom, yes. Okay, let’s get a current reading and then we can talk about some other questions. I’ll need to check your blood pressure and pulse first. And then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Get it over with, the sooner the better. I got a batch of blueberry muffins needin’ bakin’ this afternoon. Folks expect 'em fresh.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is reading 162 over 94. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but you do have a slightly diminished breath sound on the lower right side. Do you have any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: 162… that is high, huh? Never been that high before. No shortness of breath, no. And no chest pain. Just… tired. Like I said. That little cough I had last winter, maybe that's somethin'? It lingered a bit longer than usual, even after the worst of it was gone. Didn't bother me enough to see a doctor about it then, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. A lingering cough could be related. To get a clearer picture, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No fever, no chills, definitely no night sweats. I sleep like a log, usually. Though sometimes I wake up feelin' a little achy, but I figure that's just old bones. Been bakin' since I was a little girl, you know. Lots of standin' and movin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight... hmm. I think I might've lost a couple pounds, maybe. Not on purpose. Just haven't been feelin' as hungry lately, I guess. Everything tastes alright, though. Still enjoy my meals. Just don't eat as much of 'em. Blueberry muffins are my favorite, you know. Can't resist a good muffin.
DOCTOR: Okay. And could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands, helps with the achin'. Can't remember the name of it right offhand, the bottle's got a blue label. Allergies… not really. Never had any trouble with food or nothin'. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen's bad in the spring, but that's all. I mostly just take that arthritis medicine and a multivitamin, keepin' things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you mind if I take a quick look at your hands?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. They ain't pretty, after all these years of bakin', but they get the job done. Just a little stiff sometimes, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some swelling and stiffness in your finger joints, which is consistent with arthritis. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… Let me think. My mama, she had high blood pressure toward the end of her life. Had to be careful with salt, I remember that much. And my grandpa, on my daddy's side, he had a touch of the sugar, they called it. Diabetes, I think. Other than that, nothin' I can recall. Mostly just strong folks who lived long lives, workin' the land. Cherokee folks, you know, resilient bunch.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And finally, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What's that mean, exactly? I've lived in this town my whole life. Been a baker since I was a girl. Widowed about ten years ago now. Just me and my muffins mostly, these days. Don't do much travelin', and don't have much call for fancy parties. I mostly just keep busy bakin' and lookin' after things. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Venna. That gives me a good picture. Okay, so we've got elevated blood pressure, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, a touch of diabetes in your grandfather, and some arthritis in your hands. Considering everything, I think we need to investigate this blood pressure further. I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. We should also do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. If it'll help figure things out, go ahead. I just wanna be able to keep bakin' my muffins, you know? Folks depend on me. When's all this happen? Can I still bake while we're figurin' it out? I got an order for a weddin' next month.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. You can certainly continue bakin' as we investigate. We'll schedule the blood work and EKG as soon as possible – I'll have my nurse set that up for you before you leave. We'll review the results together once they come back. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a log of your blood pressure readings at home if you have a monitor. And try to limit your salt intake and eat a healthy diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that's all for now, Doctor. You've been a big help explainin' things. Just… try not to keep me waitin' too long for those results, alright? Folks are already askin' about the weddin' cake. And tell your nurse to write down clear as she can, this old lady's eyesight ain't what it used to be. Thank you kindly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I'll make sure the nurse sets everything up clearly and we’ll get those results to you as quickly as possible. We'll do our best to keep things moving. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and enjoy your bakin'.
