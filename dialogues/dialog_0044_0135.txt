DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… something coming from my ear. A little liquid, you see. It is… bothersome. I noticed it maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little liquid coming from your ear for the past three days. I understand. That is bothersome. Can you describe the liquid for me?
PATIENT: It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellowish. Not a lot, Doctor. Just a few drops when I… when I move my head. It does not smell, if that is important. And it makes my ear feel… full, like water inside.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Clear to yellowish, a few drops with movement, no odor, and a feeling of fullness. Does it happen with any particular movements, or is it random?
PATIENT: Mostly when I lie down on that side, Doctor. The left side. And… when I clean my ear. But not every time, you understand. Sometimes I clean, nothing comes out. Sometimes… a little. It is confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand it's confusing when it's not consistent. So it's primarily when you lie on your left side and occasionally with cleaning. Have you noticed any pain with this, or any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. But… my hearing. Yes. It is… quieter. Not much different, but… if someone speaks softly, I must ask them to repeat. Before, I did not have this trouble. It is in the same ear as the liquid, the left one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed some mild hearing loss in the left ear along with the liquid discharge. Have you had any fever, any dizziness, or any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. No dizziness either. And… ringing? No, I do not think so. Sometimes it is quiet in my room, yes, but that is normal. I do not hear a ring. Just… silence. Is that okay? Is that… a bad thing?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Radillo, it's good you're clarifying. It's not a bad thing that your room is quiet! I was just checking to see if you experience a constant ringing sound – we call that tinnitus. Now, have you ever had any ear infections before, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was a young boy, maybe ten years old, I had a very bad ear ache. My mother… she gave me some drops. It hurt a lot. And… once, when I was in university, I had much wax in my ears. The doctor had to… remove it. But no other troubles. Not until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood ear infection and wax removal. That's good information. Do you recall if the childhood ear infection was in the same ear as the current problem – your left ear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I remember it was the left ear. My mother said it was a very bad infection. She took me to the clinic… a different clinic, of course. In Mogadishu. She was very worried. It was… a long time ago. Do you need to know more about this?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright for now, Mr. Radillo. Just helpful to know. Now, thinking about other things – do you work in a noisy environment, or frequently use headphones or earplugs?
PATIENT: I am a teacher, Doctor. At the college. I teach history. It is not… very noisy. Sometimes students talk, of course. And I use… a microphone, when I speak to the large class. But no headphones, no earplugs. I prefer to hear the students directly. It is better for understanding.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Alright, let’s do a quick examination of your ears. I’m going to use an otoscope to take a look inside. It won’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try to stay very still. I do not like things in my ears, but I trust you. Please… be gentle. And tell me if you see something… bad? Is that alright to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Radillo, you can always ask questions. I'll be as gentle as possible. Hmm… okay. I do see some fluid in the ear canal, as you described. The eardrum itself looks a little… cloudy, and it doesn't move quite as much as it should when I puff air into it. It doesn't appear to be perforated, which is good. I'll take a look at your right ear as well, just for comparison. Your right ear looks normal – clear ear canal, eardrum is healthy and moves well. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it sounds like you likely have an inflammation of the middle ear, potentially with some fluid buildup – we call that otitis media. It's likely causing the discharge, the feeling of fullness, and the mild hearing loss. The cloudiness of the eardrum suggests a possible infection.
PATIENT: Otitis… media? Is that serious, Doctor? Will I… become deaf? My father, he had trouble hearing in his old age. I do not want that. And what must I do to get better? Do I need… surgery? Will it be painful? I am… a little worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Radillo. Otitis media itself is usually not serious, and it rarely leads to permanent hearing loss. It's a common condition, especially if you've had any recent cold or allergy symptoms. However, we want to treat it to prevent complications and get your hearing back to normal. Your father's hearing loss was likely due to age-related changes, and this is different. Surgery is very rarely needed for otitis media. In most cases, it can be treated with medication. I'm going to prescribe you an oral antibiotic to fight any potential infection. I'm also going to recommend a decongestant to help clear any blockage in your ear and reduce the fluid buildup. I'll also advise you to avoid getting water in your ear for a few days. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I do not take any medicines regularly. Just sometimes, when I have a headache, I use… paracetamol. I can take paracetamol with the antibiotic, yes? And… how long must I take the medicines? And should I… see another doctor if it does not get better? I have a friend who has a very good doctor in Nairobi, perhaps…
DOCTOR: Yes, you can absolutely take paracetamol if you have a headache while on the antibiotic. There are no known interactions. You’ll need to take the antibiotic for 7 days, even if you start feeling better before then – it’s important to finish the course to make sure the infection is completely cleared. The decongestant is usually taken for 3-5 days, or until your symptoms improve. And yes, absolutely. If your symptoms don't improve within 5-7 days, or if they get worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me. If I am unavailable, seeing your friend's doctor in Nairobi is a perfectly reasonable option. It's always good to have a trusted medical professional you can rely on. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I was very worried, but I feel much better now. I will take the medicines as you said, and I will… avoid getting water in my ear. Thank you again, Doctor Asami.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could ease your worries. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions that come up. I’ll have the nurse print out the prescription and some aftercare instructions for you. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
