DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s been a bit of a rough patch, I suppose. I’ve been feeling sick to my stomach a lot lately. And I just don’t seem to have much appetite anymore. I get full after just a little bit of food, and it’s…well, it’s worrying me. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling sick to your stomach and a loss of appetite – that definitely sounds concerning. And you said it’s been going on for a little while… can you try to remember roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear, dates… they just slip my mind these days. Hmm… let me think. It feels like… maybe since springtime? Or was it earlier? I’ve been spending a lot of time with the animals, training the young ones… that keeps me busy, you see. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, I really wish I could be more helpful. It just… gradually got worse, I think. Not all at once.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. It's very common to have trouble pinpointing exact dates. “Gradually getting worse” is helpful information. So, springtime or a little before… okay. And can you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a sharp pain, not like when I had that bad gallbladder trouble years ago. It’s more like… a queasy feeling. Just unsettled. Sometimes it comes in waves, and other times it's just a constant little… flutter in my stomach. It doesn't always end in actually being sick, if you know what I mean. Just… uncomfortable. And it seems to happen almost any time of day, not just after eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasy, fluttering, not always leading to vomiting, and happening throughout the day. That gives me a better idea. Now, when you do eat, what sorts of foods are you able to keep down, and which ones tend to bother you more?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It’s gotten to where… not much, really. Plain crackers sometimes, and broth. Soup is okay if it’s not too rich. But anything with a lot of fat… oh, goodness, no. And meat… even the smell of it sometimes makes me feel a little sick. It's just… not appealing anymore. I used to love a good roast chicken, but now… I don’t even want to think about it. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're tolerating plain foods like crackers and broth, but fatty foods and meat are difficult. And the smell of meat is even bothersome. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, Raymonde?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been awfully tired lately. More tired than usual, even for an old woman like me! And… oh, yes. My stomach feels… full, really quickly. Like I only need a few bites and I’m stuffed. It’s uncomfortable, and it seems to stay that way for a long time. I don't know if that's related, but it feels like it might be. I haven't been having any trouble with… well, you know… going to the bathroom. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and early fullness are also present. And you’re not experiencing any changes in your bowel habits, that’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I haven't weighed myself regularly, I’m ashamed to say. I used to, but… well, things slip your mind as you get older. I feel like my clothes are a little looser, maybe? But I haven’t actually stepped on the scale to check. I just… haven’t felt up to it, to be honest. It's another one of those things. It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, that’s alright. It sounds like you've been dealing with quite a bit. Before we move on to your medical history, let me just quickly ask about any pain – anywhere in your body – besides the stomach discomfort we've discussed.
PATIENT: Well, my joints ache sometimes, like they always do when the weather changes. But that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing new there. And… oh, I had a little twinge in my back a few days ago, when I was bending over to help one of the baby goats. But it didn’t last long, and it didn’t bother me much. Just a little stiffness. No, nothing really painful, just the usual aches and creaks. And the stomach queasiness, of course. That's the worst of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the usual aches and creaks, and the stomach discomfort. Thank you. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I used to be a little sensitive to penicillin when I was younger, but that was ages ago. They don’t give me that anymore, thankfully. And I haven't been eating anything unusual, just the usual… well, what little I can eat these days. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it's called. And I take a calcium supplement, for my bones. That's it, really. Just the two. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a little over-the-counter sleep aid, but not very often. It doesn't always work, to be honest. But that's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, calcium supplement, and occasional over-the-counter sleep aid. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past, like diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Well, the doctor told me a while back that my blood pressure was a little high, which is why I’m taking the Lisinopril. And… oh, years ago, they told me I had some arthritis in my hips. But it doesn’t bother me too much anymore. I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that. And… oh dear. I’m forgetting something. It was… serious. A long time ago. It's hard to remember all the details. Something about… cancer. It was a long time ago, and they said they got it all. But I don’t remember much else. I’m sorry, my mind is just… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. It’s alright, don't apologize. It's perfectly understandable to have trouble recalling details, especially from a long time ago. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of cancer that was successfully treated… that’s helpful information. Do you recall what type of cancer it was?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s a difficult one. It was… in my stomach, I think. Or maybe… somewhere nearby? They did a lot of tests and… surgery. It was a long time ago. They said it was… early stages. And that they got it all. But the details… they just slip away. I remember being very tired and weak, and my daughter, bless her heart, took such good care of me. But the specifics of what kind of cancer it was… I just don’t recall. I’m so sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, that’s alright. We can try to access your records to get more details if you're comfortable with that. It sounds like you had stomach cancer that was successfully treated some time ago. Now, have you had any surgeries other than the one for the cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed years ago. It was terribly painful, and I was so glad when they finally took it out. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was a young girl. That was a long time ago, before my daughter was born. I don't think I’ve had any other surgeries. Just the gallbladder and the appendix, and the one for the cancer, of course. That’s it, I think. I'm trying my best to remember, but it's hard to keep track of everything after so many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, appendectomy, and surgery for stomach cancer. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. My mother… she had a little trouble with her heart when she got older. And my brother, bless his soul, he had diabetes. He had to watch his sugar very carefully. And… oh, yes. My aunt, on my father’s side, she had cancer. Breast cancer, I believe it was. But other than that… I don’t really know. My family wasn’t one for talking about medical things, if you know what I mean. They just kept to themselves. So, I don't know much about their health history. It's hard to say, really. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart disease in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and breast cancer in an aunt. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, I'm retired, you see. I used to work with animals, training them mostly. It was very rewarding work. Now, I mostly just take care of my little farm. I have a few goats and some chickens. I enjoy spending time with them. I don't smoke, never have. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not very often. I try to stay active, but my joints ache sometimes, so I can't do as much as I used to. I mostly just take things easy these days. It's a quiet life, but I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, used to work with animals, enjoy a quiet life on a farm, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, and limited activity due to joint pain. Thank you. Let me just take a look at your records to see what I can find regarding your previous cancer treatment and other medical history. One moment please.
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, I’m seeing here that you were diagnosed with Stage I gastric adenocarcinoma – that’s stomach cancer – in 2010. You underwent a total gastrectomy, meaning they removed your entire stomach. And thankfully, the pathology report showed clear margins, meaning they got all of the cancer. You’ve had regular follow-up scans since then, and everything has been stable. It also looks like you were treated for pneumonia in 2018. And you have a history of hypertension, which is consistent with what you told me. Your current medications are Lisinopril for blood pressure and calcium supplements. Given your history of stomach cancer and the current symptoms you're experiencing – nausea, loss of appetite, early fullness, fatigue – we need to investigate this thoroughly. The nausea could be related to a number of things, including medication side effects, but given your history, we need to rule out any recurrence or complications related to the surgery.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Recurrence? That sounds… frightening. I was so hoping that was all behind me. I just thought it was… old age, catching up with me. It’s just… it's been so long. What sort of things will you need to do? I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, and know what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Raymonde, and it's good that we're being proactive. While recurrence is a possibility, it’s not the only explanation, and we're going to run some tests to get a clearer picture. First, I'd like to do a physical exam, focusing on your abdomen. Then, I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation or anemia. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be helpful to visualize your organs and see if there are any abnormalities. Finally, depending on the results of those tests, we may need to consider an endoscopy – that’s where we insert a small camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to get a closer look and potentially take a biopsy if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. But yes, Doctor, if that's what you think is necessary, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment. I just hope it's not… anything serious. The endoscopy… that sounds a little unpleasant, but I’ll do whatever you need me to do. When would we do these things? And… will it hurt? I’m a little nervous, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your nervousness, Raymonde. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. We’ll take everything one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything thoroughly before each procedure. First, let's do the physical exam. It won't be painful, just a gentle check of your abdomen. Then, we can get the blood work ordered today, and you can go to the lab whenever it's convenient for you. The CT scan we can schedule for next week, and we can discuss the endoscopy after we have the results of the blood work and CT scan. The endoscopy can be a little uncomfortable, but we can give you medication to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. We’ll also spray your throat with a local anesthetic to numb it. It’s generally well-tolerated, and we’ll monitor you closely throughout the procedure. Okay, let’s start with the physical exam. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whenever you're ready. I just hope everything turns out okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, I'm not feeling any obvious masses or tenderness at this time. Your abdomen is soft, and your bowel sounds are present. However, I do notice some mild bloating. That could be related to a number of things, including your history of surgery and your current symptoms. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. It didn’t reveal anything concerning, but that doesn’t rule anything out, which is why we need to do the blood work and CT scan. I’m going to write up the orders for the lab now. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Just… get the tests done, and find out what's going on. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It… helps to calm my nerves. Do you think… if it is something serious… what are the options? I don't want to be naive, but I’d like to be prepared, if possible.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Raymonde. It's good to be prepared. If the tests reveal a recurrence or complication, the options would depend on the extent and location of the problem, as well as your overall health. Some possibilities include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these treatments. We would discuss all the options in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan that’s right for you. However, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We need to get the test results first. And remember, many things can cause nausea and bloating, and it may not be anything serious at all. Okay, I'm going to get the lab orders printed out now. They'll give you instructions on how to schedule the blood work. Once you have the results, you can call the office, and we’ll schedule the CT scan. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Just… get the tests done. And I’ll call when the results are in. Thank you for your kindness. I appreciate your patience with an old woman and her foggy memory. It's a comfort to know you're taking good care of me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m happy to provide whatever care you need. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t worry about your memory – it’s perfectly normal as we get older. Take care, and I’ll see you when you have the test results. Have a good day.
