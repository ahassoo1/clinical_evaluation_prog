DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, my pee… it’s orange. It started a couple days ago. I don’t… I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That's certainly something we should look into. A couple of days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe three days now? It’s not… painful or anything. Just… the color is strange. Like, really orange. Not normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. I eat the same. Work is the same. Maybe… I drink a lot of water, always have. But I haven't changed that. My wife says I'm still grumpy in the mornings, but that’s normal, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Grumpy mornings are a common ailment! But let's focus on the orange urine for now. Have you noticed any changes in the volume of your urine?
PATIENT: Volume… like, how much? No, I don't think so. It feels… normal. Same as always, I guess. I go to the bathroom… the usual number of times. Not more, not less. It’s just… orange. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No pain, no fever, no… I don’t know… feeling sick. Just the color. It’s a bit scary, to be honest. I don’t understand why it would be orange. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're bringing this to my attention, Criston. It's rarely anything truly serious, but it's always best to investigate. Now, let's go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'm pretty healthy. I work, you know, engineering stuff. Mostly outside. I had a bad back once, a long time ago, but it’s okay now. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. My wife keeps telling me to see a doctor more, but I usually just… push through.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Just the back, like I said, but that was just physical therapy. Lots of stretching. No cutting or anything. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: I understand. Most people don’t! Alright, and what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he was okay, mostly. He smoked a lot, but he lived a long time. Nothing else that I know of, really. We don’t talk about health much. It’s not really a thing in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. I like spicy food, actually. No reactions to anything, ever. My wife always checks when we go to restaurants, but I always say I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. I try to stay healthy, you know? Just… work hard, eat good food, drink water. That's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Criston. That's all very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your overall health and see if we can get any clues about the orange urine. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t want it to be something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just lie down on the table for me, that would be perfect. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Does that cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little pressure, but nothing bad. I get stomach problems sometimes, but it’s not… this kind of pain. It feels okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Now, let’s take a look at a urine sample. We can send that off to the lab for analysis, and that will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be able to provide a sample for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Where should I… go?
DOCTOR: Right through there. There's a collection cup in the bathroom. Just collect a mid-stream sample, and bring it back to me when you're finished. I'll let you have a few minutes of privacy.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Criston. I’m going to send this off to the lab right away. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I’d like you to increase your fluid intake even more, if you can. And if you notice any other symptoms – pain, fever, nausea, changes in bowel movements – please don’t hesitate to call us. While we wait for the results, the most likely explanation is dehydration or a dietary cause. Some vitamins, like those containing beta-carotene, can cause orange urine. But we need to rule out other possibilities. We'll know more once the lab results come back. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. More water, no problem. And I’ll watch for other stuff. Vitamins… I do take a multivitamin sometimes. But not every day. Is it… serious? Should I be worried? My wife is really worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife's concern, and it's good she's looking out for you. Right now, I don’t think there's cause for major worry. Most causes of orange urine are benign. However, it's important to rule out more serious possibilities, which is why we’re sending the sample to the lab. I’m going to order a complete blood count as well, just to get a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. To be on the safe side, I'd also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week, once the lab results are back. We can discuss the results then and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A week is fine. Follow-up appointment, no problem. And the blood test… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now, knowing you’re checking everything. Hopefully it’s just the vitamins.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. It's always best to be thorough. I'll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. And remember, if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call us. Here’s a summary of what we’ve discussed today. We’ve ordered a urine analysis and a complete blood count to investigate the cause of your orange urine. We’ll follow up in a week to discuss the results. We're also increasing your fluid intake. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained it all very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. I'm glad I could help. Please let the receptionist know if you have any trouble scheduling the follow-up. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
