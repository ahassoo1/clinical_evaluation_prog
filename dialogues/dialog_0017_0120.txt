DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Dr. Blim, Family Medicine. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in concise terms, what brings you in today. I have other patients waiting, you understand.
PATIENT: Look, it’s… it’s about having a baby. Or, trying to. My husband… well, he was my husband… always wanted kids. And I’m… older now. I just want to make sure everything’s… working, you know? Before it’s too late. And I don’t want any trouble getting pregnant, if that makes sense. Just… simple.
DOCTOR: “Simple.” Right. Well, Ms. Villarreal, fertility is… not typically simple. But we can certainly attempt to ascertain your current status. Let’s begin with a history. You said you're concerned about your ability to conceive, and your age is a factor. Can you tell me about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, cycles… Honestly? They’re… regular-ish. Sometimes they’re a bit… off. But I mean, who really keeps track of that stuff? It’s not like I need a calendar to know when… you know. I’ve had kids before, so I figured it would just… happen again. It's been a while though, that's all. A long while. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: “Regular-ish” is not a medical term, Ms. Villarreal. And the fact that you haven't bothered to monitor your cycle is… less than helpful. It's crucial information. However, you mentioned having children previously. How many, and when were your last pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Okay, fine. Two. A boy and a girl. It was… ages ago. Let me think… the girl was born in… 2008, I think? And the boy was a couple years before that. 2006, maybe? Something like that. Look, it was a long time ago, I wasn’t exactly writing it down! It feels like another lifetime. Honestly, I don’t understand why we need all this detail.
DOCTOR: “Feels like another lifetime” is precisely the problem, Ms. Villarreal. A lot changes in two decades. And while I appreciate your… casual approach to your medical history, it’s rather inconvenient when trying to establish a baseline. Have you experienced any difficulties with previous pregnancies or deliveries?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Not really. Standard stuff, I suppose. Morning sickness, a bit of swelling. Nothing a sensible woman couldn’t handle. The deliveries were… normal. C-section with the boy, if that matters. But honestly, it was all so long ago, I barely remember. Are you going to poke and prod me now? I really don't have time for a long examination.
DOCTOR: A C-section is highly relevant, Ms. Villarreal. And while your fortitude is commendable, “standard stuff” requires clarification. Were there any complications during either pregnancy or delivery?
PATIENT: Oh, really? What sort of complications? I mean, I was… tired. A little bit of bleeding after the C-section, but the doctors patched me up. They said everything was fine. I think they gave me some antibiotics. Honestly, it was years ago. I'm sure it's all in my records somewhere. I just don't recall the specifics. Look, I’m a busy woman. I don't have time to dissect my entire medical past! Is there anything quick we can do?
DOCTOR: "Fine" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Villarreal. We're going to need to establish a more thorough history before I can offer any guidance. Let's move on from your obstetrical history for a moment. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? No. Well… maybe a little bit of high blood pressure, sometimes. The doctor gave me some pills for it a while back, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. Otherwise, I'm perfectly healthy. I eat reasonably well, I get some exercise… I'm not one of those sickly people. Honestly, I think I’m wasting my time here. Are you sure there's nothing quick you can do? A simple test or something?
DOCTOR: Stopping medication for hypertension is… concerning, Ms. Villarreal. And a “simple test” requires context. Have you been monitored for your blood pressure recently?
PATIENT: Monitored? No. Look, I felt fine when I stopped taking them, alright? I don’t like being on pills if I don’t need them. And honestly, it was a while ago. I don’t see what that has to do with having a baby. I just want to know if I can still have one, not discuss my blood pressure from five years ago! Are you going to ask about my diet next? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is directly relevant to a potential pregnancy, Ms. Villarreal. Uncontrolled hypertension poses significant risks to both you and the fetus. Now, concerning your dietary habits… a balanced diet is crucial for overall health and fertility. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really? Look, I eat normal food. I'm not some picky eater. No shellfish, maybe. And I can’t handle very spicy things. Other than that, I eat what's in front of me. Honestly, I think you're trying to find something wrong with me. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not be interrogated about my lunch! I’m really wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, with all due respect, your cavalier attitude toward your health is… deeply troubling. Given your history—or rather, lack of a detailed history—I cannot, in good conscience, proceed with any fertility assessment at this time. I recommend a comprehensive physical examination and blood work to assess your overall health, including a thorough evaluation of your blood pressure and any underlying medical conditions. I'll write you a referral to an internist and a gynecologist. Perhaps they can elicit a more forthcoming account of your medical background. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
