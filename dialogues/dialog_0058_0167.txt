DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Todoro­vich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my foot is giving me trouble. It’s… a sore, I think. Been there a little while now, and it hurts to walk. It’s on the bottom, near my toes.
DOCTOR: A sore, alright. And how long is “a little while now,” exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe three, four weeks? It started small, like a little scratch. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it got bigger and now… well, it hurts. I try to wear slippers all the time, but it still bothers me.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks. Okay. And is it constantly painful, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I walk. If I sit with my foot up, it feels better. But as soon as I try to go anywhere, it starts to ache. Sometimes it feels like… a burning feeling, too. Not all the time, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Burning, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… when you touch something hot, but not that hot. Just a little sting. And it’s red around the sore. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, with soap and water.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pus or drainage coming from it?
PATIENT: Pus? I… I don’t know what that looks like, exactly. There’s sometimes a little… wetness, I guess. But it’s not much. It’s clear, mostly. Not… yellow or anything. I wipe it off with a towel.
DOCTOR: Okay, “wetness.” We’ll go with that. Have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Oh yes. A few times. Not this bad, though. My wife, bless her soul, she used to take care of them. She had a special cream she used. I… I can’t remember the name of it now. It’s been a few years since she passed.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other medical problems, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse told me when I checked in I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, she called it. I take pills for that. Every morning. And… my feet get cold sometimes. That’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the diabetes pills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the pills for the sugar. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and rice. Not too much sugar, you know. My wife always said moderation is the key.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at this foot. Could you please sit back and lift your leg up on the stirrup?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right away. It’s a little stiff today, sorry about that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There's redness and some swelling around the area. It looks…calloused. And I do see some moisture, as you described. There's a definite indentation, looks like pressure point. I don't see any sign of infection right now, but it's important we monitor it. The skin feels warm to the touch. I'm going to document this as a possible plantar ulcer secondary to diabetes. We'll need to be very careful with this.
PATIENT: Plantar ulcer? That sounds… serious. My wife always said to keep it clean, but… is it bad? Should I be worried? I just want to be able to walk without pain again.
DOCTOR: Well, it can be serious, yes. Diabetics often have poor circulation, and these ulcers can be slow to heal and prone to infection. That's why it's important we address it now. Now, keeping it clean is good, but it’s not enough. You need to avoid putting pressure on it, and we need to ensure your blood sugar is well-controlled. I’m going to prescribe you a special dressing to keep it protected and promote healing. And I strongly recommend you see a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care, especially for patients with diabetes. I'll write you a referral.
PATIENT: A podiatrist… okay. That sounds like a good idea. My wife… she always knew what was best. I miss her advice. The dressing… will that help with the pain? And what about my sugar? Is it too high? I try to take my pills every day, but sometimes I forget.
DOCTOR: The dressing will help protect the area and create a better environment for healing, which can reduce pain. As for your sugar, your levels were slightly elevated on your last blood work. That’s why it’s so important to be consistent with your medication and diet. Forgetting doses can really set you back. I’m going to send a reminder to your pharmacy to call you when your medication is due for a refill. And I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to check your progress. In the meantime, avoid walking as much as possible, keep your foot dry, and please try to remember your pills. Here's your referral to the podiatrist and the instructions for the dressing. Also, a list of foot care guidelines for diabetics. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A few. This podiatrist… do I need to call them myself to make an appointment? And these guidelines… are they in English? My reading isn’t so good anymore. Also, what if the pain gets worse before my next appointment? Should I come back sooner? I don't want it to get infected.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to call the podiatrist to schedule an appointment. The number is on the referral sheet. And yes, the guidelines are in English. If you have trouble reading them, perhaps a family member can assist you. If the pain gets significantly worse – if you notice any redness spreading, pus or drainage, fever, or chills – then yes, you need to come back immediately or go to the emergency room. Do not wait for your follow-up appointment. We want to prevent an infection at all costs. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Thank you for your help. I’ll try my best to remember everything. And I’ll call that podiatrist right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with the podiatrist promptly. And remember, consistency with your medication and proper foot care are key. Have a good day, Mr. Stoegbauer.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
