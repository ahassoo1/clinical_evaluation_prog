DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... chronic fatigue, they said? That’s what the paper says, anyway. Honestly, I just feel… tired. Really tired. All the time. It's been going on for... a while now, I think. I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, chronic fatigue… I see that here. And you're right to say it's been going on for a while. It’s very common for things to creep up slowly. “Really tired,” you say. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… hard to explain. Not just sleepy, you know? It’s like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of bed. And it doesn’t get better with rest, not really. I could sleep all day and still feel drained. I used to be so active... before. What was I doing before...? Oh dear. This is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No, not at all embarrassing, Ms. Licano. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things, especially when you're feeling unwell. And what you’re describing—feeling drained even after rest—is a key part of understanding what’s going on. So, you said you used to be very active… Can you recall what activities you enjoyed, and about how long ago did you start noticing this change?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I used to garden, a lot. Big vegetable garden. And… walk. Long walks in the woods. Before… my husband, Stefan, got sick. And then… after. It's all a bit of a blur, really. I guess it started getting bad… maybe a year or two ago? Hard to say. Everything feels like it’s blending together these days. It’s been… a difficult few years. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Licano. Thank you for sharing that. A lot of change and stress can certainly affect how we feel. It sounds like you've been through quite a lot. Okay. Let's try to get a clearer picture of your current symptoms. Besides the fatigue, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… achy. All over. And… I get headaches. Not terrible, but… frequent. Oh, and I’ve been… forgetful, obviously. My daughter keeps telling me I repeat myself. It’s… frustrating. I try to keep busy, but it's hard when I can't remember what I was doing. I don't sleep well, either. Just… restless. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. Achiness, headaches, forgetfulness, restless sleep… We’re building a good picture here. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My regular doctor… Dr. Petrov… he checked me for… something. A few years back. Something with my… thyroid, I think? He said it was okay. Mostly just high blood pressure, and he puts me on medication for that. I take it every day. And… I had my gallbladder out years ago. Before Stefan got sick. Does that count? I honestly can't remember much beyond that. Everything feels so… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and gallbladder removal. That’s good to know. And Dr. Petrov checked your thyroid and said it was normal. We'll be sure to verify all of that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat… mostly everything. My daughter is always telling me to watch my salt, because of the blood pressure. But… allergies? No. I don't think so. But, again, my memory… it’s just not what it used to be. Could she be right and I’m forgetting something? This is so frustrating.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel frustrated, Ms. Licano. And it's good that you're aware of your memory issues. We'll take things slowly. No known allergies, that’s good. Now, let’s talk about medications. You mentioned taking something for your blood pressure – could you tell me the name of that medication, and how much you take?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see… I have it right here. rummages in purse… Ah, here. It’s… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I take one every morning with breakfast. I think. Unless Dr. Petrov changed it. Oh dear. It’s probably on the bottle, isn't it? This is just awful. I used to be so organized.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once daily. That’s good. And it’s okay that you’re unsure if Dr. Petrov made any changes, we can verify that as well. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had… heart problems. She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes. He lost his leg, eventually. Stefan’s mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis. And his father… he had cancer, I think. Lung cancer. It was a long time ago. Everyone always died of something, it seems like. This isn't very helpful, is it? I'm just… recalling things vaguely. I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Licano, it is helpful. It gives me a better understanding of your overall health picture. History of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in the family… it’s important information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask a quick question about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I never touched a cigarette in my life. Stefan… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago. Before he got sick. He was always trying to get me to try, but… no. Never liked it. And I don't drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s it. Mostly I just… try to keep busy. When I have the energy, that is. Can we… get this over with? I just feel so tired.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Good to know. And I understand you're feeling tired. We'll get through this as quickly as we can. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick. This chair is… uncomfortable. And I really do feel quite faint. leans back slightly, closing eyes I just want to go home and lie down.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as quick as possible. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Ears look normal, throat is clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little… discomfort. But I think that’s just… general soreness. It’s hard to say. Everything aches these days. grimaces slightly Is that… normal? To feel this bad all the time? I just want this to be over. Please.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Licano, it's understandable to feel discomfort, especially given your symptoms. And it's not uncommon to feel aches and pains when you’re dealing with chronic fatigue and stress. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what's going on. This will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… please send me home. I really don't feel well. I just want to sleep. Is there anything… anything wrong? Is it something serious? wrings hands nervously Don't tell me it’s cancer, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Licano. We're ordering these tests to rule out any serious underlying conditions, and to get a better understanding of the cause of your fatigue. We'll check all the basics first. We’ll also repeat your thyroid tests to confirm Dr. Petrov’s findings. It's important to remember that fatigue can have many causes, and it’s often not cancer. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. I'm going to write a referral for a neurology consult, as well. We’ll want to rule out anything neurological contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Neurology…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… can I get a copy of the referral and the blood work request? I want to show my daughter. She… she worries about me. And honestly, I’m too tired to remember everything you’ve said. leans forward, looking pale Please… just help me get home. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. Here's the referral to neurology, and the blood work request. I'll also have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion for you to share with your daughter. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available – usually in about a week. The nurse will assist you with scheduling that before you leave. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us. I’m going to write you a prescription for a sleep aid, just to help you get some rest while we await the results. Does that sound good?
