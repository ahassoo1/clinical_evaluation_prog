DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like… a heavy weight, you know? Like someone is sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: I see. A heavy weight on your chest… that sounds concerning. Can you tell me a bit more about this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three days ago? It’s not sharp, more like… dull. And it comes and goes. When I walk up the stairs, it gets worse. Sitting still, it’s not so bad. I was making arepas yesterday, and it felt a little tighter then, but maybe that’s just from standing for so long? I don't know. It just... worries me. My husband, Ricardo, he said I should come in.
DOCTOR: That’s good of Ricardo to encourage you to come in. It’s always best to get things checked out when you’re concerned. So, it started about three days ago, is a dull ache that comes and goes, worsens with exertion like walking stairs, and seems to be relatively stable at rest. You also noticed it felt a bit tighter when standing while making arepas. To get a better understanding, can you tell me where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. Mostly in the middle. Sometimes it feels like it goes a little to the left side, but mostly right here. Not in my back, not in my arm… just here. It’s hard to explain, it’s not one spot, it’s more… spread out. Like a big ache all over this part of my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a more diffuse discomfort in the center of your chest, potentially radiating slightly to the left. And it’s not traveling into your back or arms. I’m going to ask a few more general questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. First, have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, I don’t think. No cough. I was a little breathless yesterday when I was carrying groceries up the stairs, but I always get a little breathless with the stairs. I haven’t felt dizzy. Oh! And I’ve been a little… tired. But I’m always a little tired, you know? It’s August, it’s hot. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So no fever, cough, or dizziness. You've noticed some breathlessness with exertion, which you attribute to the stairs, and some general fatigue. The fatigue is good to note. It is August and it can be hot, but we want to consider everything. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I get a little heartburn sometimes, after I eat spicy food. But this… this is different. This is more… a heavy feeling. And the heartburn is more in my throat, you know? This is deep in my chest. I’ve never had a pain that feels like this before. I worry because my mother, she had some heart trouble when she was older. But I don’t remember exactly what it was… it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new type of pain for you, distinct from heartburn. And there's a family history of heart trouble with your mother, though you don't recall the specifics. That's important information. I'd like to ask about your medical history now, if that's alright. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me think… the doctor, he told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel dizzy. Now I just… try to eat healthy. No sugar, lots of vegetables. Ricardo always makes sure I get my vegetables. And no, I don’t have sugar problems, the doctor checked that too. He said everything was fine. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just getting older now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were diagnosed with high blood pressure in the past, were prescribed medication but discontinued it due to dizziness, and currently manage it through diet. You've been checked for diabetes and it was negative. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s a cream, I rub it on at night. And sometimes, when my stomach is bothering me, I take a little pink pill. But that’s it. Oh! And a multivitamin, sometimes. Ricardo buys it for me, but I forget to take it every day. He reminds me, but I forget. It’s in the kitchen, on the counter. A little orange bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you use a topical cream for arthritis, a pink pill for stomach upset as needed, and occasionally take a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, Doctor! Colombian food has everything in it. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Ricardo always checks when we go to new restaurants, but I’ve never had to tell him anything. No allergies, I don't think. I might be a little sensitive to dust, sometimes, but that’s just a little sneezing. Not an allergy, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication or food allergies, and only mild sensitivity to dust. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! Absolutely not. My mother, she smoked when she was young, but I never liked it. It smelled terrible. Ricardo doesn't smoke either. We both like fresh air. No, no smoking. Never.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine, sometimes. With dinner, on a special occasion. Ricardo likes a beer sometimes, too. But not every day. Maybe once a week? Or less. We don't drink very much, Doctor. It’s not really a habit. We prefer juice! Mango juice is our favorite.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional, moderate alcohol consumption. That's good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your work and daily activity level?
PATIENT: I am a transportation inspector, Doctor. I check the buses, make sure they are safe. It's mostly walking around, looking at things. I don't lift anything heavy. And I walk a little every day, to the store, with Ricardo. We like to walk. But it gets hot, so sometimes we stay inside. It’s not a very active job, honestly. Mostly just looking and checking. I try to stay busy though! It’s good to keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work as a transportation inspector, which involves moderate activity, and you walk with Ricardo daily. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Chelberg. It’s very helpful. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Go ahead. It’s just… this pain worries me, you know? So if you can check everything, that would be good. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold! I get chilly easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Chelberg. I understand your concern, and we'll do a thorough check. And yes, I will be mindful of keeping you warm. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… good. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. That could be related to fluid buildup, or just normal variation. I'll need to correlate that with your history. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That is a bit elevated. It’s not drastically high, but it’s something we need to monitor. Finally, I will gently palpate your chest to check for tenderness. I don't feel any significant tenderness in your chest. There's some mild muscle tightness, but nothing alarming. Okay, Ms. Chelberg. I have finished the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Does this pain feel like it is radiating anywhere else at the moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, it’s still just here, in the middle of my chest. Not going down my arm, not up to my neck, not to my back. Just here. And it feels a little… tight, like someone is squeezing my chest. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a heavy weight. Like I said before. And it's a little worse when I breathe in deep. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain remains localized to the center of your chest, described as a heavy tightness that worsens with deep breaths. That’s important information. Given your history of slightly elevated blood pressure, the crackles I heard in your lungs, and the description of your pain, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to angina – chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. It could also be something musculoskeletal, or potentially related to a respiratory issue. It’s hard to say definitively without further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I’m thinking an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a cardiac enzyme level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. I want to know what’s going on. My husband, Ricardo, he worries so much. I don't want to worry him unnecessarily. Is it going to be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor's appointment next week for my arthritis, and I’d like to know before then, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Chelberg. These tests are standard procedures and will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and rule out any serious problems. The EKG is completely painless – we simply place some stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work involves a simple blood draw, which may cause a brief pinch. And the chest X-ray is also painless; you’ll just stand in front of a machine while it takes a picture. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours, so we should have them before your arthritis appointment next week. I will personally review them and contact you as soon as they are available to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No worsening of the pain, shortness of breath, dizziness… emergency room. Okay. So tests, then you call me with the results. Where do I go for the tests? Are they here at the clinic? And… will my insurance cover it? I have Medicare. I don’t want to get a big bill. Ricardo is always worried about money.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Chelberg. We’ll get everything sorted out. The EKG and blood work can both be done here at the clinic. We have a lab just down the hall. I’ll write you an order for both. The chest X-ray will need to be done at the imaging center across the street, at 123 Main Street. They accept Medicare, and our clinic has a direct billing arrangement with them, so there shouldn’t be any issues with coverage. However, it’s always best to confirm with them directly before the appointment to be absolutely certain. Their number is 555-1212. I’m printing out the orders now. They’ll have everything they need to bill Medicare correctly. And I’ll have my nurse, Maria, go over the instructions with you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Maria will help me with the instructions, and I’ll call the imaging center to confirm the insurance. Thank you so much. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something to find out what’s going on. Ricardo will be so relieved. He worries so much. I think I'll just sit here a moment and catch my breath before I go. It was a little stressful, thinking about everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. It’s perfectly understandable to feel stressed, and it’s always better to be proactive. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Maria will be in shortly to assist you. Please don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you may have. And just to reiterate, if your pain worsens at any time, please go to the nearest emergency room. Have a good day, Ms. Chelberg. And please, take care of yourself.
