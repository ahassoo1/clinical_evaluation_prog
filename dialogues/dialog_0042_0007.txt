DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pain. In my back. It’s been… troublesome. I’d like to get it sorted, if possible. I don’t have much time today.
DOCTOR: Okay, a troublesome back pain. I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll do our best to be efficient. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… about three weeks ago, I think. Maybe a little longer. I was… putting up fence. For Mr. Henderson’s cattle. It’s heavy work, you understand. Lifting posts, stretching wire… and then it just… caught. A sharp pain. It hasn't gone away completely since then.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to have started with a specific incident – lifting while putting up fence. That gives us a good starting point. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a deep ache, mostly. But when I move… certain ways… it’s a sharp pain. Like a… a knife, almost. It goes right across my lower back. Not down my legs, though. Not yet, anyway. I’m… worried it might go down my legs. My father had trouble with that, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep ache with sharp pains upon movement, localized to the lower back. And you’re understandably concerned about the possibility of it radiating down your legs, given your father’s experience. That’s helpful to know. Does anything make the pain better – like rest, or certain positions?
PATIENT: Rest… helps a little. Lying flat, with a pillow under my knees. That takes some of the pressure off. But… I can’t lie around all day. I have work to do. And… sitting isn't good either. Makes it worse. Especially if I have to twist or bend. I mostly stand now. Though even that isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright, so rest with a pillow under your knees provides some relief, but sitting and twisting aggravate it. Standing isn’t great, but better than sitting. Before we move to a physical exam, let’s get a bit of your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much. Just… arthritis, in my hands. The doctor told me years ago. It flares up sometimes, but I manage it with… over-the-counter things. And… I had pneumonia, when I was younger. A long time ago. That’s all. Oh… and my late husband… he had diabetes. I didn’t have it myself. Medicare covers me, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m a widow now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. Arthritis in your hands and a history of pneumonia, and your husband's diabetes – noted. It’s good to know about your Medicare coverage as well. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital except for the pneumonia. I’ve always been… careful. Hard work keeps you strong, mostly. But… this back pain is different. It’s not something I can just… push through. I’m not getting any younger, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you've always been resilient, but this pain is concerning enough to seek medical attention, and that’s the right thing to do. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had heart trouble. Later in life. And like I said, my father had back problems. Bad ones. Ended up in a wheelchair, he did. That’s why I’m worried about this going down my legs. He… he said it felt like electricity, shooting down. That’s what I’m scared of. It wasn't just pain. It was… something else. I don’t know the proper words. I didn't pay much attention to medical talk back then.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, Ms. Reihner. Heart trouble in your mother and your father's back problems are important details. And you're right to be concerned about the possibility of similar symptoms. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen. When the arthritis flares up. And sometimes, for the back pain, if it gets really bad. It doesn't help much, though. Not really. I try not to take too much. It’s… hard on the stomach, you see. And I take a multivitamin, every day. That's all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and back pain, and a daily multivitamin. No known allergies, correct?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with that. No. I can eat anything. I… I haven’t changed anything in my diet. I eat mostly… traditional foods. Frybread sometimes, but not too much. It's… not very good for you. I try to be sensible. Just the pain… it’s constant now. It wears you down. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and a mostly traditional diet. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Reihner. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your back to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. Just… be gentle, please. It’s… sensitive. I’d like to get this done as quickly as possible. I have work waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Could you please stand with your feet shoulder-width apart?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? I haven’t been moving much, because of the pain. It’s… hard to explain. It hurts to bend, you see. Especially bending forward.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I notice some slight guarding in your lower back, but no obvious deformities. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you sit on the exam table, please?
PATIENT: Yes. Be careful, please. It’s… right there. In the small of my back. That’s where it hurts the most. You’ll feel it. I know you will.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just checking your reflexes. I notice a slightly diminished response in your left Achilles tendon, but everything else appears normal. Now, could you lie flat on your stomach for me?
PATIENT: Yes. This isn’t comfortable. It’s… pressing on it. But I’ll try. Just… hurry, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling along your lower back muscles now. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes! Right there! That’s where it hurts the most. It… shoots down my hip a little. Just… be careful. It’s really sensitive. And… that lifting thing… it felt like something popped when it happened. I remember that much. I’d like to know if you think it’s serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I definitely feel some tenderness and muscle spasm in your lower right back. The pain radiating down your hip is also concerning. Based on the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a muscle strain or sprain, possibly with some involvement of the surrounding nerves. The feeling of something “popping” is also something to consider. I’m not ruling out a disc issue at this point, though. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back. This will help me rule out any fractures or other structural problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays… yes. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t want to… waste time. If it helps you figure out what’s wrong, then yes. But… how long will it take? I have work to do. And… will Medicare cover it? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Reihner. The X-rays should only take a few minutes. The imaging technician will need about 10-15 minutes to position you and take the images. Results usually come back within 24-48 hours, and I'll have my staff contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. And yes, Medicare should cover the X-rays, assuming we document the medical necessity appropriately, which I will do. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan, but my staff can verify that for you. We’ll confirm all of that before proceeding. Would you like me to have my staff schedule the X-rays for you now?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Just… as soon as possible. I need to know what’s wrong. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? To help the pain? Something I can take, or a position I can try? I’m not just going to sit around, you understand. I have work to do. Just tell me what I can do while I wait for the results.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. While we wait for the X-ray results, I recommend the following: Continue to rest when possible. Avoid activities that aggravate your pain, but don't completely immobilize yourself. Apply ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. This will help reduce inflammation and pain. You can continue taking ibuprofen, as long as you are tolerating it well and don’t have any stomach issues. Please follow the dosage instructions on the label. Try gentle stretching exercises, such as knee-to-chest stretches. But stop immediately if you feel any pain. Maintain good posture when sitting or standing. A warm compress might also help - alternate between warm and cool. I’m also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help ease the spasms. It may cause some drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. I’m going to have my staff schedule the X-rays and send the prescription to your pharmacy. We’ll discuss the results and create a more comprehensive treatment plan at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… acceptable. Muscle relaxant… alright. I'll try it. Just… make sure my pharmacy knows which one it is. I don't want any mistakes. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to get this sorted quickly. I have work to do. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. My staff will ensure the correct medication is sent to your pharmacy and will double-check everything. I understand you have work to do, and we'll do our best to get you back to feeling your best as soon as possible. Here are some written instructions detailing the above information, and the details about your X-ray appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you, and have a good day.
