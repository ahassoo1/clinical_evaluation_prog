DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. So, you're here today… for what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes. It's… well, it's about getting something to prevent HIV, if that makes sense. I think it's called PrEP? A friend mentioned it, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. I'm getting on in years, you know, and better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: PrEP. Yes, I’ve heard of it. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's… becoming more common. Honestly, at your age, I wouldn’t have immediately thought of that being a concern, but… everyone’s different, I suppose. Let’s get some background. Do you have any risk factors that make you think you need this medication?
PATIENT: Risk factors… hmm. Well, I’m single, haven't been with anyone long-term in… a very long time. And I travel a bit, for family. Mostly to visit relatives, but… you meet people. It's just… I want to be careful. Is that enough of a risk? I don’t really… do anything reckless, if that’s what you mean. Just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: “Prepared” is… a broad term. Traveling can increase risk, certainly, if you’re engaging in unprotected sexual activity. Although, frankly, I still don't quite understand the concern. Let’s go through some basics. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Several times. When I was younger, definitely. And… um… let me think… maybe five years ago? A general checkup. Everything was always clear, thankfully. I have the records somewhere, if you need them. Though, I wouldn't even know where to begin looking right now. It's been a while. It’s all good, though. I'm clean, I know that much.
DOCTOR: “Clean” isn’t a medical term, Ms. Trefren. We need documented results. Regardless, since it’s been five years, a recent test is required before starting PrEP. It’s standard procedure. Now, aside from sexual activity, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Not really. High blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. And a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing… serious. Medicare covers everything, thank goodness. I don’t want to be a bother with anything complicated. Just this PrEP thing, if it’s right for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, on medication. That's… important to know. We need to ensure PrEP won’t interact negatively with your current regimen. Do you know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Honestly, I just let the pharmacy handle it all. They know what they’re doing, I assume. I don't bother with memorizing names, it just confuses me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril… not a major interaction, but we'll need to monitor your kidney function closely if you do start PrEP. PrEP can sometimes affect kidney health, and Lisinopril already impacts that. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to penicillin when I was a child, but that was ages ago. I haven’t had it in… well, decades. Everything else is fine. No reactions to anything they’ve given me at the doctor’s office, nothing like that. Except maybe that dye they use for the X-rays, it always makes me a little itchy, but it goes away quickly.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy… documented. The dye is… not relevant. Now, before we proceed any further, I need to perform a basic physical exam. Specifically, I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll need a blood sample for an HIV test and to assess your kidney function. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Get on with it, please. I have… errands to run this afternoon. And honestly, the sooner we know, the better. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please expose your arm. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Minimal wheezing. Now, we'll need a blood sample. The nurse will be in shortly to draw that. It will take about 10-15 minutes. We'll discuss the results and next steps once we have them. Do you have any questions before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… the nurse, right? And then we’ll… know something? Look, is this going to take all afternoon? I really do have things to do. And will the nurse… hurt? I’m not good with needles.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in momentarily. And no, it shouldn’t hurt. A brief pinch, that’s all. We will have preliminary results in a few days, but complete results will take approximately two weeks. I understand you have things to do, Ms. Trefren, but these tests are necessary. The nurse will explain everything. I’ll be with you once the results are available. Please remain seated. Honestly, some patients…
