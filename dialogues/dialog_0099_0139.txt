DOCTOR: Right. Yamir Shanor, 31 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, that’s right. I need… checkup. For referee. They want me to get checked before I start. For fitness. It’s for… sports.
DOCTOR: A fitness checkup for refereeing, is it?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes! They say… important. I run a lot. And… stand a lot. Need to make sure okay. Before… you know. Games. I don't want to fall down. Is that… enough explanation?
DOCTOR: It’s… sufficient. Though frankly, most people come to me with actual complaints. Running and standing… well, most people do that. But alright. So, let’s try to be a bit more specific. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Not really. Sometimes… back is little sore. After long games. But I just… rest. It goes away. Nothing… serious. I think. I don’t… go to doctor often.
DOCTOR: "Little sore" could mean a number of things. And avoiding the doctor doesn’t make something less serious, Mr. Shanor. When you say “long games”, how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes three hours. With… overtime. It's basketball. Lots of running up and down. And… people are big. They bump into me. It’s okay, though. Usually. Just… want to be sure before season starts. Don’t want to… make things worse.
DOCTOR: Right. Basketball referee. Three-hour games with potential for… contact. And you’ve just been resting a sore back. Do you notice any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No. Not down legs. Sometimes… little numb feeling in feet. After game. But I think… shoes. Bad shoes. I need to buy new shoes. Is that all? New shoes fix it? I hope.
DOCTOR: "Think" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Shanor. And relying on new shoes for something that could be… well, a number of things, is rather optimistic. We’ll need to take a closer look. Let’s start with a quick physical exam. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Scale. Right. I hope it's not too… bad. I eat okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: 134 pounds. And your height is 174 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Uh… is that… too little? I used to be… bigger. After… my wife… I don't eat so good. But I run a lot. Maybe that make up for it? I don't know. Stop thinking about that. I need to focus on referee.
DOCTOR: We'll get to the root of that later. For now, let's proceed with the exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Is this… cold? I hope it's quick. I have things to do. Need to practice signals. For the games.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness upon palpation in the lumbar region, as expected. No obvious signs of acute injury. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. It's… tight. Not so good. I'm not very flexible. Never was. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, as expected for someone who isn't particularly active. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please, turn your head to the side.
PATIENT: Okay. I always feel silly doing this. Like… at the dentist. What are you looking for? Is something wrong? I hope it's not serious. I really need to… referee.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Sensory function appears intact. Now, just a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Please, take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… okay? I sometimes cough. Especially… in the winter. But it's usually nothing. Just… a cold. I think.
DOCTOR: Mild wheezing noted on auscultation. History of winter cough… Could be a mild case of asthma. Or simply a lingering effect from a previous respiratory infection. Let's get some blood work done to rule out anything more serious. And a chest X-ray. Just to be certain.
PATIENT: Blood work? X-ray? That sounds… bad. Is it… serious? I just wanted a checkup for referee. Not… all this. I don't like needles. And… radiation. Is radiation bad? Can I still referee? I need to referee.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, you came in with vague complaints and a desire for a "checkup". We're simply being thorough. The blood work will give us a baseline and rule out any underlying issues. The chest X-ray will confirm the condition of your lungs. It's standard procedure. As for whether you can still referee… that depends on the results. We need to know what we’re dealing with before making any decisions. Now, I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Don’t fret, it’s a quick procedure. And the radiation exposure from a single X-ray is minimal. Honestly, the stress you’re experiencing right now is probably more damaging.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, fine. Blood work and… X-ray. But… can I at least practice my signals afterwards? I have a game next week. I need to be prepared. Please? Just let me practice. It will help me calm down. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Shanor. But after the blood work and X-ray. And if the results are concerning, you will be focusing on recovery, not refereeing. Now, the nurse will be in shortly. Please, try to relax. Though frankly, I doubt you will. .
