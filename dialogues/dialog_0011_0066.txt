DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… well, it’s hard to describe. A popping, or clicking sensation in my back. It doesn’t hurt constantly, but it happens frequently enough that it's become concerning. Mostly when I’m moving, or twisting.
DOCTOR: I understand. A popping or clicking sensation in your back that occurs with movement, and isn't associated with constant pain – that certainly warrants investigation. To help me get a clearer picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly where it’s coming from. It feels like it’s somewhere in my lower back, but sometimes it feels higher up, closer to my mid-back. And it’s not always the same spot. As for when it happens… like I said, twisting is a big one. Bending over, sometimes even just getting out of a chair. It doesn’t seem to happen when I’m standing still, thankfully. I work on trains, you see, so I’m constantly moving and reaching. It’s probably related to that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Mastrantonio. Knowing it’s somewhat variable in location – lower versus mid-back – and that it’s connected to movements like twisting and bending is helpful. And your occupation as a train worker certainly provides context. To further understand this, let's go through a few questions, if you don't mind. First, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the most intense discomfort you’ve experienced with this clicking sensation?
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I’m happy to answer whatever you need. Hmm, the most intense… it’s rarely truly painful. More like a sharp, momentary… awareness. I’d say, on a scale of zero to ten… probably a three, maybe a four on a bad day. It doesn’t radiate or anything, it’s just… there, for a split second. And it doesn’t last. It doesn't keep me from doing anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know it’s not radiating and doesn’t significantly impede your activities. A three or four, intermittent and momentary, is certainly less concerning than constant, high-intensity pain. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this clicking?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No numbness, tingling, or weakness in my legs or feet. No fever or chills. No bowel or bladder problems. Nothing like that. I have felt a little stiffness in my lower back in the mornings, but I just assumed that was from sleeping, or from working all day. But no, nothing that I would consider a significant symptom accompanying the clicking itself. I haven’t noticed any swelling either, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that thorough response, Mr. Mastrantonio. No radiating symptoms, no bowel or bladder changes, no fever, and just some mild morning stiffness – that is all very helpful information. Now, let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any significant past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Nothing major, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a child, like everyone else. I broke my wrist when I was younger, playing baseball, but it healed perfectly. And I had my appendix removed about fifteen years ago, but that was a routine procedure and I recovered without complications. Other than that, I've been fairly healthy, all things considered. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which my family doctor monitors. I take a low dosage medication for that, but it's well-controlled.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, childhood chickenpox, a healed wrist fracture, an uncomplicated appendectomy fifteen years ago, and well-controlled hypertension – that’s good to know. And you’re currently taking medication for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily. I’ve been on it for about five years now. My doctor checks it every six months or so, and it’s always within a normal range. I don’t experience any side effects from it, thankfully. I’m generally a very healthy person, despite the clicking sensation in my back.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily, well-tolerated and stable blood pressure – that is good information. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to medications, food, or anything else, as far as I know. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm actually quite fortunate in that regard. My wife is allergic to shellfish, but that's the only allergy in the family, as far as we know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mastrantonio. No known allergies is helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… my father had heart disease, he passed away when he was 78. My mother had arthritis, but it wasn’t severe. And my older brother has type 2 diabetes, but he wasn’t diagnosed until he was in his fifties. Other than that, no major medical conditions that I'm aware of. My family generally lives to a fairly old age, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. History of heart disease in your father, arthritis in your mother, and type 2 diabetes in your brother – that is helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been married to my wife, Elena, for twenty years now. We have two grown children, both living and working in Miami. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I work on trains, as I mentioned, which keeps me pretty active, though it's not always the best for my back. I don't engage in any particularly strenuous physical activities outside of work. I enjoy gardening and reading in my spare time. And I try to eat a healthy diet, although it’s not always easy with my work schedule.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Mastrantonio. That gives me a very good understanding of your lifestyle. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, active job, and relatively healthy lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Mastrantonio. I'm noting some mild tenderness to palpation along the lower lumbar spine, specifically at L4-L5. Your range of motion is slightly limited in forward flexion, but otherwise appears relatively normal. I'm also checking your reflexes and sensation in your lower extremities, which are intact. I do not note any muscle weakness. Based on my initial examination, the clicking sensation in your back, coupled with the mild tenderness I’ve detected, suggests possible muscle strain or ligament sprain. However, to rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some X-rays of your lumbar spine. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. Muscle strain or sprain is what I was suspecting as well, given my occupation. I’m happy to get the X-rays done, if that’s what you recommend. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write an order for lumbar spine X-rays, and the receptionist will schedule an appointment for you at the imaging center. Once the results are in – typically within 24 to 48 hours – we can review them together and discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. You can also apply ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Avoid any strenuous activities that aggravate your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That all sounds very manageable, Doctor. Ibuprofen and ice packs, avoid strenuous activity… I can certainly do that. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this time. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. The receptionist will be with you shortly to schedule your X-ray appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results.
PATIENT: .
