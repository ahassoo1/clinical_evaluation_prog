DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bacy, you say? That’s a nice name. Well, now… let me think. It’s my ears, I believe. Things haven’t been as clear as they used to be, you see. Not at all. I mostly just ask folks to speak up, but my daughter said I oughta get it checked. She worries somethin’ awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, I understand. It sounds like you've been experiencing some hearing loss. And it's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in – it's always helpful to have someone looking out for us. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the change in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice… that’s a tricky one. Seems like it’s been a slow thing, really. Not like all of a sudden, you know? Maybe… a couple of years now? It’s hard to say, to be honest. I used to be able to hear the birds sing so clearly, but now… not so much. And the television… I have it turned up pretty loud, I reckon. My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, mentioned it once. Said she could hear it from her garden!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it is hard to pinpoint sometimes. A gradual change like that is common. So, it’s been a couple of years, and you’ve noticed difficulty hearing birds and needing the television louder. Do you notice it more in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… certain situations… let me think. Yes, I believe so. When there’s a lot of noise, it’s awful. Like at the grocery store, or when my grandkids are all over, chattering away. It all just… blends together. And restaurants are bad too. I mostly just nod and smile, hoping I don’t agree to somethin’ I shouldn’t! It's quieter at home, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse in noisy environments, and better when it's quiet. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears, even when it's quiet?
PATIENT: Ringing… buzzing… Oh, now and then, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, I suppose. Not all the time, mind you. It comes and goes. Mostly when I’m trying to sleep, I think. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it’s there. It’s like a little cricket chirpin' in my ear, but not as pleasant. I just try to ignore it, really. It usually fades after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ringing in your ears, especially when trying to sleep. That’s good information. Now, have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work, or perhaps through hobbies like hunting or attending concerts?
PATIENT: Oh, work, yes. I worked in a shoe factory for… goodness, nearly forty years! Lots of machines, clatterin’ and whirrin’ all day long. Never thought much of it at the time, you know? Just part of the job. They didn't give us earplugs or anything like that back then. Concerts… not really. I wasn’t much for all that loud music. Mostly just quiet evenings at home with the radio on.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of noise exposure at the shoe factory, but not much elsewhere. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any problems with dizziness or balance issues?
PATIENT: Dizziness… balance… Hmm. Well, now that you mention it, I have stumbled a couple of times lately. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a little wobbly now and then. I figured it was just getting old! I do feel a bit unsteady sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. But I haven’t fallen or anything like that. My daughter keeps telling me to be careful. She worries so.
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't fallen, but feeling unsteady is something we should investigate further. And it’s good your daughter is looking out for you. Now, have you had any ear infections, ear pain, or discharge from your ears at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Oh, goodness, I think I had one as a child, maybe? A long, long time ago. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. No ear pain lately, and certainly no discharge. My ears don’t itch or feel blocked or anything like that. Just… hard of hearing, mostly. I’ve always had good luck with my ears, aside from this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible ear infection as a child, but no recent issues with pain, discharge, or blockage. That's good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. The doctor told me I had a touch of high blood pressure a few years back, but he put me on a little pill for it. I take it every morning. Aside from that… nothing much, really. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I do get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just part of getting old, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication. And I understand the feeling of getting a little tired as we age. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands. Makes them a bit easier to work with, you know? I take it every evening. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something for that, too. Nothing regular, mind you. Just when I really need it. I think that’s it. Mostly just the blood pressure pill and the arthritis one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, and occasional sleep aid. Thank you for letting me know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My daughter’s a bit sensitive to pollen, but I seem to be alright. No, I don’t think I have any allergies at all. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Don’t ask for much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Schneer, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I’m ready when you are. I just hope it doesn’t take too long, you know? I promised my daughter I’d be home for tea.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t take long. First, I’m going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope. This just helps me see if there’s any wax buildup or inflammation. Alright, I see a little bit of wax in both ears, but nothing major. The ear canals themselves look clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a little bit fast, but consistent with blood pressure medication use. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’ll just do a quick balance test. Could you please stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Wax, you say? Never bothered me none. Closing my eyes… yes, of course. Oh dear, I am a bit wobbly, aren’t I? My daughter says I’ve got to be careful. I can feel myself… sort of… drifting.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are a little unsteady, Mr. Schneer. That’s alright, it’s good we’re checking this. It's helpful to have a support nearby. Let's sit back down now. Okay, so based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing hearing loss, possibly related to age and previous noise exposure, and some balance issues. The wax buildup could be contributing to the hearing loss, but it doesn't seem to be the main cause. The slight unsteadiness needs further investigation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So it is my ears, then? And the factory, you think? Well, that doesn’t surprise me none. I always figured all that clatterin’ couldn’t be good for a fella. Balance issues… that worries me a bit, I must say. I don’t want to fall and break a hip! What do we do about it, Doctor? Will I need a hearing aid? And what about my balance? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Schneer. Let's address them one by one. It’s very likely the noise exposure at the factory contributed to your hearing loss, along with the natural aging process. Regarding your balance, it’s hard to say if it’s serious without further testing. It could be related to your hearing loss, or something else entirely. We need to rule out other potential causes, such as inner ear problems or even medication side effects. To start, I recommend a hearing test, called an audiogram, to determine the extent of your hearing loss and see if a hearing aid would be beneficial. I'm going to order that for you right away. I'd also like to order a balance test to further assess your stability. We can send you to a specialist for that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test… yes, that sounds sensible. And a balance test… well, I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? If it’ll put my daughter’s mind at ease, I’m willing to do it. Who do I see for the balance test? And how long will it take? And will it be expensive? My Medicare… does it cover everything? I worry about these things, you know. Old age is expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schneer. It's good you're thinking about these things. For the balance test, I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, she's an excellent specialist here in town. Her office is located at 14 Oak Street, and their number is 555-123-4567. They'll schedule an appointment for you. The test itself usually takes about an hour. As for the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of both the hearing test and the balance test. However, there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. I recommend contacting your Medicare provider directly to confirm your coverage. The office staff at both Dr. Reed’s office and the audiologist’s office can also help you navigate the billing process. I’ll also write a note for your primary care physician, just to keep them informed. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. To write a note for my doctor. And the numbers for the offices… yes, that’s helpful. I’ll have to ask my daughter to help me make the calls. I’m not so good with all that technology these days. I think… no, I don’t think so. That covers everything, for now. You’ve been very patient with an old man, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. Remember, if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing or balance, such as dizziness, severe pain, or ringing in your ears, please contact my office immediately. We'll get you scheduled for those tests, and we'll go from there. Have a good day, and please give my best to your daughter. .
