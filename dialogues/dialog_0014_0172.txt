DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Good to see you… or, well, to meet you. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Engelhaupt. Candice Engelhaupt. Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest why I’m here, precisely. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in. We just moved, you see. From… well, a place. He worries terribly. It’s all quite unnecessary, if you ask me. Just a social call, I believe? Honestly, these things are such a bother.
DOCTOR: Right. Settling in. Your husband is concerned. I see. Well, even if it is just a check-up, it’s good to get a baseline when you move, Candice. Just to make sure everything's as it should be. It’s… responsible. Now, are you experiencing anything at all?
PATIENT: Experiencing? Goodness. At my age? One experiences everything. Aches, mostly. And the general… decline, naturally. But nothing specific I can put my finger on. I feel… adequately unwell, if that makes any sense. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: "Adequately unwell." Yes, well. That's... descriptive. Luncheon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, with the Garden Club. We’re discussing hydrangeas, you see. A very important topic. Honestly, these doctors always take so much time. Is there a questionnaire I can fill out? Perhaps that would expedite things.
DOCTOR: There is a form, yes. Though it mostly asks about things you’ve likely told other doctors a dozen times. It covers medical history, allergies, medications... the usual. We need it for the record, of course. While you're doing that, let me just quickly listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take a minute.
PATIENT: Oh, more paperwork. Honestly. My history is quite unremarkable. A few childhood illnesses, nothing serious. And I can assure you, Doctor, I am not allergic to anything. I’ve eaten everything. Everything, I tell you! Do go on with your… listening, then. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: If you could just… loosen your clothing and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It's just a quick check. Breathe deeply for me, if you would. Good… and again. Your breathing is a little… wheezy. Not terribly concerning, but something to note. And your heart rate is a bit fast. Do you experience any… shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Goodness, no. Though I do occasionally get a bit… winded climbing the stairs. But who doesn’t? It's a perfectly normal consequence of aging. Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I’m unwell? I assure you, I’m perfectly capable. I simply don't appreciate being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Right. Normal consequence of aging. Of course. Now, let’s try to get a bit more information. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not particularly. Though my shoes have been a bit snug lately. But that’s likely due to the heat. It's been dreadfully warm, you know. And I do have rather… substantial ankles. Always have. It's a family trait. Honestly, you doctors are always looking for something to worry about.
DOCTOR: Substantial ankles. Right. Family trait. Well, it's good to rule things out. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Oh, heavens, no. I eat perfectly well. Though I suppose I haven't been as enthusiastic about… liver lately. My husband makes a dreadful liver pâté. Honestly, it's quite unappetizing. But that's hardly a medical concern, is it? A matter of taste, really.
DOCTOR: No, not a medical concern, necessarily. Alright. And… are you sleeping alright?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Oh, tolerably. I wake a bit during the night, naturally. One does, at my age. A little creaky, perhaps. And my husband snores. Dreadfully. Honestly, it's enough to drive one to distraction. But I manage. Perfectly manage.
DOCTOR: Right. Manage. Let’s see… Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, Doctor, where doesn’t one have pain at my age? My knees ache, my back complains, my elbows get stiff… It's all rather commonplace. Honestly, it's the price one pays for a long life. Are we nearly done? I really must be going. The hydrangeas won't discuss themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. It sounds like you’ve… a number of typical age-related aches and pains. However, given your slightly elevated heart rate and the wheezing I heard, and just to be cautious, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. Just to rule out anything serious. It’s a routine precaution. We can get those done here at the clinic.
PATIENT: An X-ray? An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, are you quite serious? All this fuss over a few aches and pains? It’s quite unnecessary. And frankly, rather alarming. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. I simply require a nice cup of tea and a comfortable chair. I think I’ve had enough of this nonsense. I believe I’ll seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Very well, Candice. You’re, of course, entitled to a second opinion. However, I strongly recommend you reconsider. These tests are quick, painless, and could provide valuable information. Ignoring potential problems won’t make them go away. If you change your mind, please let the receptionist know. Otherwise, I’ll document that you declined further testing. .
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. A complete waste of my time. And yours, I imagine. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. And I assure you, I will not be returning. Good day to you.
