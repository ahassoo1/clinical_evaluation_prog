DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, I suppose. Though I’ve seen better days, and frankly, younger doctors. It’s…well, it’s my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make me notice. And a man always notices these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. Blood in the stool is definitely something we want to check out. Just to clarify, how long have you been noticing this blood?
PATIENT: Oh, now don't go rushing to conclusions. It’s not like I’m dropping dead here. A couple of times, maybe? Over the last week or so. Honestly, I haven’t been keeping a detailed log, if that’s what you’re expecting. A man has things to do, you know. Flying isn’t exactly a sedentary profession, even in retirement.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. A couple of times in the last week. And you said it wasn't a large amount?
PATIENT: No, it wasn't gushing, if that’s what you’re thinking. More like…streaks. Like someone took a red pen to it. Not pleasant, I assure you. And it's not every time, mind you. Most times it’s…normal. As normal as it gets for a man my age, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, streaks of blood, not with every bowel movement. Has the color been consistent, or has it varied at all?
PATIENT: Color? Really? You want me to describe the color of my…well, you know. Honestly, doctors these days. It was…red. What color should it be? Look, I'm not an artist. It wasn’t black, if that’s what you’re worried about. That’d be…unsettling.
DOCTOR: You’re right, that wasn’t a very helpful question. Sorry about that. Just trying to gather information. Not black is good. Has there been any change in your usual bowel habits otherwise?
PATIENT: Habits? I go when I need to go. What’s to change? Though…now that you mention it, it hasn’t been as solid as it usually is. A bit… looser. But I chalked that up to the peaches. My granddaughter brought me a whole basket. They're awfully juicy.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools along with the blood, and you think that might be related to the peaches. Have you had any stomach pain, cramping, or nausea with any of this?
PATIENT: Nausea? Heavens, no. A man doesn't get nauseous. Maybe a bit of discomfort, a little grumbling in the gut, but nothing a good cup of coffee can’t settle. Stomach pain…well, my back’s always a bit achy. I used to haul a lot of equipment, you know. Flying isn’t all glamour.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no nausea, a little discomfort, and some looser stools. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Arbie?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that is a good question. My granddaughter keeps telling me I need to eat more. Says I’m looking…thin. But I’ve always been a lean man. Maybe a pound or two? It's hard to say, I don’t weigh myself obsessively like some people I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible slight weight loss. And you said you're not insured, is that correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. Never saw the point of it. Always healthy as a horse, until…well, until things like this happen. Waste of good money, if you ask me. Though, I suppose I’m here now, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbie. Given your symptoms, and your age, I think we should do a quick physical exam, and I’d like to order a stool test to check for any bleeding or infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A stool test? Good heavens. Honestly. Is that really necessary? I mean, I've told you what it looks like. But…fine. Do what you have to do. Just…try not to dwell on it too much, alright? It's not exactly a pleasant subject. And a physical? I suppose. Just be gentle, my back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbie. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with listening to your abdomen, and then I'll just take a quick look at your back. Then we’ll get the sample for the stool test. It’s a pretty straightforward process. Would you mind if I take your blood pressure and pulse while we're at it?
PATIENT: Blood pressure, too? Honestly, it’s like I’m falling apart here. Fine, go ahead. Just…let’s get this over with. I’ve got a documentary on the history of bush planes I’m trying to watch this afternoon. And honestly, I doubt poking and prodding will tell you anything you don’t already know.
DOCTOR: Alright, abdomen sounds normal. No obvious tenderness. Now, let's check your back. Can you just bend forward slightly for me, and tell me if any of that feels painful?
PATIENT: Oof. There. Right there. A bit of a twinge. Not sharp, but…uncomfortable. Old injury, I suspect. Hauled a lot of radio equipment back in the day. Bad back ever since. Don't poke too hard, alright? It's sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There's some muscle tenderness there, as you said. Nothing alarming, but it explains the discomfort. Alright, let’s get that stool sample. I’ll give you the instructions and a container. It’s best to collect a small amount from three different bowel movements, if possible. There's a bathroom right down the hall.
PATIENT: Three times? Good heavens. This is becoming a whole ordeal. Alright, alright. Just…try to be quick about it. And for goodness sake, don’t tell anyone about this. A man’s dignity, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. Your privacy is my top priority. I’ll leave you to it, and I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. The lab is just down the hall, so you can drop it off on your way out. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Seems…self-explanatory enough, sadly. Just…try not to think about it too much. And don't tell my granddaughter. She worries enough as it is. Now, if you'll excuse me… this is rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbie. I completely understand. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be right outside.
