DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Well, it ain’t nothin’ wrong, exactly. Just…curious, I guess. Thought I should get checked out, see how things are doin’. You know, regular stuff. I don't really know what all I should be lookin' at, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Regular stuff,” huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. I work on boats, see? Lot of oil, lot of sun. Figure it’s good to make sure nothin' bad is buildin' up or somethin’. I got Medicare, if that helps. It's been a while since I just...had a check-up, you know? Not sick, just bein' careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, preventative care is…commendable, I suppose. Though, usually people come in with something bothering them. Oil and sun exposure…right. Okay. So, to get a better idea of what “checking things out” means for you, let’s start with the basics. Any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Nah, no pain. Not really. Maybe a little achin' after a long day on the boat, but that's just old muscles, I think. Like, my back'll be a bit sore liftin' stuff, but I ain't worried 'bout that. It goes away when I rest. I ain't never had nothin' serious happen, if that helps. Mostly just bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: “Mostly just bumps and bruises.” Right. And what about anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get tired easier than I used to, maybe? Workin' long shifts, could be that. And sometimes I feel kinda…off, like I’m forgettin' stuff, but I also work really long hours, so I just figured it was that. Not like, big important stuff, just… where I put my keys, or what I was 'bout to say. Is that somethin' to worry 'bout?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, like… small things. Not like losin' whole days or not knowin' who people are. Just… moments. Like, I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went in there, you know? Or I'll be talkin' and the word I want just...vanishes. It ain't happened every day, but it's been happenin' more lately. Is that a sign of somethin' bad? I really don't know much 'bout this stuff.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Uh… probably a few months, maybe six months? It’s hard to say for sure. Things get kinda blurry when you're workin' all the time. It started slow, just little things. Then, like I said, it started happenin' a bit more. I figured it was just stress, honestly. Work's been kinda hectic. But… I thought I should get it checked, just in case. It ain't gettin' worse fast, but it's still… there. You know?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to do a quick neurological assessment. Just some basic tests to see how things are functioning. And then we’ll take a look at your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. Never had high blood pressure or diabetes. I try to eat okay, when I can. It’s hard on a boat, lots of fast food sometimes. But I haven’t been to the hospital for nothin' serious, if that helps. Just cuts and scrapes, mostly. And a broken arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. You wanna check my blood pressure now? That sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your vitals. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature… then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. And, as I mentioned, a brief neurological exam. Just to be thorough. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here you go. I ain't nervous or nothin', Doc. Just want to make sure everything's okay. You think this could be somethin' serious? Workin' on boats is all I know, so… it'd be bad if I couldn’t do it anymore.
DOCTOR: Well, let’s not jump to conclusions. We haven't even started yet. Blood pressure is… 138 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll monitor that. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay, done. Sounds good, right? Everything normal? I get kinda worried when I hear doctors talkin' 'bout things bein' 'irregular'. Makes me think somethin's broke or somethin'. My ex-wife was always tellin' me I worry too much. But, hey, better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, we'll do some simple tests to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. I need you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, I can do that. Like this? Is that good? I used to be real good at track in high school. Good eyesight then, anyway. Hope it ain't gone bad now. This is kinda weird, though, lookin' at somethin' that's movin' like that. Makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stop there. You seemed to have a slight…nystagmus. Involuntary eye movement. And you mentioned feeling dizzy. Hmm. Now I need you to stand up slowly. Can you walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, I can do that. Straight line? Like this? I ain't real good at balance, never was. But I can walk, Doc. Just… a little unsteady sometimes. Is that somethin' bad? This ain’t feelin’ good, to be honest. I feel kinda… off. Like I'm gonna fall over.
DOCTOR: Okay, sit down. Now. I’m concerned about your balance and coordination. Given your reported forgetfulness and the nystagmus, combined with the gait instability… We need to rule out a neurological issue. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain. And a referral to a neurologist. I also want some blood work done to check for vitamin deficiencies. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI? Neurologist? What… what's wrong, Doc? Is it somethin' serious? Like… a tumor or somethin'? My grandpappy… he had some kinda brain problem when he got old, and he… he forgot everything. Is that what's happenin' to me? I'm gettin' scared, Doc. I just wanted a check-up. I don’t want no MRI.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Heindel, I’m not saying you have a tumor. I’m saying we need to rule things out. This isn’t about scaring you; it’s about being thorough. The forgetfulness, the nystagmus, the instability... these could be a sign of something serious, and we need to investigate. Ignoring it won’t make it go away. The neurologist is the specialist; they'll be able to give you a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test, it’ll give us a clear picture of your brain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. You think… you think it could be somethin’ bad. And I need to see this… neurologist. And get this… MRI thing. But what if it is somethin’ bad, Doc? What if I can’t work anymore? Workin' on boats is all I know. What am I gonna do? Is there… is there anythin’ else it could be? Like… stress, or a vitamin thing? Anythin’ before we jump to… brain stuff?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, I understand your anxiety. And, yes, it could be something less serious. Vitamin deficiencies can cause neurological symptoms. Stress can contribute to forgetfulness. But we can’t rule anything out without proper testing. Jumping to conclusions will only make things worse. The blood work will help us identify any deficiencies. And the MRI will give us a clear picture of your brain. It’s the responsible thing to do. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, she's an excellent neurologist. And I’ll order the blood work now. We need to gather as much information as possible. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay… Dr. Sharma. I’ll… I’ll see Dr. Sharma. And the blood work… I guess. How long does the MRI thing take? And… and is it gonna hurt? I hate needles, Doc. Always have. And… what if they find somethin’? Will they… will they have to… operate? This is… this is too much. I just wanted a check-up.
DOCTOR: The MRI takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll lie perfectly still inside a large machine. It’s not painful, although some people find it claustrophobic. As for the blood work, it’s a standard procedure. A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm. It’ll sting for a moment, but it’s over quickly. And as for whether or not you'll need surgery... we don't know that yet. We haven’t even seen the results of the tests. Worrying about surgery now is premature, and frankly, unhelpful. I’m ordering the tests, and you need to schedule them as soon as possible. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can determine a course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, I understand. Schedule the tests. Dr. Sharma… MRI… blood work. I’ll… I’ll do it. When will I get the results? And… and do I need to bring anythin’ to the MRI thing? Like… ID or somethin’? Just… just tell me what I need to do, Doc. I just wanna get this over with.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. As for the MRI, the radiology center will give you specific instructions when you call to book the appointment. You'll likely need to bring a form of identification and your insurance card. And it’s best to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, anything magnetic. As for the results... it typically takes a few days for the radiologist to review the images, and then Dr. Sharma will contact you to discuss them. I'll also forward the results to her office. Is there anything else?
