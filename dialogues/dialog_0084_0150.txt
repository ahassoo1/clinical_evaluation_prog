DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about having a baby. And I want to do it right. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I want to make sure there aren’t any…problems. I’ve heard stories. Terrible stories. I don’t want to waste time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're thinking ahead and want to be proactive. “Doing it right” is a smart approach. Let’s gather some information so we can figure out the best path for you. First, are you currently trying to conceive, or are you just starting to plan?
PATIENT: Planning. Definitely planning. I’m…particular about these things. I need to know everything is optimal before anything happens. I'm not one for surprises, and frankly, I'd like to be as certain as possible it won’t be…difficult. I've been divorced for some time, and I don't want complications.
DOCTOR: Alright, planning is excellent. We can definitely do a thorough workup to assess your overall health and identify any potential obstacles. It’s good to be prepared, especially with a previous divorce – you’re right to want to minimize complications. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else your regular doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: No. None. I take very good care of myself. I eat…reasonably well, I exercise, and I see my doctor for checkups when I absolutely have to. Nothing chronic. I do have Medicare, of course, but that's just because of my age, not because I'm sick. I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Medicare just means you’re being responsible and taking advantage of available resources, and doesn't indicate any illness at all. Okay. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just a…cosmetic procedure, years ago. Nothing important. A little something to…refine things. It was decades ago, and completely unrelated to…this. Honestly, I don’t see what that has to do with anything. I'm perfectly healthy. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going through a checklist?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. We ask about everything to get a complete picture. Even seemingly unrelated procedures can sometimes have subtle effects. Okay, moving on. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Now we’re digging into that. My family is…complicated. My mother lived to a reasonable age, but she had…issues. Let’s just say she had a difficult time with…things. She had children, obviously, but it wasn’t easy for her. And my father…well, he wasn't around much. I don’t really know his side of the family. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand that can be a sensitive topic. Knowing your family history helps us identify potential risks, even if it's just to be aware. It doesn’t mean you will have the same issues, but it helps us to be prepared. Were there any specific health problems that your mother had – like heart disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer, or any problems during pregnancy?
PATIENT: She…struggled with her nerves. Always anxious. And she had a…difficult time carrying to term with my youngest brother. He was…premature. Very premature. And she had high blood pressure, I think. Or maybe it was just the stress. Honestly, she was a mess. It’s a relief I didn’t inherit that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of anxiety and high blood pressure in your mother, and premature birth with your brother. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Do I look like someone who would do those things? I maintain a very…refined lifestyle. I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally—a very small glass—but that’s it. And definitely no smoking. It’s dreadful for the skin, you know. And recreational drugs? Preposterous.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Shteynberg. It's just standard questions. It's good to hear you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I take something for that. Nothing regular, really. Just when needed. I prefer natural remedies when I can, but sometimes…a little something is necessary. Is that all? Can we finally get to the actual tests? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional joint supplements. Good to know. Yes, we can move on to the tests. Before we do that, I'd like to ask about any allergies you have—to medications, food, or anything else. Then, we can discuss some initial blood work and potentially a pelvic exam to assess your overall health and reproductive system. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I've never had a problem. I eat everything. I’m not a picky eater. Blood work, fine. A…pelvic exam? Must we? Is that absolutely necessary? I’m not comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Shteynberg. A pelvic exam is helpful in assessing the health of your reproductive organs, checking for any abnormalities, and ensuring everything is functioning as it should. It's a routine part of preconception care. However, we can certainly discuss alternatives. We could start with the blood work and review your results. If anything concerning arises, then we could revisit the possibility of a pelvic exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Just the blood work. For now. But I expect a thorough explanation of everything. And I want the fastest possible turnaround time. I don’t have time to wait around. And no unnecessary tests, please. I’m not made of money.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll order a comprehensive panel to check your hormone levels, assess your overall organ function, and screen for any potential infections. I'll ensure the results are expedited as much as possible. We’ll also check your rubella immunity, and screen for any sexually transmitted infections, as part of standard preconception care. I'll personally review the results with you and explain everything in detail, and we'll only order further tests if necessary. Let me get the lab order for you. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it done. Quickly. And make sure the lab understands I don’t have a lot of time to spare. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. The order is submitted to the lab now. They should be ready for you. It’s located just down the hall, and the front desk can direct you. They will likely need your insurance information. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can have the results sent directly to my office, or you can pick them up and bring them with you. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it’s quick. And make sure your staff understands I’m not to be kept waiting. I have a schedule to keep. Honestly, I’m glad we’re finally getting somewhere.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. We will make every effort to accommodate your schedule. My staff is aware of your concerns, and we'll prioritize getting you the information you need as quickly as possible. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
