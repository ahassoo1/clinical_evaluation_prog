DOCTOR: Hi Mande, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Polczynski, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It's happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hmm, tired and yellowing… and it seems to be linked to fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I didn’t really put two and two together at first, but then it happened again after I had some with a salad last week. It’s not every time I eat them, but often enough to be worrying me. I haven’t changed anything else in my diet or routine.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say “yellow,” where are you noticing that color change?
PATIENT: Mostly my skin, I think. And the whites of my eyes… they look a bit off, too. Not a bright yellow, more… a pale, sickly kind of yellow. It's hard to explain. It goes away after a few days, but then it comes back when I eat the beans.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long would you say this has been happening in total?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's been on and off for maybe… six months now? At first, it was just happening rarely, and I didn’t think much of it. But the last two times have been pretty noticeable, and that's why I decided to come see a doctor. It's starting to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of this on and off. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and the yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my stomach feels a little upset after the beans, kind of like cramping. And… maybe a bit weak, generally. Not like a fever or anything, just… lacking energy even before the tiredness sets in. Does that make sense? I don't know if that's related, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach cramping and general weakness alongside the tiredness and yellowing. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses when I was a kid, but nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was younger, but that was years ago and everything healed fine. No ongoing conditions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed years ago, otherwise healthy. Any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix. And… I’ve had a couple of wisdom teeth taken out, if that counts. But nothing serious, really. No other operations or anything like that. I usually avoid going to the doctor unless I absolutely have to!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s about it. My father was healthy as a horse, always working in the garden. No one else in the family has any major health problems that I know of. We don't really talk about medical things much. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, father healthy. Now, just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat pretty much anything, which is why this whole thing with the fava beans is so confusing! It's not like I'm suddenly allergic to something; it feels… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… normal food, mostly. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a treat now and then! I haven't been taking anything regularly for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin and the whites of your eyes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. It's probably a good idea to check everything out properly. I'm a bit nervous, but I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Now, let’s take a look at your skin… I do notice a slight yellowing of your skin, as you mentioned. And yes, your sclera—the whites of your eyes—also have a yellowish tint. It’s subtle, but it’s there. It's consistent with what you described. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called favism. It’s a condition caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called G6PD, which makes your red blood cells vulnerable to damage from substances in fava beans. It can cause the symptoms you’ve described - tiredness, yellowing, and stomach upset. However, to confirm this, we need to do a blood test to check your G6PD levels. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Favism… that sounds… serious. A deficiency? So, my body isn't making something it needs? And it’s all because of the beans? I’ve always enjoyed them in salads. A blood test sounds reasonable, yes. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then please go ahead. It's a bit frightening to think something I eat could be causing this, but I'd rather know for sure what’s going on. What happens if it is favism? Is there a treatment?
DOCTOR: It can sound frightening, yes. And it is good to get to the bottom of it. It's more common in people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Asian descent, and Romania is in that region. If it is favism, the primary treatment is avoidance of fava beans and other substances that can trigger the reaction, like certain medications. The reaction itself is usually mild and resolves on its own, but in rare cases, it can be more severe and require hospitalization. We’d also want to avoid certain medications that could worsen the condition. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a G6PD enzyme assay. We'll also check your bilirubin levels, as that can indicate liver involvement. I’ll have the lab draw those samples now. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend strictly avoiding fava beans and anything containing them. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Avoid the beans, no problem. I can definitely do that. Bilirubin levels, G6PD… I’ll try to remember all of that! It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. So, just to be clear, if it is favism, it doesn’t mean I can never eat anything again, just… no more beans? And avoid certain medications too. I can make a list of everything I eat, just in case. I’m happy to have the blood drawn, Doctor. Let’s get it done, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to reiterate, avoiding fava beans is the main thing. And we'll review a list of medications with you once we have the results, just to be safe. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Mande’s blood?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I'm not usually one for needles, but if it helps figure this out, I'll brave it. It's just... the thought of having to change my diet is a bit depressing. But I suppose health comes first. I guess I’ll just try and think of all the other things I can eat!
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel that way. It is a change, and it's okay to be a little anxious about it. Many people live very full and healthy lives while avoiding certain foods. And we’ll do everything we can to help you adjust. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, I'll write a note for your primary care physician summarizing our conversation and the tests we've ordered. Do you have any other questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything so well. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'm just… relieved to finally be getting some answers, and to be taking steps towards figuring this out. I'll try to stay positive and focus on what I can eat! Thank you again. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse then.
