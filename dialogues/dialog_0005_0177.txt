DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... something with down there. My, um… my boy. It's been… leaking. A little. Not a lot, but… it’s there. It’s kinda embarrassing to talk about, you know? I don’t usually talk about these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's what I'm here for. It's not easy discussing these things, I understand. “Down there,” you say… leaking. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… a month? Two? I don't keep track of these things. Time just kinda… goes. It started after… well, after the one night with that sailor. Young fella, he was. Didn't mean for it to happen, you know? Old ladies shouldn't be… never mind. It’s just been… there. A little wetness. Not painful, just… icky.
DOCTOR: Right. A month or two. And this occurred… following a recent sexual encounter. I see. And you’re saying it’s not painful, just… discomforting. Has there been any change in odor, or color?
PATIENT: Oh, color? I don’t know about color! I just see wet. Like, not clear, you know? A little… yellow-ish maybe? And it smells… kinda bad. Like fish, I think. Or old socks. It’s hard to say, honestly. I don’t sniff my… business. Don't you think that's silly? I just know it doesn't smell like flowers.
DOCTOR: "Fishy" odor… and yellowish discharge. Hmm. Alright. And are you experiencing any burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Everything goes… regular. I mean, I have to go a lot, being old, you know? But it doesn't hurt going. Just… feels normal. Old lady problems, probably. I don't know why I'm even here, wasting your time. It’s just… a little leak. Shouldn't young people be seeing doctors, not me?
DOCTOR: “Old lady problems” as you put it, are still medical problems, Ms. Genard. And they still require attention. It’s good you came in. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh dear. Well… I suppose. As long as it’s quick. And you won't… you won't be too rough, will you? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And try not to stare. It’s embarrassing enough as it is. What exactly are you looking for, anyway?
DOCTOR: I need to check for any signs of infection, inflammation, or discharge. We’ll just take a look, it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. I'm looking for the source of the leak, basically. Now, if you could just lie down on the table, we'll get this over with. I’ll need you to put your feet in the stirrups when I’m ready.
PATIENT: Stirrups? Oh, goodness gracious. I haven’t been in stirrups in… well, a very long time. Are you sure you need me to do that? Couldn't you just… look? It feels like a lot of trouble for a little leak, you know? My hips are kinda stiff today.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, with all due respect, a proper examination requires a proper position. Stirrups allow me to visualize everything I need to see to determine the cause of the discharge. It’s not about making trouble; it's about getting you a diagnosis. Now, are you able to get onto the table?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Don’t get yourself in a twist. But be gentle, you hear? And don't look at me like that. It’s not a zoo exhibit. Here we go… Oh, my goodness. This is harder than it looks. You young people have it easy.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Ms. Genard. I’m going to gently position your legs. Now, let me know if you feel any pain. Hmm… Yes, I see some redness and irritation. And there is a noticeable, yellowish discharge. Is this normal for you?
PATIENT: Normal? Goodness no! I’ve never had anything like this before. A little… dryness, maybe. But not all this… yucky stuff. It feels kinda swollen, too, now that you mention it. It's probably that sailor's fault, isn't it? Bad boy. I shouldn't have trusted him. Old ladies and sailors don't mix. It's probably something awful, isn't it? Something you young doctors have a fancy name for? Oh dear. I'm going to be sick.
DOCTOR: It appears you have a case of bacterial vaginosis, likely contracted through sexual activity. It's a common infection, Ms. Genard, and easily treatable with antibiotics. It's not something to be alarmed about, although it is important to address it to prevent any further complications. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Bacterial… what-now-sis? Sounds dreadful. Antibiotics? Will those make me sick? I don't like taking pills. And how did I even get bacterial what-sis? Is it something I have to tell my family about? Oh dear, this is just awful. And what about that sailor? Should I… should I tell him? He probably gave it to other people! This is all his fault. I'm going to be sick again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of bacteria naturally occurring in the vagina. It's not a sexually transmitted disease, although sexual activity can sometimes trigger it. The antibiotics will help restore the balance. You don't need to tell your family, and you don’t need to contact the sailor. It’s a fairly common infection. Now, I’m going to prescribe you a course of metronidazole. You'll take two tablets twice a day for seven days. Do not drink alcohol while taking this medication. It can cause a very unpleasant reaction. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Metroni… what-now? Two pills twice a day? That's a lot of pills! And no alcohol? But I like a little wine with dinner. Oh dear, this is just a nightmare. Allergic? Um… I don't think so. I used to take something for my arthritis, but I don't remember what it was called. It was a long time ago. And it made me sleepy. Very sleepy. But I don't know if I'm allergic. Maybe. I don't keep track of these things, you know? My memory isn't what it used to be. This is all so complicated! Can't you just give me something simple? Like a cream? Or a potion?
DOCTOR: A cream wouldn’t be effective for this particular infection, Ms. Genard. And I'm a doctor, not a… potion maker. The metronidazole is the standard treatment. And frankly, it’s the best option. Now, regarding your arthritis medication, it's important to know if you experienced a severe reaction— hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face—or just drowsiness. Drowsiness is a side effect, not an allergy. I'm printing out instructions on how to take the medication, as well as a list of potential side effects. Do you understand that you need to complete the entire seven-day course, even if you start feeling better?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hives? Swelling? I don't remember! It was years ago, you know? Everything gets jumbled up in my head. I just remember feeling sleepy. Very sleepy. Like I could sleep for a week. And I think I got a little dizzy. But maybe that was just old age. And yes, I understand about the pills. Seven days, even if I feel better. That's a long time to take pills. What if they make me sleepy? I have Mahjong on Wednesday! And I can't miss that. Oh dear, this is a disaster. A disaster! Can’t you just give me something to make me feel better now? A little something to take the edge off?
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I am prescribing you an antibiotic to treat your infection, not to make you feel better instantly. Taking the full course is crucial. There's nothing I can give you to counteract potential drowsiness. If you feel drowsy, simply avoid activities that require alertness. Here are the instructions, as well as information on potential side effects. I've also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to ensure the infection has cleared. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Oh dear. More doctors' visits? This is just awful. Awful. Well, I suppose… no, I don’t think so. Unless… what if it doesn't work? What if I'm still leaking? And still smelly? And still feeling awful? What then? Will I have to come back again? Oh dear, this is just a nightmare. I should have just stayed home and suffered. It would have been easier. Well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I hope I don't have too much trouble getting home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, if the symptoms don’t improve after completing the full course of antibiotics, or if they worsen, please schedule another appointment. And try to get some rest.
