DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I believe you have the notes regarding my… recent dietary experiment? It was, shall we say, a bit… extreme. I’m hoping you can have a look and tell me if I’ve done myself any lasting harm. It involved a great deal of cabbage, and very little else, for a surprisingly long period.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see the notes here regarding your…cabbage-focused diet. “Surprisingly long period” is a good way to put it. Thank you for clarifying. To get a better understanding of what's been going on, could you tell me a little more about why you decided to try this diet, and for how long exactly did you maintain it?
PATIENT: Ah, well. It began rather innocently, actually. A young man – an animator, as am I – was boasting about a new technique he’d developed to render… well, never you mind what he was rendering. He claimed it was inspired by a particularly rigorous fasting regime, a sort of… purification, he called it. He'd lost a great deal of weight, you see. Being a rather competitive fellow – and perhaps a touch vain, if I’m honest – I thought I’d give it a try. As for how long… let me see. I began on the first of May, and continued until… well, until yesterday, actually. That would be roughly three months. Three months of cabbage, Doctor. It was… a commitment.
DOCTOR: Three months. That is a commitment, as you say. And primarily just cabbage?
PATIENT: Yes, primarily. There was the occasional carrot, for vitamin content, you understand. And a small amount of… I believe it was parsley, for flavour. But the vast majority was cabbage. Boiled, steamed, occasionally pickled. A rather monotonous existence, I assure you. One begins to dream in shades of green, you know. And the smell… a rather pervasive odour, even now. I apologize if I’ve brought any of it with me. It's proving… remarkably persistent.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. Vantine. I understand. Three months of such a restricted diet is quite significant. And it’s not surprising it's left a lasting impression, in more ways than one. Let's talk about how you've been feeling during those three months, and how you're feeling now. Have you experienced any weight loss, changes in your energy levels, digestive issues, or anything else that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Well, the weight loss was… substantial, initially. Rather gratifying, I must confess. Though, towards the end, it slowed considerably. One reaches a point, you see, where the body begins to… resist. Energy levels… that was a more problematic affair. A distinct lack of vigour, I’m afraid. A certain… lethargy. And digestive issues? Oh, yes. Quite a symphony of discomfort, if I’m honest. A great deal of… rumbling. And bloating. And a… shall we say, a certain urgency when nature calls. It made travel rather… inconvenient. One must always know the location of the nearest facilities, you understand. I also noticed a rather peculiar… weakness in my hands. Made sketching rather difficult, which was a considerable concern, as it is my profession, you see. And a general feeling of… coldness, even in warm weather. It’s difficult to describe. A sort of… internal chill. I hadn't associated it with the diet at first, but now… it seems rather likely to be connected.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Vantine. That gives me a much clearer picture. The weight loss, lethargy, digestive issues, hand weakness, and feeling of coldness are all concerning symptoms, particularly given the length of this diet. Before we proceed, have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. I hadn’t specifically considered it, but now that you mention it… yes, I believe I have. My skin feels… rather dry, and somewhat… flaky. And my hair… it seems to be thinning, perhaps a little more than usual. Though, one does get older, you know. It's difficult to attribute it solely to the cabbage. But yes, a noticeable decline in its… robustness, certainly. It lacks its usual… sheen. And the texture… it’s become rather… brittle. Like straw, almost. Not a flattering comparison, I admit. I haven’t been styling it as much lately, to be honest. Less noticeable that way, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That’s very helpful. Dry skin, flakiness, and thinning hair are all consistent with potential nutritional deficiencies. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. By all means. I trust your professional judgment implicitly. I’ve always found a thorough examination to be the most sensible course of action. Do let me know if anything seems… amiss. I rather suspect my hands will be the most revealing, given my earlier observations. Though, I confess, I’m not entirely certain what one looks for when assessing the health of one’s hands. I leave that to the experts, naturally. Proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, but not critically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, your hands… I do notice some dryness and flakiness, as you mentioned. Your nail beds appear a little pale, and I'm noting some slight tremor in your fingers. And there’s a subtle decrease in muscle mass. Verbalizing for documentation: “Hands exhibit dryness, pallor, tremor, and mild muscle atrophy.” I’d also like to check your reflexes. I test his reflexes. They seem a little sluggish. Verbalizing for documentation: "Reflexes are diminished bilaterally." Finally, I'll just take a look at your skin overall. I examine his skin for any rashes or lesions. It appears generally dry and slightly scaly. Verbalizing for documentation: "Skin is dry and scaly, with no acute lesions noted." Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it appears you may be experiencing some nutritional deficiencies as a result of this restrictive diet, likely including Vitamin B12, iron, and possibly others. We'll need some blood work to confirm this. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and Vitamin B12 and iron levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… entirely sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems a prudent course of action. I confess, I wasn't entirely surprised to hear of potential deficiencies. Three months of cabbage, after all… it’s hardly a balanced diet. Vitamin B12 and iron levels… yes, those names ring a bell. Important things, I believe. I trust your judgment implicitly. Proceed as you see fit. I shall endeavor to remain optimistic, though I suspect a return to a more… varied culinary regime is in order. Perhaps a nice piece of fish? Or a well-prepared roast? One must counteract the cabbage, you see. Do let me know when the results are available. I await them with… a degree of trepidation.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vantine. I’ve ordered the blood work, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you start reintroducing a variety of foods into your diet. As you mentioned, fish and roast are excellent choices. Focus on lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It’s important to do this gradually to avoid any digestive upset. I also want to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms, so I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the blood work results and formulate a more comprehensive plan. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. A week sounds perfectly reasonable. Gradual reintroduction of foods… a sensible precaution, indeed. One wouldn't want to overwhelm the system after such a… prolonged period of monoculture. And ruling out other causes… prudent, as always. I appreciate your thoroughness. I shall endeavor to adhere to your dietary recommendations in the meantime. Perhaps a small portion of salmon tonight? And a side of… well, anything but cabbage. I believe I've had my fill for a lifetime. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least to a degree. I await the results with… cautious optimism. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any specific symptoms I should monitor in the meantime?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Vantine. Yes, please monitor for any worsening of your fatigue, any new digestive symptoms – particularly severe abdominal pain or bloody stools – and any changes in your mental state – such as confusion or memory problems. While those are less likely, it’s always best to be vigilant. Also, if you experience any new muscle weakness or numbness in your extremities, please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, focus on rehydrating and getting adequate rest. And, as you said, anything but cabbage! I’ll see you next week to discuss the results and get you back on track. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. Fatigue, digestive issues, mental state changes, muscle weakness… I shall endeavor to be acutely aware of any such developments. And I assure you, the cabbage will remain firmly banished from my diet. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… diplomatic approach to my dietary indiscretion. It was, shall we say, a learning experience. And one I shall not be repeating. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I look forward to our follow-up appointment next week. I’ll endeavor to arrive with a more… optimistic outlook. And perhaps a story about a slightly less extreme animator. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before our next appointment. Have a good day, and try to enjoy some non-cabbage-related meals in the meantime!
