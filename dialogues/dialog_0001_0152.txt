DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, Mrs. Geho, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, the nurse, she told me some numbers weren't so good. Something about my cholesterol being high? I don't really understand all that, to be honest. It's just… I got a letter and she said I should come talk to you about it. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, the numbers. Right. Look, a lot of folks get high cholesterol. It’s… common. The nurse probably flagged it because it's above what we like to see. Now, do you have any… family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. I think he needed a… a special machine to help it beat. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she passed away when she was fairly young, and I think it was something with her heart too. But I don't know all the details, you see. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, some family history. That figures. And are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel fine. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just because I’ve been busy with work. I’m an aerospace engineer, you know. It keeps me on my feet! No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. That's why I was so surprised when the nurse said something was wrong.
DOCTOR: Aerospace, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I design parts for satellites. Very interesting work! It keeps the mind sharp, though, I must say. But back to the cholesterol… is it something I should be really worried about? I eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of vegetables, not too much red meat.
DOCTOR: Look, "healthy" is relative. And frankly, it doesn’t always matter. Some people just… get it. Now, let’s just get through this. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not any regularly. Just… over-the-counter things when I need them. For headaches, or if I get a cold. But nothing a doctor has prescribed. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. That’s why this is so confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything… well, as long as it’s not expired, of course! I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Standard stuff. If you’ll just have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not very good at explaining how I feel, but I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure’s a little elevated, but not drastically. Heart sounds… regular. Lungs are clear. Okay. Now, just… try to relax. It's probably nothing, but we gotta check things. We'll need to do some blood work. A full lipid panel, just to confirm those numbers. And a basic metabolic panel. Standard stuff. The nurse will get the requisition form.
PATIENT: Okay, blood work sounds… sensible. A full lipid panel, you said? Is that going to be a lot of vials? I don’t like needles, Doctor, if I’m being honest. And what exactly is a basic metabolic panel? Just so I know what we're looking for.
DOCTOR: It’s a few vials, yes. Not a huge amount. And the metabolic panel just checks your kidney function, blood sugar, electrolytes… basic stuff. Makes sure everything’s working. Look, I’ve got other patients. The nurse will explain everything. Just… get the blood work done. It’s important. We'll see what the numbers say, and then we’ll decide what, if anything, we need to do. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I mean, I’m still a bit confused about why my cholesterol would be high if I eat pretty healthy. But if you think the blood work is the best thing to do, then I trust your judgment, Doctor. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results. The nurse can explain the rest, then. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will see you now. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay… good day to you too, Doctor. Well. That was… efficient. I suppose I’ll go find the nurse.
