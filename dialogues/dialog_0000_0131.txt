DOCTOR: Well, Mykeisha Sladen, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Mykeisha Sladen. But it’s pronounced “Slay-den”, not “Sla-den”. It’s a bit of a common mistake, people get it wrong all the time.
DOCTOR: Slay-den. Right. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister kept on at me to get it checked out. She’s a worrier, that one. But, yeah, that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: “A bit high,” you say. And how high is “a bit high”, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really know numbers, to be honest. I took it at the pharmacy a couple of times, and the machine beeped red both times. The pharmacist said I should see a doctor, but he didn't say what the number was. Just that it wasn’t good.
DOCTOR: Red beeping is… not particularly helpful, Mykeisha. Do you have any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feeling sick? Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot. And I get headaches now and then, but everyone gets headaches, right? I wouldn’t say it's anything different than usual.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and headaches can be related. Have you noticed any dizziness, blurred vision, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, now that you mention it… I think I did feel a little dizzy a couple times when I stood up real quick. Not like falling-over dizzy, just… whooshy. And, come to think of it, my vision has been a bit blurry when I’m reading, but I figured it was just my eyes getting old. I need new glasses, probably.
DOCTOR: “Whooshy” and blurry vision… alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Nothing much, really. I had the flu once, when I was a kid, and broke my arm falling out of a mango tree, but that was ages ago. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat okay, even though it’s hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Family history then. Any heart problems, stroke, or high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My grandfather, on my mother's side, he had high blood pressure. Real bad. He was always complaining about it, and he ended up having a stroke, I think. And my aunt, she has it too. She’s on medication for it. So, yeah, it runs in the family, I guess.
DOCTOR: Runs in the family, yes. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, never have. I don't really drink either, maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year at a special occasion. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty straight-laced person, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get some measurements, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Cuff goes on… okay. Blood pressure is 162 over 98. Pulse is 88 and regular. Not ideal. Respiration rate is 16. Temperature is normal. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. I'd like to do a basic blood test to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and an EKG to look at your heart rhythm. That's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a lot. 162 over 98? Is that bad? Like, really bad? And an EKG… is that painful? I’m not good with needles, you know. And… what do kidneys have to do with my blood pressure? I'm just trying to understand.
DOCTOR: 162 over 98 is elevated. Significantly. And yes, it requires attention. An EKG is not painful. It’s simply a recording of your heart's electrical activity using electrodes placed on your skin. No needles involved. As for your kidneys, they play a vital role in regulating blood pressure. Problems with your kidneys can cause high blood pressure, and high blood pressure can damage your kidneys. It’s a vicious cycle. We need to rule things out. Now, do you consent to the blood test and EKG?
PATIENT: Ooh, a vicious cycle… that doesn’t sound good at all. No needles… okay, good. That's a relief. Okay, yes, alright. I consent. If it helps figure out what's going on, I'll do it. Just… tell me what to expect, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. It will take about fifteen minutes. I'll review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I'm going to start you on a low dose of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor. It will help lower your blood pressure. Do not get up quickly, and watch for any dizziness. I'll write the prescription and the nurse will explain the instructions. Any questions before I get back to my other patients?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… that’s a medication, right? Will that make me feel… different? Like sleepy or something? And… what if I do feel dizzy? Should I call you? Or the emergency room? And… if it runs in my family, will I be on this medication forever? Sorry for all the questions, I just… get worried.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril is a common blood pressure medication. Some people experience mild side effects, such as dizziness or fatigue, but these usually subside. If you do feel dizzy, sit or lie down immediately. If the dizziness is severe or doesn’t improve, then yes, you should seek immediate medical attention. As for being on it “forever,” that depends on your response to treatment and your overall health. We'll monitor your blood pressure closely and adjust your medication as needed. The nurse will give you detailed instructions. I have other patients waiting, Mykeisha. Do you have any further questions right now, or can I proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… the dizziness. Remember to tell the nurse about the dizziness. Okay. I’ll wait for the nurse then. Thank you, Dr. Batara.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly.
