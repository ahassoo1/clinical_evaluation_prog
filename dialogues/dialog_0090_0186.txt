DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a checkup for… well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I’m not too old to be running around, I guess. Just want to get this over with quickly, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: A tryout, you say. At 62. Well, alright. Though a "checkup" for a tryout is…unusual. Still. Let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me a little more about this team and what kind of physical activity the tryouts will involve?
PATIENT: It’s… a local team. Kinda like… Mongolian wrestling, but with some running involved. Not professional or anything. Just for fun, mostly. Lots of pushing and shoving, I imagine. And, yeah, running. That's the main part I’m worried about. I haven’t run much lately. Don't really know what they'll make us do exactly. It was just posted online.
DOCTOR: "Posted online." Right. And you haven't had a physical in…how long would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think… a long time. Probably… ten years? Maybe more? I don’t really go to the doctor unless something’s broken. You know, typical. Old man things.
DOCTOR: Ten years. Alright. Well, that puts us a bit behind. Before we get to running, we need to cover some ground. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions - diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been diagnosed with anything. I get a little… achy sometimes, you know, old age. But nothing a good rest doesn't fix. And I think I had the flu once, but that was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Always managed to avoid those, thankfully. Just a few bumps and bruises over the years, mostly from… well, from wrestling. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh. My parents are both… gone now. And I don’t have any siblings. Not really a family to speak of, honestly. They weren't really into sports either, so they didn’t have any health issues I ever knew about. Not much help there. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Oh, wait. I think I got a little itchy once after eating some shellfish, but it wasn’t anything major. It was a long time ago, and I figured it was just…something I ate. Haven't had it since.
DOCTOR: Shellfish. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… water, mostly. And maybe a little tea sometimes. Nothing fancy. Look, is this going to be a long process? I gotta get back to work later.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Let's move on to a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and I'll take a quick look at your joints. It won't be extensive, but it's necessary, considering your age and the fact you haven’t seen a doctor in a decade. I'll need you to step up on the scale, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Scale it is. Just… try to be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: 129 pounds. That's… quite low for your height. Okay, now if you could step over to the blood pressure cuff, please. I want to check your vitals. Relax your arm.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Relaxing. I'm always a little nervous at the doctor. Makes it hard to relax. Is that going to mess up the reading?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does affect the reading. 110 over 70. A little low, honestly. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… tell me if you hear anything bad, okay? I don't want surprises. Get it over with quick.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little slow, and your breathing is… rather shallow. No murmurs that are immediately concerning, but there's some slight wheezing in your upper lungs. Do you smoke, Mr. Kingan?
PATIENT: No! Never smoked a day in my life. What's wrong? Is that bad? What's wheezing mean? Is it… pneumonia? I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Whoa, hold on. It doesn't necessarily mean pneumonia. Wheezing simply indicates some narrowing of your airways. It could be a number of things – allergies, a previous cold, even simply your age. We need more information. Let's move on to a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… quick, okay? This is taking too long. I told you, I just need a quick checkup for this tryout!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Alright, a little weak, but within expected range for your age and weight. Now stand up, please. Let’s see you walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Ow. Okay, walking. It’s my back, it’s always a little stiff. And I haven't done much walking lately. So? Is something wrong? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this preliminary exam, and given your history, there are a few things we need to investigate further before I can clear you for strenuous physical activity. Your weight is low for your height, your blood pressure and heart rate are a bit low, your grip strength is weak, and you're reporting back stiffness. I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. Frankly, attempting this tryout in your current condition could be… risky.
PATIENT: Risky?! Look, I just want to see if I can still do it! It’s just wrestling, not running a marathon! I don't have time for a whole bunch of tests, and I definitely don't have insurance! This is ridiculous. I came here for a quick checkup, not a medical investigation! Can't you just tell me if I'm okay to go? Please?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration, but I have a responsibility to ensure your safety. Clearing you for strenuous activity without these tests would be… irresponsible. I am not going to give you a blanket "you're okay to go" based on your insistence. Given your lack of insurance, I can offer a discount on the blood work, and there may be local community programs that can assist with the cost of the X-ray. But I strongly advise against participating in this tryout until we have a clearer picture of your overall health. I'm not going to compromise my professional judgment. . I will not be proceeding with a checkup without further investigation. We can discuss payment options, or you can seek a second opinion, but I will not put your health at risk.
