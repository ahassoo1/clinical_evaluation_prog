DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… hard to explain exactly. I’m having trouble… emptying my bladder. It just… doesn't all come out at once, you know? It takes a long time and feels… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty completely emptying your bladder and a feeling of it being stuck. That can be concerning. Let’s try to get a little more information so I can understand what's going on. First, how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… It started… maybe a month ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little slower than usual. But the last week or so, it’s gotten worse. It’s getting harder to… push it all out. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s not painful, just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. Frustrating is a good way to describe it, I imagine. And no pain, that's good to know. Okay, a month ago, gradually worsening over the last week. Now, when you are able to urinate, do you feel like the stream is weak, or is it a normal strength stream?
PATIENT: It's… weaker, I think. Not like a trickle, but not as strong as it used to be. It kinda starts and stops a bit. Sometimes I have to… try a few times to get it going. It’s embarrassing to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Mr. Hilber, but it’s important information, so thank you for sharing. Okay, weaker stream, starting and stopping, and sometimes needing multiple attempts. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… like the color? Or… something else? I haven’t really been looking at it, if you don’t mind me being honest, Doctor. I just go when I need to go. I don’t usually pay attention to… details like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. Most people don't. Let's not worry about it then. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain along with this difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my belly doesn’t hurt. It just feels… empty, after I try to go. Like there's still something left in there, even when I’ve been trying for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain, just a feeling of incomplete emptying. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I don't take them anymore, though. I stopped a while ago. And… I had my prostate checked once, a long time ago. Everything was okay then, they said. I’m not sure what else. I don’t go to the doctor much, unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of controlled high blood pressure that’s now off medication, and a prostate check in the past that was normal. Good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing around. Had to have it set. And… my wife, she passed away last year, and I was in the hospital with her a lot, of course. But I haven’t been in the hospital for myself in… a long time. No surgeries, besides my arm when I was little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and time in the hospital supporting your wife. I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Hilber. That must have been very difficult. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… hard. No, I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe some aspirin now and then, if my knee bothers me. But that’s it. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just aspirin occasionally for knee pain. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. I think I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That's good. Alright, Mr. Hilber, thanks for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll do a quick digital rectal exam to check your prostate and assess bladder emptying. I'll explain everything as I go. First, let's have you lie down on your back. I'm going to listen to your belly with my stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, sounds normal so far. Now, for the rectal exam, I'm going to ask you to bend over, or lie on your side with your knees bent. It will only take a moment. Okay, I’m feeling your prostate now… It feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. I can feel some residual urine in your bladder, which explains the feeling of incomplete emptying. It doesn't feel particularly painful, but it's definitely there. Alright, Mr. Hilber. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is an enlarged prostate. It's very common as men get older. It’s causing difficulty emptying your bladder.
PATIENT: Enlarged… what was that word again, Doctor? Benign… something? I’m not good with these medical terms. And is that serious? I’m worried now.
DOCTOR: It's okay, it’s perfectly normal to be worried and not remember the terms. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH for short. "Benign" means it's not cancer, and "hyperplasia" just means the prostate gland has gotten bigger. It's very common as men age. It's usually not serious in itself, but it can cause uncomfortable symptoms like the difficulty urinating you’re experiencing. It can also sometimes lead to other problems if left untreated, like bladder infections or kidney problems. We need to do a few tests to confirm the diagnosis and see how much your prostate is enlarged and how it’s affecting your bladder. I want to order a urine test to check for infection and a PSA blood test, which can help us monitor your prostate health. We might also consider an ultrasound of your bladder later to get a better look. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Tests sound good. I’d rather know what’s going on than just worry about it. And if it's not cancer, that’s a big relief. So, what do I have to do for these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad you feel that way. For the urine test, you’ll just need to provide a sample – the nurse will give you a cup and instructions. It's best to provide a mid-stream sample, meaning you start urinating into the toilet, then collect the sample mid-way through. The PSA blood test is just a regular blood draw, like the ones you get at the lab. The results usually take a few days, typically 2-3 business days. Once we have those results, we can discuss treatment options, which could range from lifestyle changes to medication or, in some cases, a procedure. In the meantime, I recommend trying to drink plenty of fluids, but avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially before bed. Also, try to urinate when you feel the urge and avoid holding it in for too long. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I can do that. No caffeine before bed, drink more water, go when I need to go. Simple enough. So, should I make an appointment with the nurse to give the sample, and then go to the lab for the blood draw?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. I'll have the nurse come in and give you the instructions for the urine sample, and she can also give you a lab order for the PSA blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go anytime during their business hours. They don’t require an appointment. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on and having a plan. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started with the tests. Have a good day.
