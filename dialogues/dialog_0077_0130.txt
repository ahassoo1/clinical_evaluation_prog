DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Jim. Uh… well, it’s about my family, mostly. Lots of heart trouble on both sides. My mother, my brother… even my cousin. I just… want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Jim. It's very wise to be proactive, especially with a family history like that. We'll certainly do our best to assess your risk and ensure you're as healthy as can be. To start, could you tell me a little more about the heart trouble your family members experienced?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had… what they called angina, I think? Chest pain. Lots of it. She was in the hospital a few times for it. My brother… he had a heart attack. A bad one. Didn’t make it. And my cousin, he had something with his… valves? I don’t really understand all that stuff. He needed surgery. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right, angina, a heart attack, and valve issues… that does give us a good starting point. And approximately how old were your mother and brother when these events occurred?
PATIENT: My mother… she was maybe… 68, I think? Around then. And my brother… he was younger. Just 52. It was… a shock. Still is, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a brother so young is incredibly difficult. 52 is very young for a heart attack. And did either of them have any other health problems, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: My mother, she had high blood pressure, I remember that. The doctor always told her to watch her salt. And… maybe some trouble with her cholesterol? I’m not sure. My brother… he smoked a lot. And he wasn’t very good about going to the doctor. He thought he was tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, and smoking in your brother. That’s helpful to know. Now, turning to you, Jim, do you have any current health problems – high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I had my blood pressure checked at the drugstore last month. It was… normal, I think. The machine said so. But I don’t really like those machines. They always seem a little off. I don't have diabetes, no. And I don’t know about my cholesterol. Never had it checked.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good that your recent blood pressure reading was normal, although a check in the clinic is always more reliable. And we will definitely get your cholesterol checked today. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take something for my knees. They bother me when it rains. It's called… glucosamine, I think? It doesn’t always help, but I try.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and glucosamine for your knees. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s just a normal allergy, I guess. Not a medicine allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I’m retired now, used to be a salesman. Lots of driving. Now I mostly stay home, watch TV. I try to walk a little bit, when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke, never did. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. I like to cook. Is that part of lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Yes, Jim, cooking is definitely part of lifestyle! That's good to hear. It sounds like you have a fairly healthy routine overall. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and assess your current health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know if I’m okay, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Jim. We'll do our best. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and take a look in your ears and throat. Take a deep breath for me, please... and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: Okay... It's a little cold in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I apologize. We sometimes have trouble regulating the temperature in this building. I'll make a note to have maintenance look at it. Alright, just relax your arm for me. This will only take a moment. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Ears look clear. Now, let me just take a look at your throat... say "ahhh" for me.
PATIENT: Ahhh... It feels a little funny with that light in there.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be a little uncomfortable. Your throat looks clear as well. Pulse is regular and strong. Now, just to complete the exam, I’m going to listen to your heart again, focusing on any potential murmurs. I'm hearing a very slight murmur, Jim. It's quite faint, but it’s something we’ll want to investigate further. I’m going to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. And I’d also like to order a blood test to check your cholesterol levels, as we discussed. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A murmur? That doesn't sound good. But okay, if you think it’s best. An EKG and blood test… yes, do what you need to do. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s important not to jump to conclusions, Jim. A murmur can be many things, and often they are harmless. However, it's always best to investigate and rule out anything serious. The EKG and blood test will give us a clearer picture of your heart health. We’ll also repeat your blood pressure check here in the office, and I’d like you to start monitoring it at home for a week. I can provide you with a device and instructions. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. I can monitor it at home. A machine, right? Like the one at the drugstore? Okay. And the blood test… where do I go for that? And the EKG… is that painful? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, a machine similar to the one at the drugstore, but we'll provide you with one calibrated for accuracy and instructions on how to use it properly. For the blood test, you can go to the lab just across the street. I’ll give you a requisition form. As for the EKG… it's completely painless, Jim. We simply attach small stickers, called electrodes, to your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart’s electrical activity. No needles involved at all. It takes just a few minutes. We’ll get everything scheduled for you before you leave. In the meantime, let’s discuss some lifestyle adjustments that can help support your heart health. We’ll focus on diet, exercise, and stress management. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles, that's good. A little cold sticker, that's fine. And lifestyle… yes, okay. Diet, exercise… I can try. Stress… well, being retired is less stressful than being a salesman, I’ll tell you that much. What kind of diet are we talking about? Less salt? I remember my mother being told to watch her salt.
DOCTOR: Yes, less salt is a good starting point. Reducing your sodium intake is beneficial for blood pressure control. We'll also focus on incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your diet. Lean protein sources, like fish and chicken, are also good choices. It's also important to limit saturated and trans fats, as these can contribute to cholesterol buildup. The nurse will provide you with a handout outlining a heart-healthy diet. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Fruits, vegetables… less salt, less fat. Like my mother used to say. It’s just… a lot to remember. And I’m not much of a cook, to be honest. My wife did all the cooking. It's been a few years since she passed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jim. It’s a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing a partner is incredibly difficult. We can connect you with a registered dietitian who can help you create a meal plan tailored to your needs and preferences. They can also provide cooking tips and support. And there are many pre-prepared heart-healthy meals available at the grocery store if you don’t feel like cooking from scratch. For now, let’s focus on making small, gradual changes. Start by incorporating one or two extra servings of fruits or vegetables into your diet each day. And let’s schedule your EKG and blood test before you leave. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes… small changes. That I can do. Fruit with breakfast, maybe. And vegetables with dinner. And the tests… okay. I guess so. Let’s get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jim. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in to schedule your tests and provide you with the necessary paperwork and information. She’ll also go over the home blood pressure monitoring instructions with you. We’ll follow up with you in about a week to discuss your test results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Let's get the nurse in here, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jim. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
