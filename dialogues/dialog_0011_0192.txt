DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Hartness. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Hartness is fine. I’m here for... the army thing. The exam. Gotta get that done. Seems like a waste of a good afternoon, honestly. But my wife said I have to. Something about… benefits later. Don’t ask me.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Hartness. You’re here for a medical examination required for military benefits. I appreciate you clarifying that for me. To ensure I complete this thoroughly, could you tell me a little more about what specifically the examination is for?
PATIENT: Look, I just know they sent me here. Said it was a check-up. Makes sure I ain't falling apart before they let me near anything important. I didn’t ask why they need to know if my insides work, just that I gotta be here. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like this is a general medical assessment required by the military. I understand your time is valuable, and I will do my best to be efficient. To start, let's go through a brief history of your overall health. Could you tell me about any significant past medical issues you’ve had?
PATIENT: Significant? What’s ‘significant’? I broke my arm when I was ten, falling out of a tree. And I had the chickenpox, naturally. Other than that… nothin’. I've always been a strong Swede, you know? Never really been sick. Maybe a cold now and then, but who doesn’t get a cold? I work with machines all day, it’s a hard life. Builds character. Is a broken arm significant? Because that was a really bad break. Doctor said it healed funny.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Hartness. A broken arm, especially if it required significant treatment or left you with any lasting limitations, is relevant. Did the doctor mention anything about potential long-term effects from the break, or did it affect your range of motion or cause you any chronic pain?
PATIENT: Chronic pain? No. Not really. It just… clicks sometimes. When it’s cold. Or when I’ve been using a wrench all day. It’s just an old man thing, I guess. The doctor back then – old man himself – just said to “avoid heavy lifting.” Like that’s gonna happen. I assemble engines for a living! I told you, I work with machines. He probably just wanted to get me out of his office. Honestly, doctors these days… they're all the same. They see a broken bone and think it’s the end of the world. It healed, alright? I can still swing a hammer just fine. Maybe not as fine as I used to, but… fine enough. Is this important? Because I’m tellin’ ya, it’s just a click. A little pop. Annoying, but not important.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that for me, Mr. Hartness. It's helpful to understand what you experience and how it affects your daily life. We’ll certainly document this clicking and limited range of motion. Now, aside from the broken arm, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even for tonsils. My mother wanted me to get ‘em out when I was little, said I snored too loud. But I told her no. Didn’t like the idea of someone poking around in my throat. And I haven’t been back in a hospital since I was born. My wife… she had her gallbladder out a few years ago, but that’s her problem. I keep myself in good shape. I eat alright, mostly. And I work hard. That's the best medicine, you know? Just keep moving. This is a waste of time, honestly. Are we almost done? I got a lawn to mow, and it’s gettin’ hot.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Hartness, and we are making progress. Just a few more questions, then we’ll proceed with a brief physical exam. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my father, he smoked. A lot. He got… something bad in his lungs. But he wouldn’t go to the doctor until it was too late. Stubborn old man, just like me. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. Always complaining about headaches. And my sister… she’s fine. Perfectly healthy. Works in an office, doesn’t do much. That’s probably why she’s healthy. Sitting all day can’t be good for you, but… she likes it. No one else really had anything serious. Just the usual aches and pains. Old age, mostly. Is that what you’re lookin’ for? Because honestly, my family isn’t exactly known for their good health habits. Lots of stubbornness, lots of smoking… and not much exercise. Does that help? Because I’m tellin’ ya, this is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Hartness. Thank you. Now, just a few questions about your current lifestyle. Do you currently use any tobacco products, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, I told you my father smoked. I learned from his mistakes. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. A small beer. Nothing fancy. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I assemble engines for a living! I need a clear head to do my job. I don’t have time for… that nonsense. This is a perfectly respectable profession, you know. Requires focus. Precision. Not… whatever it is you’re implying. I eat a normal amount. Maybe a little too much sausage. My wife complains. But other than that, I live a clean life. As clean as it gets for a man who works with machines all day. Are we finally almost done? Because I swear, I’m gonna mow that lawn with a spoon if I have to.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Just one final section, regarding any allergies you may have to medications, food, or anything else. And then we can proceed with a brief physical exam. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Except maybe those little cocktail onions. They give me heartburn. But that’s not an allergy, that’s just… bad onions. And medications? I avoid ‘em if I can. What good are pills gonna do? I just need to work hard and keep moving. That’s all the medicine I need. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. I’m a Swede, we're built tough. No allergies. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Seriously, can we please get to the exam now? My lawn is mocking me. It's probably growing taller by the minute.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. No known allergies, that’s good to know. And you’ve been very clear about your medical history. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. I’ll just need to listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and do a quick check of your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. First, could you please remove your shirt and shoes, and I'll take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect miracles. I’m a working man, not some athlete. My blood pressure’s probably high from all the… stress. And my reflexes are probably slow from… hard work. Honestly, this is ridiculous. But alright, let’s get this over with. Just… be quick about it. And don’t poke me too hard. I need my arms for assembling engines, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm simply gathering some baseline information. Just relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That is slightly elevated. We will want to monitor that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect some mild crackles in your lower lung fields. Have you had any recent cough or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Crackles? What are crackles? Sounds bad. No cough, not really. Maybe a little bit when I’m workin’ in the dust, but that’s just… dust. I told you, I assemble engines. It’s a dirty job. And elevated blood pressure? What does that even mean? Is that bad? My wife always says I worry too much. She’s probably right. This is exactly why I don’t like doctors. Always somethin’ wrong. Just tell me if I can go back to work now, alright? I got a lawn to conquer. And it’s probably laughin’ at me.
DOCTOR: The crackles I’m hearing could be due to a number of things, Mr. Hartness, and they don’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. Given your work environment, some mild irritation from dust is certainly possible. Elevated blood pressure simply means it’s a bit higher than the ideal range. We’ll want to monitor it over time. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a simple blood test and a chest X-ray. That will help us determine the cause of the crackles and assess your overall health. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? Blood tests and X-rays? This is getting ridiculous. I came here for an army exam, not a full medical workup. Is this required? Because if it’s not, I’m not doin’ it. I don’t have time for this nonsense. My wife is gonna kill me if I’m gone all day getting poked and prodded. And honestly, I don’t even know what a “chest X-ray” is. Does it hurt? Is it gonna make me glow in the dark? Just tell me if I can pass the army exam or not. That’s all I care about. Everything else is just a waste of time.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Hartness. Based on the requirements for this specific exam, a blood test and chest X-ray are not mandatory. However, given the slightly elevated blood pressure and the crackles I detected in your lungs, it would be prudent to rule out any underlying issues before completing the assessment. Completing the exam without further investigation could lead to complications down the line. However, if you decline the tests, I can complete the basic examination required for the army form. But I strongly advise you to follow up with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. What would you like to do?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… just do the basic exam. I don’t have time for this. And don’t tell me anything else is wrong. I don’t want to hear it. Just fill out the form and let me go. My wife will probably force me to see a doctor anyway. But right now, I just want to get this over with. And then I’m mowing that lawn. You hear me? Mowing that lawn. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I understand. Here is the completed form. It indicates your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but otherwise, you meet the basic requirements for the examination. I strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss the elevated blood pressure and the crackles I detected in your lungs. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thanks. I guess. And tell your staff I don't appreciate being poked and prodded. It’s unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hartness. I understand your concerns, and I’ll be sure to pass along your feedback to the staff. Thank you for coming in today. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. .
