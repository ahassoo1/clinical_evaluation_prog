DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Smetak. Nice to meet you also. I am here because… my ear. It is… leaking something. It started a few days ago, maybe four. It is… not nice.
DOCTOR: Alright, leaking from the ear for about four days now. And you say it's not nice… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… wet. And… smells a little. Not a good smell. And sometimes… a little bit of pain. Not big pain, but… bothersome. It is from my left ear. I remember very clearly it is the left one. I noticed it after I washed my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, wet discharge with a smell, some pain in the left ear… and you noticed it after washing your face. That’s helpful to know. Has there been any hearing loss, ringing in the ear, or dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness. I am sure about that. My hearing… maybe a little quiet in that ear, but I am old. Old people ears not so good anyway. No ringing. Definitely no ringing. I have not heard any rings. It is just… quiet sometimes. Not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness or ringing, just some occasional quietness in the left ear. And the discharge… is it clear, bloody, or pus-like?
PATIENT: Pus-like, I think. It is… yellow-ish. And a little thick. Not water, but… thicker. Like… cream, but not nice cream. And it has… small bits in it. Very small. I do not know what they are. I have not looked too close. It is… unpleasant to look at. I wiped some on a tissue yesterday, but I threw it away.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellow-ish, pus-like discharge with small bits in it. That gives me a better picture. Do you have any pain inside the ear, or is it more pain around the ear itself?
PATIENT: Inside, I think. If I push on my ear… that is okay. But… deep inside, a little ache. Not all the time. Only when I move my head quickly. Or… if I chew. Chewing makes it a little worse. It is not terrible, but… I feel it. Like a… dull ache. It is the left ear, I must repeat, the left one. I remember very clearly.
DOCTOR: You've been very clear about it being the left ear, Mr. Radillo. I appreciate that. Alright, so a dull ache inside the ear with chewing or quick head movements. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any recent upper respiratory infections like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No fever. I checked this morning. Everything is normal temperature. No chills. And… no cold or flu. I had a little cough, maybe two weeks ago, but it was very small. Just a tickle in my throat. It went away quickly. It was not… important. It was not like a bad cold. More like… dust in the air. Not a sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or significant cold symptoms. Just a mild cough a couple of weeks ago. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear, if that's alright with you. We’ll need to see what’s going on in there. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or any history of ear problems?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. I will let you look. Allergies… hmm. I think I am allergic to… some red dyes in foods. Makes my skin itch. But no medicine allergies. And… no history of ear problems. Never had trouble with my ears before this. Just… this problem now. It is… new. And a little worrisome. I hope it is nothing bad.
DOCTOR: We’ll take a look and see what we’re dealing with, Mr. Radillo. It’s good to know you don’t have any medication allergies or history of ear problems. Now, I’m going to gently pull on your ear lobe and shine this light into your ear canal. It might feel a little cool. Just let me know if you feel any pain. Okay… I see some swelling in the ear canal and… yes, there is a discharge present. The eardrum itself looks a little cloudy, but I can’t get a perfect view because of the swelling. It appears you have an outer ear infection – otitis externa, we call it. It's causing the pain, swelling, and discharge. It's not uncommon, but we need to treat it.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is that bad? I do not understand. Will I become deaf? It is… worrying to hear these words. Swelling… that sounds serious. And cloudy eardrum… is that very bad? Please explain, Doctor. I like to know what is happening. And… what is the treatment? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a moment to go over everything. Otitis externa – or swimmer’s ear, as it's sometimes called – is an infection of the outer ear canal. It’s usually caused by bacteria or fungi, often from moisture getting trapped in the ear. It’s not usually a serious condition, and it’s very treatable. The swelling and cloudy eardrum are signs of the infection. The cloudiness means there's fluid buildup, but it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll become deaf. That’s why we need to treat it. The treatment is usually ear drops containing antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications. We’ll also use some drops to dry out the ear canal. It might feel a little uncomfortable when I clean the ear canal to remove some of the debris, and the drops might sting slightly at first, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll give you instructions on how to apply the drops properly, and we’ll need to follow up in a week or two to make sure it’s clearing up. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… more sense. Swimmer’s ear… I do not swim. But I wash my face every day. Maybe water gets in there. Drops… that is good. Not a big operation. And… not deafness. That is good to hear. One week follow up… that is okay. I can come back. The cleaning… will it hurt? And what about… after I use the drops? Will I still be able to hear? And… is it contagious? Can I give it to my grandchildren? They visit next month. I must make sure they are safe.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question about your grandchildren, Mr. Radillo. It’s not highly contagious, but it’s always best to be careful. Avoid letting them use your ear swabs or anything that comes into contact with your ear canal. Frequent handwashing is also a good precaution. As for the cleaning, it might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. It’s usually a quick process. We'll use a small tool to remove any debris and wax buildup that's blocking the ear canal. Regarding hearing, you might notice a slight improvement in your hearing after the cleaning and as the inflammation goes down. The drops will help reduce the swelling and allow sound to pass through more easily. If you experience any significant changes in your hearing after starting the drops, please let me know immediately. I'll write you a prescription for the ear drops and give you detailed instructions on how to apply them. It’s important to finish the entire course of medication, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared up. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… everything. You have explained very clearly. I understand about the drops and the cleaning. And about my grandchildren. I will be very careful. Thank you, Doctor Smetak. You have put my mind at ease. I will follow your instructions carefully. Perhaps… just one small question. What causes this… water getting in? Can I do something to prevent it next time? I do not want this to happen again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. That's a good question about preventing it. The ear naturally produces wax to protect it, but sometimes moisture can get trapped, creating a warm, humid environment where bacteria and fungi can grow. After washing your face, gently pat your ears dry with a clean towel. You can also use a hairdryer on a low, cool setting to help dry out the ear canal – but be very careful not to aim it directly into your ear. Another helpful tip is to avoid using cotton swabs to clean your ears, as they can push wax further into the canal and trap moisture. If you frequently swim or spend a lot of time in the water, consider using earplugs to prevent water from entering your ears. I'll write those tips down for you as well. Remember, if you notice any signs of infection again – like pain, swelling, discharge, or hearing loss – please come see me right away. We can catch it early and prevent it from becoming more serious. Now, let’s get you that prescription, and we can schedule your follow-up appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with my questions. I appreciate your kindness. The tips… I will remember. No more cotton swabs. And I will be careful with the hairdryer. I am ready for the prescription. And… the follow-up appointment. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It’s my pleasure. I'll have the nurse print out the prescription and schedule your follow-up appointment for one week from today. She'll also give you these written instructions on how to apply the ear drops and tips on preventing future infections. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re always here to help. Get well soon, Mr. Radillo.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Smetak. You have been very kind. I will remember everything. Goodbye.
