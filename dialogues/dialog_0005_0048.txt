DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… confusing, really. I keep having these moments, like I’m not quite here. My wife, she says I ask the same questions over and over. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I always knew when I got older, I wouldn’t be as sharp, but this is… different.
DOCTOR: Different how, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just forgetting where I put my glasses, you understand? It’s… like a blank spot. I’ll be in the middle of a sentence, talking about something perfectly normal, and then… poof. I don't know where I was going with it. Or I’ll be driving and suddenly not remember how I got to where I am. It's unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling. My wife says it’s been happening more often these last few months. She worries, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, memory lapses… progressive over the last few months, according to your wife. And these aren’t just typical “senior moments,” as some people call them. You're experiencing disorientation, difficulty continuing thoughts… Is it happening more frequently now than, say, six months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely more. Six months ago, it was maybe once a week, something like that. Now? It feels like… every other day. Sometimes more. And it's not just me noticing. The man at the hardware store, he knew my name and everything, but I couldn’t recall what I was buying! Tile adhesive, Doctor. I buy tile adhesive all the time. It was… humiliating. My wife had to tell me. She had to remind me what I was doing. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… I’ve been a bit more… irritable, maybe? My wife says so. I wouldn’t say I noticed it, but she points out I snap at her more easily than usual. And… well, I've been sleeping more during the day. Not sleeping sleeping, you understand. Just… dozing off in the armchair. Little naps. Nothing major, but not like I used to be. I used to be a man who got things done. Now… I feel like I need a rest after everything. Even simple things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Irritability, increased daytime sleepiness… Any changes in your appetite, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: No, appetite is… normal. I still enjoy my food. My wife makes a lovely fish amok, you know. Always has. Though… I don't taste things quite as strongly as I used to, maybe. But that could just be getting old, couldn't it? It’s hard to say. It's not like I'm not eating, just… not as much flavor as there used to be. Small things, Doctor. Small things. But they add up, don't they?
DOCTOR: Right. And, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, weakness, or numbness?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. Maybe a little tension sometimes, but nothing I'd bother a doctor about. Vision… well, I wear glasses, as you can see. My wife keeps telling me to get them checked, says they're getting old, but I see just fine for most things. Weakness, no. I can still lift a bag of cement, though I don't do it as often as I used to. Numbness? No. I feel everything just fine. Honestly, Doctor, I just feel… foggy. Like my brain isn't working properly. Not pain, not weakness, just… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay. And your past medical history, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been fine ever since. Nothing major. I broke my wrist when I was younger, working on a roof, but it healed up fine. Otherwise, I've been a pretty healthy man, to be honest. Always worked hard, always ate well, you know? That’s why this is so surprising. A man should be able to rely on his mind, shouldn’t he? Especially when he's been careful all his life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, aside from the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. A small white one, I take it every morning with my coffee. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. But that’s about it. Nothing fancy. My wife keeps a close eye on my pills, makes sure I don't forget anything. She's very organized, thankfully. I’d be lost without her, to be honest. A man gets forgetful, you know. It’s a natural thing. But this feels… different. It's more than just forgetting where I put my keys.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions now. Just to get a better idea of where we're at. It's a standard part of the evaluation process. Don't worry if you don’t get them all right. It's just to see how your memory and thinking are functioning. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, of course. I have nothing to hide, Doctor. Ask away. Though I must say, I find it a bit… insulting. As if I'm some sort of simpleton. I run a business, you know. I set tile and stone. It takes a sharp mind to do that correctly. Still, if it helps… go ahead. Just don’t expect miracles. This brain isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. It’s not about intelligence; it’s about identifying any potential issues. Alright, first question. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I should know this. It's… 2025, isn’t it? Yes, 2025. August. My wife and I were just talking about it the other day. She’s planning a small celebration for her birthday next month. So, yes, 2025. Is that correct? I hope I didn’t fumble that one. My mind feels… slow. It’s like wading through mud.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, next question. Could you tell me the name of the current president?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The president… Now, that’s a tricky one. It’s not something I think about every day, you know. I run a tile business, not a political campaign. Let me think… Isn’t it… Biden? Yes, Biden. Joe Biden. I think. Though, honestly, Doctor, politics… it’s all the same to me. A bunch of promises and headaches. Is that correct? It’s hard to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Let's try one more. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to try and repeat them back to me after I'm finished. The words are: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I can do that. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right? It's… it's like my mind is echoing. I can hear the words, but it's hard to… hold onto them. They feel slippery. Is that correct? Apple, table, penny. Please tell me I didn’t mess that up too badly. I’m starting to feel quite flustered now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you. Based on your answers and what you’ve told me, I'm concerned about possible early signs of cognitive impairment. It's too early to say definitively, but these symptoms warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also want to schedule you for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation with a neurologist. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Cognitive impairment? Doctor, are you saying… I have something wrong with my brain? I always knew my memory wasn’t what it used to be, but I thought it was just getting old! This is… unsettling, to say the least. A neurologist… Is it serious? Will I… will I lose my mind? My wife… She’ll be devastated. Yes, of course I’ll do the blood work. And the evaluation. But please, Doctor, tell me honestly… what are we looking at here? What’s the worst-case scenario? I need to know. I need to prepare.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your anxiety, and it’s good that you’re asking these questions. It’s important to remember that a diagnosis of cognitive impairment is not a quick and definitive thing. Many things can cause these symptoms, and the blood work and neurological evaluation will help us determine the cause. It could be something treatable, or it could be an early stage of a condition like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. I’m not going to speculate on the worst-case scenario, as that won't be helpful right now. We need to gather more information first. The neurologist will perform a more thorough assessment and discuss your options with you. I want you to know that we will work with you and your wife every step of the way. There are resources available to help manage these conditions and maintain your quality of life. Let’s focus on getting those tests done, and we’ll take it from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, yes. Focus on the tests. That’s what my wife always says. "One step at a time, Colt." She’s a practical woman. I suppose… I suppose there's nothing else to do but find out. And… and what about my business? What if… what if I can't run my tile business anymore? That’s my livelihood, Doctor. That’s who I am. But… yes. The tests. And the neurologist. Just… please, keep me informed. Don’t sugarcoat anything. I need to know the truth, no matter how hard it is.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. I will keep you fully informed every step of the way, and I promise to be honest with you. We can discuss contingency plans for your business once we have a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Right now, let's focus on getting the blood work ordered and scheduling the appointment with the neurologist. I have a referral form here that I'll fill out for you. It includes the contact information for Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. She specializes in cognitive disorders. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Also, I'm going to have my nurse, Sarah, go over some informational brochures with you about memory loss and available support resources before you leave. And remember, Mr. Lason, you're not alone in this. We'll face this together. Is there anyone you’d like me to include on the neurologist’s report?
PATIENT: Just my wife, Doctor. Eleanor. She… she needs to be involved. She’s the one who keeps me going. She handles everything. Eleanor Lason. L-a-s-o-n. And… and thank you, Doctor. For being honest. And for… not dismissing me as just an old man. It means more than you know. Perhaps… perhaps if you wouldn't mind, a quick explanation of what the blood work will be testing for? Just so I have an idea. It helps to know what I'm bracing for.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. The blood work is primarily to rule out any reversible causes of your cognitive symptoms. We'll be checking your levels of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and thyroid hormones, as deficiencies in these can sometimes mimic memory loss. We'll also look at your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, and do a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We'll also check for inflammation, which can sometimes contribute to cognitive decline. It's a fairly standard set of tests, and it will give us a good baseline to work with. It's unlikely to be anything dramatic, but it’s important to rule out these possibilities before we move forward with more in-depth testing. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… no, that sounds… reasonable. Sensible. It’s good to know it’s not just… jumping to conclusions. You’re right. It’s good to rule things out. Eleanor will be relieved to hear that, I think. She worries so much. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get the blood work done. And… and schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma. I suppose… it’s time to face whatever’s coming. Just… please, keep me informed. Every step of the way. As you promised.
DOCTOR: I absolutely will, Mr. Lason. That’s my promise. Sarah will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions. I'll have her schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma for you as well. I'm confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. And remember, we're here to support you and Eleanor throughout the process. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. It was good to meet you, Mr. Lason. And please, take care of yourself. We'll talk again soon.
PATIENT: .
