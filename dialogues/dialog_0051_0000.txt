DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. I just… my legs. They feel like jelly, really. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a terrible cold. Not a serious cold, you understand, just a nasty one. But now… walking is becoming a chore. It’s quite inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. It’s never embarrassing to seek medical attention, and it’s helpful to know it followed a cold. "Jelly legs," as you describe it... can you tell me a bit more about when you notice this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not constant. That’s the thing. First thing in the morning, I’m usually alright. A little stiff, maybe, but nothing unusual for my age. But after I’ve been on my feet for a while… say, if I'm doing a tour, which, as you probably know, involves a lot of walking… that's when it gets bad. And it seems to get worse as the day goes on. It’s really disruptive to my work, naturally. I had to cut a tour short yesterday.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s more pronounced with activity, and worsens throughout the day. And you mentioned you're a tour guide – that is a physically demanding job. Does it affect both legs equally, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, both legs. Equally, I’d say. It’s not like one is completely useless, but they both feel… heavy. And weak. It's hard to explain. It's not painful, exactly. Just… unreliable. It’s quite unsettling, really. You wouldn’t understand unless you’ve had it. It’s not like a muscle cramp, it’s just… gone. The strength, that is.
DOCTOR: "Unreliable" is a good way to put it. No pain, just weakness… that's important information. And it sounds like it's progressive throughout the day. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No numbness, no tingling. My balance is alright, I haven't fallen or anything. No fever, obviously, since the cold is over. I have been a little… tired, perhaps. But I always am a bit tired, honestly. I work very long hours. It could just be the job, I suppose. I’m not one to complain, you understand. But this leg business is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re able to articulate that it's different from your usual fatigue. And it's good you haven't experienced any numbness or balance issues. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I take a small pill every morning. And I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me since. Nothing else, really. I’m generally quite healthy, if you must know. I eat reasonably well, although I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. It’s important to live a little, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A little enjoyment is important. And it’s good to know your blood pressure is managed. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a small white pill. Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, probably five years now. The doctor said it was the best thing for me, and it seems to be working alright. I usually refill it at the pharmacy around the corner. They know me quite well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I’ll take Vitamin C. But that’s it, really. I don’t believe in all those fancy supplements. I find a good night's sleep is much more effective, honestly. Though, with my schedule, that’s not always easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had heart problems, though he lived to be a very old man, actually. He was a very stubborn man, you understand. He refused to slow down, even when he probably should have. Other than that… not really. A few cases of arthritis here and there, but nothing major. My family is generally quite hardy, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I do not smoke. Never have, never will. Alcohol? Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a respectable woman, you understand. I have my reputation to consider.
DOCTOR: Of course. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Just a few simple tests. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a tour scheduled for this afternoon, you understand. I’m rather busy. But yes, go ahead. I’ll cooperate. But please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t take long, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Okay, let's start with your knee reflexes. Just relax your legs… good. And now the other leg… Both reflexes seem normal. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you please push down firmly on my hand with both legs, one at a time?
PATIENT: Alright. Is that enough? It feels a bit awkward, pushing against you like this. It’s harder than it looks, you know. I do a lot of walking, but it’s not quite the same as pushing against resistance.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Both legs seem to have good strength, though I am noting some slight fatigue with prolonged resistance. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. It's a bit cold, actually. Yes, I feel that too. It’s not unpleasant, just… noticeable. Is something wrong? You’re looking rather serious.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. I’m just carefully evaluating everything. Your sensation appears normal on both legs. Alright, Sharifa, everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam, which is good. Your reflexes and sensation are intact, and your strength is present, although I did notice some fatigue with prolonged resistance. Given your history of a recent cold, and the gradual onset of weakness, and normal exam findings, it’s possible this is post-viral fatigue or a mild neuropathy. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood work.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, goodness. I do dislike needles. What exactly are you looking for? And will it take long to get the results? I have a very busy schedule, you understand. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry, but I do hope it’s nothing serious. A mild neuropathy? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles. It's a quick prick, and we'll be as gentle as possible. The blood work will help us check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and inflammation that could be contributing to your symptoms. It will also rule out any other underlying medical conditions. A mild neuropathy simply means there might be some minor nerve irritation or damage. It's often temporary, especially after a viral illness, and can be managed with simple treatments. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours. We can discuss them over the phone or schedule a follow-up appointment, whichever is more convenient for you. And just to be on the safe side, I'd also like to recommend a vitamin D supplement, as many people are deficient, and it can contribute to muscle weakness and fatigue. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A vitamin D supplement sounds… reasonable. If it won’t interfere with anything else, that is. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, you understand. And 24 to 48 hours… alright. I suppose I can manage that. Just please call me. I don’t particularly enjoy coming back to the doctor’s office if I can avoid it. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I go now? I really must get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, let me quickly check your medication list for any potential interactions with vitamin D. No interactions noted. Good. And no, that’s all for now. I'll order the blood work and have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available. We'll discuss them and determine the best course of action. You're free to go now. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or balance problems, please contact us immediately. Here's a requisition for the blood work, and a prescription for Vitamin D. Thank you for coming in today, Sharifa. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I really must get going now. Goodbye.
