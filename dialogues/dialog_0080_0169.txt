DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, well, hello Doctor. It's… my face, mostly. And my legs. They’re kinda puffy. Been that way a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why though, to be honest. Don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, "face and legs," and some puffiness. Got it. When did you first notice the puffiness in your legs, and has it been getting worse gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly? Gradual? Honestly, Doc, I don't really remember. Seems like it's just… always been a little bit like this, maybe worse some days than others. It's not like I sit around measuring 'em, you know? I just noticed it when my shoes started feeling a bit tight, I suppose. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say. Time kinda blurs, when you're… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, okay. And you said your face is affected too – can you describe what's happening there?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… full. Like it’s swollen, right? Not like a bee sting or anything, just… puffy. Especially in the mornings, I think. My wife used to point it out, but… well, she’s gone now. So I don’t really have anyone to tell me what’s what anymore. It just feels… wrong, I suppose. Hard to explain. It’s not painful, thankfully.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Puffy," especially in the mornings, and not painful. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – more or less frequent, any difficulty going, or a change in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Now you're askin' things I really don’t pay attention to. I go when I need to go, same as always. Color… uh… yellow, I guess? Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, depending on what I’ve been drinkin’. I mostly drink coffee, to be honest. Never noticed anything… different. Is this important? Seems like a lot of questions about… well, you know.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, I apologize. It helps me get a full picture. Okay, coffee mostly, normal urination. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, or have you noticed any fatigue – feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a little winded climbin’ stairs, but I’m not a young man anymore, right? And tired… well, yeah, I'm always a bit tired. But that’s just life, isn’t it? I used to be able to work all day, now I need a nap in the afternoon. Not sure that’s anything special, Doc. I'm gettin' old, that's all. It’s not like I'm runnin' marathons.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. Fatigue, and some shortness of breath with exertion, consistent with age. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Kidney issues? No, never heard of that. High blood… whatchamacallit? The wife used to take me to the doctor, she handled all that. I vaguely remember somethin' about cholesterol, maybe? And I think I had somethin' with my heart, years ago, but they fixed it. Don't remember much detail. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore things 'til they get really bad. Never been one for fussin' over my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, vague recollection of cholesterol and a heart issue in the past, but nothing currently managed. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I take a couple of aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. The wife used to have a whole cabinet full of pills, but… well, that’s all gone now. Never been one for takin' a lot of medicine. Makes me feel worse than whatever's ailin' me, usually. So, no, nothin' regular. Definitely nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat pretty much anything. Maybe a bit of gas from beans sometimes, but that's not an allergy, is it? Honestly, Doc, I'm a pretty simple man. Don't have a lot of fancy sensitivities. Never did.
DOCTOR: No, beans wouldn't be considered an allergy. Good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and face. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doc. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? Old bones, you know. And try to be quick about it, if you don't mind. I don’t like bein’ fussed over for too long.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. And I'm hearing some mild crackles in your lungs when you breathe, mostly at the bottom. Now, let's take a look at your legs and feet. Could you please point your toes and flex your ankles for me?
PATIENT: Toes… like this? What are you lookin' for, exactly? I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em. They're just… legs, Doc. A bit puffy, maybe, like I said, but I've always been a bit thick-legged. Is this serious? You're makin' me nervous now.
DOCTOR: I see some swelling, what we call edema, in both of your legs, up to about here. . That’s what I was checking for. It’s not immediately an emergency, but it's something we need to investigate. Your skin looks normal for now, but the swelling is concerning, especially with the crackles I heard in your lungs. I’m going to order some blood work and a urine test to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a urine test? Seems like a lot of fuss over a bit of puffiness, Doc. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. Just try to explain things to me clearly, alright? I don't understand all that medical jargon. And how long will it take? I got a TV dinner waitin' at home. Is this somethin' bad? Like… heart failure, or somethin'? The wife… she had somethin' with her heart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I will explain everything as clearly as possible. The blood work and urine test will help us rule out several possibilities, including heart problems, kidney issues, and other conditions that can cause swelling. It's too early to say definitively what's going on – we need the results first. Yes, heart failure is a possibility, but it's just one of many. The tests will take a few hours to process. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and you can provide a urine sample in the bathroom. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, it’s important to limit your salt intake and keep track of how much fluid you’re drinking. Would you like me to write that down for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, write it down, please. Salt and… fluid. I always liked a bit of salt on my dinner. And I drink coffee, like I said. Lots of it. This is a lot to take in. But… alright. Do what you gotta do. Just… don't go makin' me worry too much, alright Doc? I'm an old man, I can't handle too much stress. And where does the nurse draw the blood? Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: It won’t hurt much, just a quick pinch. The nurse’s station is just down the hall, on the left. She’ll have you sit in a chair and take a small sample of blood from your arm. It’ll only take a few minutes. I'll be right here, reviewing your chart, and we can discuss the results as soon as they're available. Try not to worry too much. We’re going to figure this out. And please, let me know if you feel any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness while you’re waiting for the results. It’s always better to be safe. Is there anything I can do for you right now before you go see the nurse?
PATIENT: No, I reckon not. Just… get this over with, alright? And tell me what it all means, when you get the results. Plain English, Doc. No fancy words. Alright, I’ll go see the nurse then. Thanks, I suppose. Salt and fluid… what a mess. My wife always told me to watch my salt… always…
