DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Octavis, you say? That's a nice name. Hmm... what did I come for? Now, let me think... it's something with… going to the bathroom. It's hard, you see. Real hard. Not like it used to be, that's for sure. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, thank you for sharing that. So, you're experiencing difficulty with bowel movements—harder than usual, and not as frequent as before. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Bowel... oh, you mean…pooping? Yes, that’s it! Not pooping like I used to. Used to be easy, just…go. Now I gotta… push, and it’s not much when I do go. And it hurts a little, too. Not all the time, but sometimes. I don’t even remember when it started, to be honest. A while now, I think. My husband, he notices more than I do, probably. He always says, “Zoie, you need to drink more water!”
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty passing stools, requiring straining, and smaller amounts than usual, with some associated discomfort. And it's been happening for a while now, without a clear start date. You mentioned discomfort—can you describe that pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it's not a bad pain, doctor. Not like a broken bone or anything. More like… a dull ache. Right here. Feels kinda… full, even after I go. And sometimes, when I’m trying… it feels like something’s blockin’ it. But it goes away after a bit. It’s just… inconvenient, you know? And worryin’. I don't like feelin’ like I gotta strain so much. My mama always said strainin’ wasn’t good for ya.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Stoffregen, and it's good you're listening to your body and thinking about what your mama taught you. So, a dull ache in your lower abdomen, a feeling of fullness even after a bowel movement, and a sensation of blockage when trying to go. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or changes in its color?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear… I don't think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. My husband, he handles most of that. He didn't mention anything, and he’d tell me if there was blood, I’m sure. As for the color… well, it looks like poop, doctor. Brown, I guess? Maybe a little lighter sometimes. I don’t pay much attention, if you wanna know the truth. It's just… poop.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It's good your husband is observant. Okay, and besides the difficulty with bowel movements, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… well, I get tired easier now. But I’m eighty-seven, doctor! I’m supposed to be tired. My knees ache a bit, but that’s just arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. And sometimes… sometimes my tummy feels kinda bloated. Not all the time, just… now and then. It doesn't hurt, just feels… full of air, I guess. Like I ate too much cabbage!
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some knee pain from arthritis, and occasional bloating. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? Oh, no, not really. I haven't thrown up in… goodness, I can't even remember. Maybe when I was pregnant with my son? But that was a long time ago! I get a little queasy sometimes if I eat something rich, but that passes quickly. Mostly, I just eat simple things these days. Soup, rice, fish… things that don’t upset my tummy. Oh! And I’ve been a little more thirsty lately, but I just figured that was because of the heat. It’s been so warm, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen and do a gentle palpation to get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Well… alright. I guess so. As long as it's gentle, like you said. I don't like bein’ poked and prodded too much. Old bones, you know! And… is it gonna take long? I have my soap opera on at three.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I'll be very gentle. It shouldn't take long at all—just a few minutes. I understand about your soap opera! I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. And now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Okay. I'm not feeling any obvious masses. There's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, which isn't surprising given what you've told me. Your bowel sounds are a little sluggish, but not alarmingly so.
PATIENT: Sluggish? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. Is that… bad, doctor? Should I be worried? My husband always says I worry too much. But he’s not the one with a sluggish… what was it? Bowel?
DOCTOR: It's good you're listening to your body, Ms. Stoffregen. “Sluggish” isn't necessarily bad, but it does help me understand what’s going on. It means your intestines aren’t moving quite as quickly as they should be. Given your symptoms – the difficulty with bowel movements, the feeling of fullness, and the mild tenderness – it's likely we're dealing with constipation. However, to be thorough, I'd like to order a few simple tests. A stool sample to check for any hidden blood or infection, and a basic blood test to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear… more poking and prodding? Well… if you think it's necessary, doctor. I don’t like tests, but I don't want to ignore somethin’ serious. A stool sample… that sounds messy. And blood tests… I hate needles. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick, please. And gentle! And can I still watch my soap opera?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I'll make sure everything is as quick and comfortable as possible. The stool sample collection kit is very simple—we’ll give you instructions and everything you need to collect it at home. As for the blood test, I’ll let the phlebotomist know you're a little anxious about needles, and they'll be very gentle. And yes, you can absolutely still watch your soap opera! We'll get these tests ordered and scheduled as soon as possible. I’m also going to recommend increasing your fluid intake—your husband is right about that!—and eating a diet rich in fiber—fruits, vegetables, whole grains. We can talk about some specific options that you might enjoy. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild stool softener to help things along. It’s over-the-counter strength, but it should provide some relief. Does that sound alright to you, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: More water… I always forget. And fiber… oh, my son tries to get me to eat more broccoli. I don’t like broccoli! A stool softener… well, alright. Anything to help. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t taste awful. So… water, fiber , and pills. And tests. It's a lot, doctor. But… alright. I trust you. Just… make sure I can still watch my soap opera. That's very important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. Your soap opera is a top priority! I'll make a note of that in your chart. Here’s the prescription, and these instructions will explain everything you need to know about collecting the stool sample and increasing your fiber intake. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be happy to help you with the blood test. We'll call you with the test results as soon as we have them—usually within a few days. And if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions… let me think. Well, will these pills make me… sleepy? I like to be awake for my soap opera. And… how long will it take to see a difference? I don't want to wait forever! And… is there anything I should avoid eating? Besides broccoli, of course.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Stoffregen. The stool softener shouldn't make you sleepy—it works very gently to soften the stool and doesn't typically have any significant side effects. As for how long it will take to see a difference, it usually takes a few days—24 to 72 hours—to start noticing an improvement. However, it's important to be patient and consistent with the medication and dietary changes. And as for foods to avoid, it's best to limit processed foods, fried foods, and excessive amounts of dairy. These can sometimes worsen constipation. Also, avoid carbonated beverages, as they can cause bloating. Does that help, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good about not being sleepy. I wouldn’t want to miss a thing! No processed foods… that's okay, I don’t eat much of those. Fried foods… well, sometimes I like a little fried chicken. But I can try to avoid it. And no carbonated drinks… I mostly drink water anyway. So… water, no broccoli, a little less fried chicken, and pills. And tests. It's a lot to remember, but… alright. I think I can manage. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And you promised I can still watch my soap opera, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. You can absolutely still watch your soap opera! It’s a very important part of your recovery plan, as far as I'm concerned. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, consistency is key. We’ll be in touch with your test results soon. Have a good day, Ms. Stoffregen, and enjoy your soap opera!
