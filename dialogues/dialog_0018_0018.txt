DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine, I believe. Hmm… what brings me in? Yes. Well, it’s this… frequent need to, ah… visit the restroom. It's been happening for some time now, I suppose. Not terribly bothersome, but… noticeable. I wouldn’t say it’s a problem, precisely, but my daughter suggested I get it checked. She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. It's always wise to investigate changes in bodily functions, even if they don’t feel alarming. And it’s thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in. When you say "frequent," could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Detail… hmm. It's difficult to be precise, you see. I don’t keep a log or anything. But… more often than usual, I suppose. Perhaps every couple of hours? Maybe even a little more frequently than that during the evenings. It’s… disruptive to a good night’s sleep sometimes, if I drink anything before bed. Though, I don’t drink that much, really. Just a small glass of water, perhaps. It's all rather vague, I'm afraid. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. We can work with approximations. So, approximately every couple of hours during the day, and potentially more often in the evenings, particularly if you have something to drink before bed. Now, when you go to the restroom, do you experience any difficulty starting, or any sensation of incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: Ah… good question. No, no difficulty starting, thankfully. That part is… normal, I believe. And… I don't think I have a sensation of… not emptying completely. No, that doesn't sound right. It feels… adequate, shall we say? Though, it’s been happening for so long now that I suppose I’ve just gotten used to it. It’s a little hard to tell, really. I haven’t consciously paid that much attention. Is that… helpful? I apologize if I’m being a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verbos. You are providing me with very useful information. It's quite common to not consciously focus on these details unless there's a change that prompts concern. Now, let’s talk about what you’re passing. Is it just urine, or have you noticed any blood, changes in color, or unusual odor?
PATIENT: Blood? No, definitely no blood. That I would notice, certainly. And… the color seems normal enough. Pale yellow, I suppose? As it usually is. Odor… hmm. I haven't detected anything… unusual, no. Perhaps a little stronger sometimes, but I attribute that to… well, to staying properly hydrated, perhaps? I honestly haven’t given it much thought. I apologize again for being so vague. It’s just… not something I typically dwell on, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Mr. Verbos. We are simply gathering information to understand what’s going on. No blood, normal color, and no unusual odor—that’s good. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No fever, no pain… not in my back or anywhere else, really. No… discomfort. I’m not unusually thirsty, no. Perhaps a little tired sometimes, but I attribute that to… well, to my age, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything drastically different. It’s a very subtle thing, this frequent urination. It's not like a sudden, severe illness. Just… a persistent little annoyance, if you will. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Verbos. No fever, no pain, no increased thirst—that’s helpful. You described it as a persistent little annoyance, and that’s a very reasonable way to put it. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Ah, medical history… Yes, well, let me see. High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed with that several years ago. I take medication for it, regularly. Other than that… nothing major, I believe. My doctor always says I'm remarkably healthy for my age, despite the blood pressure. No diabetes, no… prostate issues that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any surgeries, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you see. Does that cover it? I sometimes forget what my doctor tells me, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Verbos. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and no other major medical conditions or surgeries. We’ll be sure to note that. And could you tell me what medications you’re currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the medication… Let me see… I have it written down somewhere… rummages in wallet Ah, here we are. It’s… Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once daily. And… squints at the paper Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams, also once daily. I've been on these for… oh, goodness, I don't know exactly. Several years, certainly. My daughter helps me with the refills, so she probably knows better than I do. I hope I’m pronouncing those correctly! It’s difficult to remember the names.
DOCTOR: You are pronouncing those perfectly correctly, Mr. Verbos. Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide, both 20 milligrams, taken daily for your blood pressure. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I'm aware of, no. I've never had a severe reaction to anything. A little bit of a runny nose sometimes with certain pollens, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Nothing that requires any medication or special precautions. My daughter always asks me this, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I'm quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. It's another thing she worries about, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verbos. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Ah, well. I used to smoke, yes. Years ago, but I quit about twenty years ago. Thank goodness for that! I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps a couple of times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. And… no, absolutely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I lead a fairly quiet life, you see. Mostly reading and gardening. A very respectable existence, I believe. Is that helpful? I do try to be honest, you know.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Verbos. No smoking, occasional wine, and no recreational drugs. Now, before we proceed, are you experiencing any difficulty with your memory, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Ah, memory… chuckles softly As I’ve mentioned before, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I often forget things, names especially. Nothing terribly serious, but it's noticeable. My daughter keeps reminding me to write things down. And… bowel habits? No, nothing unusual there. Regular as clockwork, I suppose. Perhaps a little… slower as I’ve gotten older, but nothing alarming. No changes in color or consistency. Just the usual… aging process, I believe. Is that sufficient? I apologize if I’m rambling again. It's difficult to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Mr. Verbos. You are providing me with a complete picture. It sounds like you’re experiencing some normal age-related memory changes, and your bowel habits are regular. Now, with your permission, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and perform a gentle abdominal exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Listen to my heart and lungs, check my blood pressure… whatever you deem necessary. I'll do my best to cooperate. Just… be gentle with my old bones, if you would. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels… unusual. I'm at your service. Let's get on with it, shall we? I'm rather eager to discover what's causing all this… frequent urination.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds are regular, although I do detect a slight murmur. This isn’t necessarily concerning at your age, but we’ll make a note of it. Your lungs are clear, which is excellent. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148 over 82, and your pulse is 72, both within acceptable limits, though slightly elevated. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any tenderness. No tenderness or masses detected. Your bladder is not palpable, which is good. Alright, Mr. Verbos. That concludes the physical exam. Everything appears normal, but based on your symptoms and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out any underlying infection or kidney issues, and assess your overall kidney function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… prudent, Doctor. A urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel… Very well. If that’s what you recommend, then I wholeheartedly agree. I trust your professional judgment. I'm happy to do whatever is necessary to discover the cause of all this. When can I expect the results? And… where would I go to have these tests done? I apologize for all the questions, but I do like to be informed, you see. It's just my nature.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be informed, Mr. Verbos. It's important to be proactive about your health. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. The nurse will provide you with the necessary containers and instructions. You don't need an appointment. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once they are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine, please contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. The lab is down the hall, room 203… 24-48 hours for the results… and monitor for fever, chills, and flank pain. I've made a mental note of it all. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel… reassured, if that makes sense. Knowing that you’re looking into it is a great comfort. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… patience with my rambling. I shall head down to the lab now and get these tests done. Please, don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further information. And thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon.
