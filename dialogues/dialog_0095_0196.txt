DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t even know when it started, to be honest. A long time ago, I think. It's just… draining, you know? I just want to get to the bottom of it and be done with it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Constant tiredness can be really frustrating. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say “tiredness,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… hard to explain. Not like I haven’t slept, exactly. Sometimes I sleep fine. It’s just… everything feels like it takes so much effort. Like I'm pushing through mud all the time. Even getting out of a chair… it's a struggle, sometimes. And I just don’t have the energy to do things, you know? I used to… well, I used to do a lot more. I can’t really remember what, exactly. It’s just… gone. It’s mostly just… heavy. Is that making sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. "Heavy" is a good way to describe it. It sounds like it's significantly impacting your daily life. Do you notice any times of day when it’s worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse in the afternoons, definitely. Mornings are… okay-ish, I guess. Not good, but not terrible. Then, by the time lunch is over, I just… slump. Evenings are pretty bad too. I just want to sit and… not move. I don't really do much in the evenings anymore. I mostly just watch TV, I think. Or… something. Honestly, the days all kind of blur together, you know? It's hard to remember what I did yesterday, let alone… well. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, worse in the afternoons and evenings. And you mentioned difficulty with memory… is that recent, or has that been going on for a while as well?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… hard to say. It feels like it's gotten worse recently, but… I honestly don’t remember when it started. My daughter sometimes reminds me of things, little things I should have done. Or appointments I forgot. She's very good. But… I feel like I used to be better at remembering things. It’s just… frustrating. I'm not getting any younger, I suppose. Is that what happens when you get old? Everything just… fades?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about changes in memory, Ms. Licano. It’s not necessarily just about getting older. We’ll definitely look into that. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I had… something with my heart, years ago. A long time ago. I had to take pills for it, but I stopped, eventually. Doctor said it was okay. And… I think I had high blood pressure, once? But that was… a while back, too. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I don’t really keep track of those things. My husband… he always took care of all that. It’s been… a few years since he passed, and… things just aren't the same. I’m on Medicare now, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare is helpful to know. So, a history of a heart condition and high blood pressure in the past. Do you remember what medication you were on for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I really don’t. All those pills… they all looked the same to me. Little white ones, mostly, I think? Or maybe pink? I just… I don't remember. My husband handled all of that. He’d fill the little pill boxes every week, and I’d just… take them. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. This is all just… a mess in my head. Can we just… figure out what’s wrong with me now?
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all, Ms. Licano. We can focus on what’s going on now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything recently. I used to be allergic to… something. Pollen, maybe? I sneezed a lot in the spring. But I haven’t really noticed that lately. Honestly, I can't really remember. I'm sorry. I'm just not very good at this. It's all just… a blur. Can we move on? This is making my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem. We’ll move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Just… a little something for my arthritis, in my hands. It's a cream, mostly. I rub it on at night. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, if I’m really having trouble. Just a little thing. I think it's… melatonin, maybe? Or something like that. I get it at the drugstore. It doesn’t always work, though. Honestly, I mostly just lie awake anyway. That’s why I’m so tired all the time, I think. Is this getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cream for arthritis and melatonin occasionally for sleep. I see. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was in the hospital a lot when I was younger. And… my father… he got… confused, towards the end. He didn’t remember things. My daughter says it was dementia, but… I don't really remember what the doctor said. It was a long time ago. And… my brother… he had diabetes, I think. He had to watch his sugar. Honestly, everyone in my family seems to have something wrong with them. Is that a bad sign? It’s probably just my luck.
DOCTOR: Okay. A family history of heart disease, dementia, and diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband… he smoked a little, when he was younger, but I always made him go outside. I never touched a cigarette in my life. And… no alcohol either. Not for me. And definitely no… those things. I'm a good Romanian woman, you know? I just… don't do those things. Is that all? Can we… find out what’s wrong with me now? I really just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Alright, Ms. Licano, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, please? I'm just so tired. And… try not to poke too much, if you don't mind. My hands hurt, you know, with the arthritis. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. <listens with stethoscope> Your heart rate is a little slow, 68 beats per minute. Sounds regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let me check your blood pressure. <takes blood pressure> 130/80. That’s a little elevated, but not severely. I'll check your reflexes now. <tests reflexes in both arms and legs> Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. And finally, let’s just take a look at your hands. <examines hands> Some swelling and tenderness in the knuckles, consistent with arthritis. No other concerning findings. Everything seems to be okay, but we need to run some tests.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh… what kind of tests? I don’t like tests. Needles… and things. Are they going to hurt? I’m already so tired, and I don't know if I have the energy for… all that. What are you looking for, exactly? I just want to know what’s wrong with me, and then… can I just go home?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. We'll start with some blood work. It's a routine check to look at your complete blood count - that tells us about your red and white blood cells, and can help rule out anemia or infection. We'll also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes cause fatigue. And we'll check your vitamin D levels, as low vitamin D can also cause tiredness. We will also check your kidney and liver function, just to make sure everything is working properly. The blood draw itself is a quick pinch, and shouldn’t hurt much. We'll also do a urine test, just to rule out any infections. And finally, because of your memory concerns, I'd like to order a basic cognitive assessment. That's just a short test to see how your brain is functioning. It's not painful at all, it’s just a series of questions and tasks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. That sounds… awful. A cognitive assessment? That sounds… scary. You think my brain is… bad? I already feel so confused all the time, I don’t need a test to tell me that. I just want to know what’s wrong with my body, not my brain. But… if you think it’s necessary… I guess. I just… don't want to be poked and prodded all day. And… can I bring my daughter with me? She's good at remembering things, and… I might need her to explain what you say. This is all just… too much.
DOCTOR: I understand this is a lot, Ms. Licano, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious. The cognitive assessment isn't to say your brain is "bad", it's simply a baseline to see how things are functioning now. It’ll help us understand what’s going on and rule out any potential issues. And yes, absolutely, please bring your daughter with you. Having someone there for support is a great idea, and she can definitely help with remembering things. The tests are routine and we'll do our best to make them as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll start with the blood work and urine test. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood. After that, we can schedule the cognitive assessment for another day, when you’re feeling a bit more rested. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Okay… scheduling it for another day sounds better. I really just want to get this blood work over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can go home and… lie down. Just… tell the nurse to be gentle, please? And… can I have a glass of water afterwards? This whole thing is making me thirsty. And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Like… should I eat something? Or not eat something? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Licano. I'll let the nurse know to be very gentle. And yes, you can absolutely have a glass of water afterwards. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for the blood work. You can eat and drink as normal. In fact, it's a good idea to have something to eat beforehand, it will help with feeling faint. The nurse will explain everything to you before she starts. She’s very good and will make sure you’re comfortable. Just try to relax. I'll be right here if you need anything. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. <calls for the nurse>
PATIENT: .
