DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Trendler. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Look here, I ain't got all day. It's… well, it's this. <gestures vaguely at his stomach with a dismissive wave of his hand> It's lookin' a bit… loose. Not what it used to be, you understand. And my wife… bless her soul… she always liked a man with a firm midsection. Now it’s all… wobble. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: “Loose,” you say. A rather… imprecise description, Mr. Trendler. We’ll need to be more specific. When did you first notice this “looseness”?
PATIENT: Noticed? Goodness gracious, Doctor, I been noticin' it for… oh, maybe five, six years now? After Martha passed, I reckon. Didn't pay it much mind then, too busy, you understand. But it's gettin' worse. And I don’t like it. I used to have a proper shape, a proper build. Now… well, look at it! <pats his stomach again, this time with a sigh> It’s just… hangin'.
DOCTOR: Five or six years, gradually worsening. And you attribute this to… the loss of your wife?
PATIENT: Attribute? Is that some kinda fancy word for “caused by”? Yes! Of course it’s caused by it! Grief does things to a man, Doctor. Things you wouldn’t understand. Didn’t eat properly, lost my routine, just… let myself go. Used to be strong as an ox, pilin' those beams, you know? Now… <shakes his head> Not the same. It’s a shame, really. A real shame. And I want it fixed. Can you fix it or not?
DOCTOR: While emotional distress can certainly contribute to changes in appetite and activity levels, Mr. Trendler, attributing this solely to grief is… simplistic. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes for this abdominal change. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this “looseness”?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I ain't sick! Just… soft. No aches, no pains, no… what do you call 'em… gurgles. Just… flabby. Look, Doctor, are you a surgeon or not? Can you tighten things up or are we just gonna sit here talkin' about my feelin's? I didn't come here for a therapy session. I came here to get a stomach fixed. Are you able to do that or not? I got things to do, you know. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, a proper medical evaluation is required before considering any surgical intervention. We cannot simply “tighten things up” without understanding why this change has occurred. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you're askin' about… that? Good heavens! Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. What do you think I do, Doctor, just hold it in forever? It’s… regular enough. I ain't constipated, if that's what you're gettin' at. I eat my fiber, you know. Bran flakes and all that. Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. Are you a doctor or a… a detective? I just want to know if you can fix my stomach or not. Yes or no? Don't need all the fancy questions.
DOCTOR: “Regular enough” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Trendler. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss alongside this abdominal change?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… Now that you mention it… maybe a few pounds. Not much, you understand. But when I weighed myself last month… it was a bit lower than usual. I ain't been keepin' track religiously, though. Used to be a solid 180, but I reckon I'm closer to 170 now. Maybe even a bit less. But I ain't been starvin' myself or nothin'. Just… less appetite, I suppose. Since Martha… it's hard to enjoy a good meal like I used to. <shakes his head> Honestly, Doctor, this is gettin’ nowhere. Can you fix the stomach or not? I’m a practical man. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Let's get a physical examination done. I need to assess your abdomen, listen to your bowel sounds, and check your overall health. Then, I'll order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s standard procedure. Please lie down on the examination table. <gestures towards the table with a dismissive wave> And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Relax?! Doctor, I’m lyin’ down for a poke and prod and a blood draw, all 'cause I want a bit of wobble taken outta my midsection! It's hardly a spa treatment. <gets up slowly, wincing slightly> Fine, fine. Let’s get it over with. But don't expect me to be grateful for the indignity. <shuffles towards the examination table> And be quick about it, alright? I got a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Please undress from the waist up and put on this gown. The examination will be brief. I'll need you to lie supine with your arms at your sides. <pauses, then without making eye contact> I’ll be right back. <exits the room briefly>
PATIENT: Hmph. Brief, you say. Well, let's hope so. <begins to awkwardly remove his shirt, muttering under his breath> Undressin' in front of strangers… the indignity of it all… Still, better a bit of embarrassment than a wobbly stomach, I suppose. <pulls on the gown, which feels thin and flimsy> Just get it over with, Doctor. I haven't got all day. <lies down on the examination table, looking pointedly at the ceiling> Hurry up now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Deep breaths. <listens intently for a moment, then moves to palpate the abdomen, pressing firmly in several areas> Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? No, not particularly. Just… feels a bit soft, you know? Like pudding. <winces slightly as the doctor presses a bit harder> Ooh, that's a bit firm there, yeah. Around… here. <points vaguely to his lower abdomen> But it ain’t painful, Doctor. Just… noticeable. Like I said, everything’s just… gone soft. You wouldn't understand. A man wants a bit of definition, a bit of… firmness. Is that too much to ask? <sighs dramatically> Honestly, Doctor, this is a bit uncomfortable. Can we get this over with, please?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic to percussion throughout. No signs of ascites. <pauses, then looks up at Mr. Trendler with a dismissive expression> Your abdomen is mildly distended, and there is some subcutaneous fat present. As I suspected. <begins to document findings on the chart> No palpable masses or organomegaly. No rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normoactive. <steps back from the examination table> Alright, that’s enough for now. We’ll get those blood tests done, and then we can discuss your options. Don't get your hopes up.
PATIENT: Options? What kinda options? Surgery? Liposuction? Just tell me straight, Doctor. Can you fix it or can’t you? All this pokin’ and proddin’ and fancy words… it's gettin’ me nowhere. And don’t tell me “don’t get my hopes up.” I’m a practical man, Doctor. I want a solution. Not a lecture on subcutaneous fat. Just… tell me what can be done. And be quick about it. I got things to do, you know. A garden doesn't tend itself. <crosses his arms, looking impatient> Well?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, based on my preliminary examination, surgery is not indicated at this time. The distention is likely due to a combination of age-related changes, decreased muscle mass, and dietary factors. Liposuction is also not a viable option in your case. <pauses, then continues in a condescending tone> The best course of action is lifestyle modification: a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a focus on core strengthening. I can refer you to a nutritionist and a physical therapist, but frankly, I don't expect miracles. <begins typing rapidly into the computer again> We’ll get those blood tests ordered, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modification? Exercise? At my age?! Doctor, are you listenin' to yourself? I’m 76 years old, not some spring chicken! I’ve spent my life pilin’ beams, buildin’ things, workin’ hard. I ain’t got time for sit-ups and kale smoothies! <shakes his head in disbelief> This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. I came here for a fix, not a lecture on livin’ healthier. I want a surgeon, not a… a wellness coach! <stands up abruptly, ignoring a slight wince of pain> Forget the blood tests. Forget the nutritionist. Forget the whole thing! <starts to get dressed, fumbling with the gown> I’ve wasted enough of my time here. This has been a complete waste of my time. <pauses, looking directly at Dr. Blim with a disapproving glare> Honestly, Doctor, you should reconsider your career choice. <starts to walk towards the door> .
DOCTOR: Patient non-compliant. Unrealistic expectations. Will document refusal of recommended lifestyle modifications. <sighs heavily> Some people just don't want to hear the truth. <muttering under his breath> Honestly… a garden. <continues typing notes, ignoring the door closing behind Mr. Trendler> .
