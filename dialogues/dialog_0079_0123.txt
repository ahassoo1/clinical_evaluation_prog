DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my skin. It's been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started, oh, maybe a month or so ago, and it just hasn’t let up.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer, to be honest. Time gets away from me these days! It's all over, really – my arms, my legs, my back… even my tummy a bit. It’s not… not a rash, exactly. Just… really, really itchy. And sometimes it feels a little bumpy, but not always.
DOCTOR: All over… not a distinct rash, more of a generalized itch with occasional bumps. Is it constant, this itch, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it's worse than others. Like yesterday was bad. I couldn't sleep, I was scratching all night. But today it’s… not terrible, just annoying, you know? It's always there, though, a little bit. Even when it's not awful, I'm aware of it.
DOCTOR: Aware of it, even when mild. And does anything seem to trigger it, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but that didn’t help. I used to think it was the sun, but it itches even when I’ve been inside all day. I really don’t know. It's frustrating! I haven’t changed anything in my diet, or gotten any new soaps or lotions... I’m just stumped.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this itch?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no tiredness… not really. I guess my skin looks a little dry, but I put lotion on regularly. Oh! Sometimes it feels a little… prickly, almost like little needles, especially on my back. But that doesn’t happen all the time. Just sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Prickly sensation occasionally. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, I’m going to ask you a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you been experiencing any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. If anything, I’ve gained a little weight, haha! Old age, you know? I haven't lost any weight. I eat pretty regularly. Maybe too regularly!
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… no, everything's pretty normal there, Doctor. Nothing out of the ordinary. Sorry to be so… blunt. Is that what you were getting at? It's sometimes hard to talk about these things!
DOCTOR: It is perfectly acceptable to be direct, Ms. Cassimatis. Now, have you noticed any fatigue, or unusual tiredness lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired, of course, I’m seventy years old! But no more than usual. I still manage to get around, do my gardening, see my friends… I haven't been feeling more tired than normal, if that makes sense. I sleep alright, usually. It’s just… this itch keeps waking me up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but I haven't had that in years. No food allergies, no allergies to penicillin or anything like that. I don't take many medications, just something for my blood pressure, and that’s it.
DOCTOR: And what medication is that for your blood pressure, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every morning. I've been on it for, oh, probably five or six years now. Doctor Ramirez prescribed it. He retired last year, that was a shame. He was a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. And have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed years ago, maybe thirty years ago. And I had pneumonia once, but that was a long time ago too. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual colds and flu. Oh! I broke my wrist when I was younger, but that healed up fine. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. Well, except for this itch! That’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I need to perform a brief physical examination. I'll need you to remove your shirt and undershirt. Please lie on the examination table. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and then examine your skin more closely.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. That’s… that’s a bit sudden, isn’t it? I wasn’t expecting to… undress. Are you sure that’s necessary? It just feels a little… embarrassing. Can’t you just look at my skin first? It's mostly on my arms and back, you know. I don’t want to be rude, but I'm a little self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cassimatis, a thorough examination is necessary to properly assess your condition. I assure you, this is a professional setting, and I need to examine your entire body to rule out other potential causes for your itch. It is a standard procedure. However, if you are truly uncomfortable, we can begin with examining your arms and back, and proceed from there. But please understand, a complete assessment is preferable.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright. If you say it's necessary… I suppose I can do that. It’s just… I haven’t been undressed in front of a doctor in… well, a long time. I'll go change, then. Just… please be quick? And… maybe don't make a big deal of it?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cassimatis. I will be as efficient and professional as possible. The examination room is private, and I assure you, your modesty will be respected. Take your time. I will be just outside when you are ready.
