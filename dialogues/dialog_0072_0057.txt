DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Luft. I'm Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it. It's been… difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your record there was a recent oncology referral. “Cancer” is a rather broad term, Ms. Luft. Could you tell me specifically what type of cancer you were diagnosed with, and by whom?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I… I don’t actually know the type. Dr. Abernathy at the hospital… he just said “cancer.” He’s the one who did the tests. I just got a letter saying I needed to see someone for… more help. I’m sorry, I didn't think to ask him what kind it was. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It is… less than ideal, Ms. Luft. A diagnosis without specifics is…unhelpful, to say the least. It's crucial to know the type of cancer to determine the appropriate course of action. Do you have any paperwork from Dr. Abernathy—test results, a discharge summary, anything—that might list the specifics?
PATIENT: I… I think this is it. It’s all I got. He said they’d send more to my home doctor, but I haven't seen anything yet.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Suspicious lesion, right lung. Biopsy pending.” Pending. So, you haven't had a definitive diagnosis at all. Ms. Luft, with all due respect, this is quite concerning. We need to obtain those biopsy results immediately. Do you recall when the biopsy was performed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… it was about three weeks ago, I think. Maybe a little more. They called me a week later and said it was… something bad. That’s when Dr. Abernathy said “cancer” and told me to find someone for treatment. I’ve been… scared to push for more information. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: “Something bad” is simply not sufficient, Ms. Luft. Frankly, the lack of thoroughness on Dr. Abernathy’s part is…disappointing. We’re going to need to contact the hospital and request a copy of the full pathology report. I’ll have my nurse, Patricia, handle that immediately. In the meantime, I’d like to get a complete medical history from you. Have you experienced any symptoms – cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, weight loss, fatigue – anything at all that you’ve attributed to illness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… well, I have been coughing a lot, especially at night. And I get very tired, even after sleeping. I just thought it was… getting older. I have lost some weight, too, but I haven’t been eating much lately, because… well, with everything. And sometimes my chest… it feels tight. Not always, but sometimes. It’s worse when I try to do… anything active. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. Cough, fatigue, weight loss, and exertional chest tightness… those are certainly symptoms we need to investigate further. Have you ever smoked, Ms. Luft?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke, a long time ago, but I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. He passed away five years ago, from… something else entirely. It wasn't related to smoking.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mother, she had… problems with her stomach. They said it was ulcers, but she was always very sick. And my grandmother… on my father’s side… she died young, from something they didn't really know about back then. It was a long time ago. No one else, really. Not that I know of. We weren't very close as a family. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It provides some information. Given your symptoms and family history, and the unfortunately vague nature of your initial diagnosis, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. We will also need to repeat the biopsy, if possible, to ensure accuracy. Patricia will schedule those for you. I’m going to need you to be very honest with me regarding any other medical conditions you may have, any medications you are taking, and any allergies you may have. It’s crucial for your care. Now, let's start with your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I do get itchy sometimes if I use certain soaps, but it’s not a serious allergy. And… I think I reacted to penicillin when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. It just gave me a rash. Other than that, no. No allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills. I try to stay healthy by eating right and getting enough rest. That’s why I’m surprised about all this… the cancer, I mean. It doesn't seem possible.
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, while I appreciate your efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle, it does not preclude the possibility of illness. Now, I need to perform a brief physical exam to assess your current condition. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and palpate your lymph nodes. It’s a standard procedure. Patricia will return shortly with the necessary equipment. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. Just… will it hurt? I don’t like being touched very much. It's… a personal thing. But I understand you need to do it.
DOCTOR: It will not be painful, Ms. Luft. It is a necessary part of the examination. I assure you, I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. I will need to listen to your breathing, and feel for any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck and chest. Patricia will be right back with the stethoscope. Please simply relax, and let me know if you experience any discomfort. Do you have any further concerns that you would like to address before we begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think I’m ready. Just… hurry, if you could? Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Luft. Patricia, if you could please hand me the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me. And exhale slowly. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though there is some diminished breath sound in the right lower lobe. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs detected. Lymph nodes are non-palpable. Okay, Ms. Luft. That concludes the physical exam. It was a limited examination, due to the… sensitivity you have expressed, but it has provided some preliminary information. Based on your symptoms, family history, and the initial findings, it is imperative that we obtain those biopsy results, as I have mentioned. Patricia will schedule the chest X-ray and further blood work. I am also going to order a CT scan of your chest to get a more detailed view of your lungs and surrounding structures. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Um… yes, Doctor, I understand. It all sounds… very serious. But I trust you. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. And I’m scared. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: It is perfectly acceptable to be scared, Ms. Luft. In fact, it would be unusual if you weren't. A CT scan will provide us with a more detailed look at your lungs and hopefully clarify the nature of your condition. I will be reviewing the results personally and will discuss them with you in detail as soon as they are available. Patricia will arrange a follow-up appointment for us to review these results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for listening. And thank you for being… gentle. When should I expect to hear about the CT scan? And… will Patricia contact me?
DOCTOR: Patricia will contact you within the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the CT scan. The results typically take 24 to 72 hours to become available, after which, as I’ve said, I will review them thoroughly. I will then contact you directly to discuss the findings, and we can formulate a plan based on those results. Do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, or unexplained weight loss. I understand this is a stressful situation, Ms. Luft, but remaining proactive and informed is the best course of action. Are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Um… yes, Doctor. I’m an Occupational Therapist. I work with patients at a rehabilitation center. But… I’ve been taking some time off. For… for health reasons. I wasn’t sure if I should tell you.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Luft. Occupational Therapy can be physically demanding. Depending on the results of the CT scan, we may need to discuss the possibility of short-term or long-term disability leave. Do you have any concerns about returning to work if your condition does not improve?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. I love my job. But… I don’t want to get anyone sick. And I don't know if I have the strength to do it. It's just… everything is so uncertain. Will I… will I be able to work again?
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, it is far too early to make any definitive statements about your ability to return to work. We must first determine the extent of your condition, and then develop an appropriate treatment plan. I understand your concerns, and we will take them into consideration. It is my professional opinion, based on what we know currently, that remaining employed, while perhaps difficult, is not entirely out of the question. However, a realistic assessment will require a comprehensive evaluation. Given your occupation, and your potential exposure to vulnerable individuals, I would recommend a medical note outlining your current health status. I will prepare one for you as soon as the diagnostic process is further along. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, allergies, or medications we've not discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s everything. I just… I want to go home. Thank you for your time. And thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Luft. Patricia will escort you to the checkout desk. I expect to hear from you if your symptoms worsen. And please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns.
