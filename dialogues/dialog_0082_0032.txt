DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. I… well, my wife insisted, you see. She’s been rather insistent lately. Something about… a bit of a problem down there. Honestly, I don’t quite follow all the fuss. It’s just… a little discharge, isn’t it? Not terribly comfortable, but hardly a crisis.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little discharge. I see. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. A while, certainly. Perhaps a week? Maybe two? Time does seem to… slip away, you know. I’ve not been keeping strict accounts of it, and my wife… well, she tends to exaggerate. It’s nothing alarming, I assure you. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to keep track. So, roughly a week or two. And is there any pain associated with it, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… exactly pain. A bit of… irritation, perhaps. Especially after… well, after being intimate with my wife. It's not crippling, mind you, just a mild discomfort. She makes a bit of a fuss, naturally. A woman will be a woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, irritation, particularly after intimacy. And would you describe the discharge as having any particular color or odor, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Color… odor… Goodness, I haven’t been examining it closely, Doctor. Really! I’m a mechanic, not a… well, not a… You understand. It's… whitish, I suppose. And, yes, there is a… smell. Not a pleasant one, admittedly. A bit… fishy, perhaps? My wife mentioned it smelled like fish. She has a very sensitive nose, you see.
DOCTOR: Whitish discharge with a fishy odor. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms – any burning when you urinate, or any sores or bumps in that area?
PATIENT: Burning… no, I don't think so. Urination is… normal, as far as I can tell. And sores? Bumps? No, nothing like that. Just the… the unpleasantness, really. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve dealt with rusty bolts and broken engines, and this… this seems rather minor in comparison.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. But even minor things are worth checking out. Now, just to be thorough, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I’ve always been a fairly robust fellow, you see. I’ve never been one for doctors and hospitals. High blood pressure, perhaps. The doctor mentioned something about it a few years back, but I don’t pay much attention to such things. And no, nothing else that I can recall. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. My wife handles all the paperwork, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible high blood pressure. And you have Medicare. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… Oh! Yes, a hernia operation. Many years ago, when I was still working on the farm. Before I specialized in equipment, you see. It was…routine. Nothing to write home about. And… I think that was it. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. A few broken bones here and there, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Hernia repair, many years ago. Good. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult one. My father… he was a farmer, strong as an ox. Lived to a good age, but I don't recall any specific ailments. My mother… well, she passed away quite young, I’m afraid. I don’t believe there were any… noteworthy conditions. My wife has a rather extensive family, but I haven’t kept abreast of their medical troubles. Frankly, Doctor, I find such discussions rather morbid.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Never been one for pills. I believe in fresh air and hard work. That’s always been my remedy. Perhaps a bit of strong tea now and then, but that’s about it. My wife does try to get me to take something for my blood pressure, but I always refuse. I’m a stubborn old man, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, and then a brief examination of the area where you’re experiencing discomfort. It’s just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination…? Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle, Doctor. It’s a bit… sensitive, you see. And do try to be quick about it. I have things to do. Though, what those things are, I’ve quite forgotten.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I'll be as gentle and quick as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But I must warn you, Doctor, my bones creak a bit these days. It's not a graceful process, you see. And do try to make sure the table is sturdy. I wouldn't want to end up on the floor.
DOCTOR: Careful now, Mr. Krok. Take your time. That’s it. Alright, let's have a listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, a little bit of age-related crackling in the lungs, which is not uncommon. Now, if you could just relax, I’m going to take a look at the area you mentioned. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm observing some mild redness and a small amount of discharge. Nothing overly concerning at this stage. Any pain with this gentle palpation?
PATIENT: A little bit, Doctor. Just a slight discomfort. It's not… debilitating, mind you. But it's there. Honestly, it’s just… awkward. A man doesn't like being poked and prodded, you see. Especially in that region. My wife always makes a fuss, you know. Says I should have seen someone sooner. She’s a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No significant tenderness, but some mild discomfort as you mentioned. Given your symptoms – the discharge, the odor, the mild irritation – it’s important to rule out a few possibilities. It could be a simple infection, perhaps a form of balanitis, or something else. To be certain, I'd like to send a sample of the discharge to the lab for analysis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A sample…? You mean… collect it? Goodness, Doctor, that sounds… undignified. Is it absolutely necessary? I assure you, it’s not that serious. Couldn’t we just prescribe something? Some sort of ointment, perhaps? I’d much prefer that to… to this. My wife will be insufferable if she finds out.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Krok. It’s not the most pleasant thing, I agree. However, to prescribe the correct treatment, we really need to identify the cause of the discharge. A simple ointment may not be effective, or could even worsen the condition if it’s not the right one. The lab analysis is relatively quick and straightforward. We’ll provide you with a sterile container and instructions on how to collect the sample at home. It’s a small step that can help us get you feeling better quickly. We can also discuss a referral to a urologist if you prefer. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But please, make it as painless as possible. And provide very clear instructions. I’m not a young man anymore, and my hands aren't as steady as they used to be. And… please don’t tell my wife. She’ll be unbearable. She already thinks I neglect my health.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will provide you with very clear, detailed instructions, and we won’t mention anything to your wife without your express permission. Here's what we’ll do… Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s rather a lot to take in, isn't it? “Clean the area thoroughly…” What exactly does “thoroughly” entail? And “avoid touching the inside of the container…” It sounds rather precarious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I can manage this. I’m a mechanic, not a… specimen collector.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's break it down. When I say "thoroughly," I simply mean wash the area gently with mild soap and water, as you would normally do. And to avoid touching the inside of the container, I’ll provide you with a small funnel and a sterile wipe. Use the wipe to clean the rim of the container before collecting the sample. It’s more straightforward than it sounds. We have a nurse here who can also demonstrate the process if you’d like. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: A demonstration… yes, perhaps that would be wise. I’m not ashamed to admit I’m a bit clumsy these days. And honestly, Doctor, I’d prefer not to risk making a mess. It wouldn’t do to track anything around the house. My wife would never let me live it down. Yes, a demonstration would be most appreciated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. Let me page the nurse, and she can come in and show you the procedure. It will only take a few minutes. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. Just… get this over with as quickly as possible. And please, keep my wife in the dark. She worries too much already.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I'll make sure everything is handled discreetly. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. We'll get you all set up, and hopefully have some answers soon. Thank you for coming in today.
