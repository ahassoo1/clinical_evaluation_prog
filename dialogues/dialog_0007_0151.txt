DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this… tingling. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to know what’s causing it, if that makes sense? I need to get back to my route, you know? Lots of mail to deliver.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and I want to help figure this out. "A little while" is pretty vague though – could you tell me roughly how long this tingling has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? It started off just now and then, barely noticeable. But it’s getting more frequent, and it feels… well, like pins and needles, you know? Especially when I’m holding something, like the mail. It makes it hard to grip things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, and it’s progressively worsening. And it's triggered by gripping things?
PATIENT: Yes, gripping, holding… anything really. Even just washing dishes feels weird now. It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And it sometimes goes up my arm a little bit. Not always, but sometimes. I'm not sure if that makes a difference. I hope it's not something serious, Doctor. I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: No, that definitely makes a difference, and I understand your concern about work. So, tingling in both hands, worse with gripping, sometimes extending up your arm… Does it happen at night, or when you're resting?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit at night, sometimes. Not every night, but when I'm trying to sleep, I'll wake up with it. It's not as bad as when I'm working, but it's there. I usually just try to shake it off and go back to sleep. I thought maybe I was just sleeping on my hands wrong, but it keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you notice any weakness in your hands or arms at all?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really, no. I can still carry the mail, and I can still do everything around the house. It's just… harder to hold onto things tightly. Like, if I'm opening a jar, I need to really concentrate. I dropped a package the other day, which I haven't done in years! It scared me a little, to be honest. But I wouldn't say I'm weak, just a bit clumsy sometimes now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms – anything else going on with your health at all?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, my back has been bothering me a bit lately. Just aches, you know? From carrying the mail, I guess. I take some ibuprofen for it now and then. And I've been a little tired, but honestly, who isn't tired these days? I don't know if that's related or just… life. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, so I'm probably missing something. I don't have any other big problems, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Okay, so tingling in both hands, worsening with grip, sometimes at night, some back pain you manage with ibuprofen, and some fatigue. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. My mother had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? I try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're running around all day. And I don’t have insurance, so I don’t go to the doctor unless I really have to. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s good to know. No major medical history, no surgeries. Okay, and what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when my back hurts, like I said. And sometimes a little something for a headache, but not regularly. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. I prefer to just tough things out. Is that silly? I just don't like feeling… medicated.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all. Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and headaches, nothing else. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your arms and hands. Also, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Let's just get this over with, if you don't mind. I really do need to get back to my route. They're probably wondering where I am. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are normal, and your grip strength is a little bit weaker than expected on both sides, but not dramatically so. Your sensation is slightly diminished in your fingertips, also on both hands. And your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing some carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly with some mild ulnar neuropathy as well. The elevated blood pressure is something we should also keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Carpal… what now? Is that serious? And what’s ulnar neuropathy? I don't even know what those words mean, Doctor. Is it something I need surgery for? Because I really can't afford surgery. I just want to be able to deliver the mail. It's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. Carpal tunnel syndrome happens when a nerve in your wrist gets compressed, causing tingling, numbness, and weakness in your hands. Ulnar neuropathy is similar, but it affects a different nerve, often causing symptoms in your little finger and ring finger. It's not necessarily serious, and most people don't need surgery. Often, it can be managed with wrist splints, exercises, and avoiding activities that aggravate the symptoms. We can start with conservative treatment—splints to wear at night, some simple stretches I can show you, and monitoring your symptoms. We'll also want to address your blood pressure—lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, can make a big difference. I'd also like to get some blood work done to rule out other possible causes, like diabetes. Would you be able to get that done?
PATIENT: Splints… stretches… okay, that sounds better than surgery. I can try that. I can definitely try that. Wearing something at night doesn't sound too bad. And I can try to be more careful with how I hold things, too. Blood work… hmm. That’s… a little tricky. I don’t have insurance, you know? How much does that usually cost? I don’t want to get a huge bill I can’t pay. I really appreciate you trying to help, Doctor, but I'm worried about the money. I just don't know if I can afford all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, and you're right to ask. The cost of blood work can vary a lot depending on the lab. Let me see if I can find a lab that offers a discount for uninsured patients. There are also some community clinics that offer reduced-cost testing. There’s a lab just a few blocks from here that offers a basic panel for around $75, and I can write you a prescription for only the tests we absolutely need to start with. We can also discuss payment plans if needed. In the meantime, let me show you how to do some simple wrist stretches and exercises. These stretches can help relieve some of the pressure on the nerves in your wrists. Try to do them a few times a day, especially before and after delivering the mail. We can reassess in a couple of weeks after the bloodwork and see how you’re doing. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: $75… okay, that's… doable, I think. I can probably manage that. And showing me the stretches is great. I’d rather try that first anyway. I don't want to spend money on tests if I don't have to. So, stretches, $75 for the blood work, and then come back in two weeks? That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I really hope this works. I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I'm glad I could help. Here's a printout with instructions for the stretches, and a requisition for the blood work. Please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. I'm optimistic that we can get this under control.
