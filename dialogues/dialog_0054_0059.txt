DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here because… my speech. It’s been a bit… off, lately. Slurred, I think my husband said. I don’t entirely recall when it started, to be honest. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, "a bit off" and slurred speech. That's a good starting point. And you said you're not entirely sure when it started, just gradually noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Gradually. It wasn’t a sudden thing. I just… woke up one day and realized I wasn’t speaking as clearly as I usually do, I suppose. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific date. My memory isn’t what it used to be, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful that you noticed it was gradual. And it's alright if you don't have a precise date. Can you describe when you notice it the most?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I think it’s more noticeable when I’m… tired. Or stressed, perhaps. When I’m talking quickly, it seems to get worse. But honestly, sometimes I don’t even realize it’s happening until someone points it out. My husband, mostly. He's very observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be exacerbated by fatigue and stress, and when you speak quickly. And your husband has been noticing it, which is helpful. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the speech changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No, not that I'm aware of. No headaches, no dizziness. My hands don't shake, and I haven't had any trouble walking or seeing. Just… the speech, really. I do feel a bit more tired than usual, now that you mention it, but I thought that was just from work. It’s quite demanding, you know. Construction management is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches, dizziness, tremors, or vision changes. Just the speech and some increased fatigue. And you work in construction management, which is physically and mentally demanding. Do you have any history of medical problems, Adyn?
PATIENT: Medical problems… That’s a bit tricky. I’ve… always been fairly healthy, thankfully. Nothing major, at least not that I recall. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that. As an adult… I think I had a bout of the flu a few years back. Oh, and I had my wisdom teeth removed, but that was ages ago. I’m married, and my husband handles most of the medical paperwork, so I don’t always know the specifics. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy with typical childhood illnesses, a bout of the flu, and wisdom teeth removal. And you’re covered by Medicare. Any surgeries beyond the wisdom teeth removal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t think so. I’m quite certain there hasn’t been anything else. Nothing that I remember, anyway. Like I said, my husband is very good with keeping track of these things. I tend to… forget details. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it alright if he comes to the next appointment? He’d probably be able to tell you more.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it’s perfectly alright – and probably very helpful – if your husband joins us for the next appointment. Don't worry about remembering all the details, that's what we're here for. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, but I don’t know what exactly. It was a long time ago. My father was always very healthy, as far as I know. He passed away a few years back, naturally. And that’s about all I can recall, unfortunately. It wasn’t something we talked about much, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother and some heart condition in your grandfather. And your father was generally healthy. Now, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, I’m married, as I mentioned. I’ve been with my husband, Mark, for ten years now. We don’t have any children. I work full-time as a construction manager, so my days are quite busy. I don’t really have much time for hobbies, sadly. I used to enjoy gardening, but… that was before work took over. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Mostly just a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I live a pretty quiet life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, married to Mark for ten years, no children, full-time construction manager, no smoking, occasional alcohol consumption, and generally a quiet life. One last question regarding your history - do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. No food allergies, no environmental allergies. I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that. I don’t wear any jewelry, so I’ve never had a reaction to metals either. I really don’t think I have any allergies. Is that alright? Or is there something specific I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine. No known allergies is good to know. Alright, Adyn, thank you for that comprehensive history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a quick neurological exam to assess your speech and coordination. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. I trust your judgement, and I’m hoping you can figure out what’s going on. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up here for me, please. I’m going to start by taking your blood pressure. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves and assess your speech a little more closely. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? It’s a little difficult, but I’m trying my best. I hope I’m not making it harder for you. It's just… sometimes my coordination isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Adyn. You're doing great. Good, good. Now, could you smile for me?
PATIENT: Is that alright? I sometimes feel a bit self-conscious during these things, but I'm trying my best. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, just checking for facial symmetry. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you to say a few simple phrases. Could you say "Hello, hello"?
PATIENT: Hello, hello. Is that… okay? It feels a bit strange saying it over and over like this, but I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just hope it doesn’t sound too slurred. It’s hard to tell sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now could you say “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers”?
PATIENT: Pee-ter… Pi-per… picked… a peck… of pick-led pep-pers. Oh dear. That didn't come out very well, did it? I apologize. It's much harder than it looks.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Adyn. It's helpful to hear. And now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Is that alright? I hope I’m not squeezing too hard, or not hard enough. It’s difficult to gauge sometimes. I’m trying my best to cooperate. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? It’s unsettling feeling like something is off.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Is that alright? I hope I don’t stumble. My balance hasn’t been the best lately, but I’m trying to be careful. I just want to make sure I don’t fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, thank you. You can sit back down now. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, the speech changes and slight unsteadiness are concerning. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to a neurological issue, such as a transient ischemic attack – sometimes called a mini-stroke – or a more chronic condition affecting the nervous system. Fatigue and stress can sometimes contribute to these symptoms, but we need to rule out more serious causes first. Do you have any history of headaches, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: A mini-stroke… oh dear. No, no headaches. No vision changes that I'm aware of. And no weakness… not that I've noticed. I mean, sometimes my hands feel a bit clumsy, but I just assumed that was from work. Construction management is very physically demanding, you know? It's… a lot of lifting and reaching and… It's all a bit blurry, honestly. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it something serious? Will I be alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you haven't experienced any weakness or vision changes. Given your symptoms and the possibility of a neurological cause, I would like to order some tests. Specifically, I want to get an MRI of your brain to get a better look at the structures and rule out any stroke or other abnormalities. I also want to get a blood test to check for any underlying inflammation or other medical conditions. I'm going to be upfront with you, Adyn. While it's possible this could be something less serious, it's important to rule out the more concerning possibilities first. The MRI and blood tests will help us do that. I also want to consult with a neurologist to get their expert opinion. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist… Yes, yes, that sounds… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just… I’m a bit scared, to be honest. But I understand that we need to figure out what’s going on. So yes, please. An MRI and a neurologist. Whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. Will the MRI be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question. The MRI itself isn't painful, but it does require you to lie very still inside a large machine. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, but we can give you medication to help with that if you're concerned. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, it depends on how busy the radiology department is, but I would expect to have them back within 2-3 business days. I’ll call you as soon as I have them and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. If you experience any new symptoms – such as sudden weakness, vision changes, severe headache, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you manage any stress or worry while we wait for the results. It’s not meant to solve the problem, but it can help you feel a bit more comfortable. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A few questions, yes. Will this anti-anxiety medication interfere with any work I do? I need to be alert on the construction site. And… what if it is something serious? What are the treatment options? I know it’s a lot to ask, but I just… I need to know what I’m facing. And… would my husband be able to come with me to the MRI? I get a bit nervous in medical settings.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Adyn. Let’s address them one by one. The anti-anxiety medication is a low dose and shouldn't significantly impair your alertness, but it can cause some drowsiness, especially initially. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you feel it’s affecting your work, we can adjust or discontinue it. Safety is the priority, and we wouldn't want anything to compromise your ability to work safely. As for what if it is something serious… that depends on the diagnosis. If it’s a stroke, for example, treatment options include medication to dissolve the clot, rehabilitation therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Other neurological conditions have different treatment options, but we’ll discuss those in detail once we have a diagnosis. The good news is that many neurological conditions are treatable, and early intervention is key. And yes, absolutely, your husband can come with you to the MRI. Having a support person there can be very helpful, especially if you’re feeling anxious. Please bring his ID with you for security purposes. I’m going to print out a referral for the MRI and a prescription for the anti-anxiety medication. I’ll also give you a list of resources for neurological conditions. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It's still a bit scary, but I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and I’ll be sure to bring Mark with me. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. I look forward to discussing the results with you. Don't hesitate to go to the emergency room if any new symptoms develop. .
PATIENT: Thank you again for everything. .
