DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor… Mutnick, right? Good. Good. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Needed to find a doctor. Something about… the healthcare. Medicare, you know? It’s all very… confusing. I don’t really have anything wrong, not really. Just… checking in. Is that how it works?
DOCTOR: “Checking in” is… not typically how medical appointments function, Mr. Szmyd. While preventative care is important, there usually is a specific reason for a visit. Still. Since you’ve recently relocated and are establishing care, we can proceed with a basic assessment. To be efficient, let’s focus on any current symptoms you are experiencing, even if you deem them minor. Are you having any pain, discomfort, or changes in your body function?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well… my hands. They shake a little. Always have, a bit. But maybe… more now? It makes… applying makeup difficult. You know, for the… work. Not a big deal, really. It's just… annoying. And I get tired. Very tired. But everyone gets tired, yes? I don’t know. Is that a symptom? What is a symptom?
DOCTOR: "Symptoms," Mr. Szmyd, are indicators something is deviating from your normal state of health. Tremors and fatigue can be indicators, yes, but they are exceedingly common and have a multitude of causes. To properly assess this, I need more detail. When did you first notice the increased tremor?
PATIENT: Increased? Oh… it’s hard to say. Years, maybe? A long time. I’ve always been… a bit shaky. But, uh… maybe a few months ago it felt… worse? I don't know exactly. I work a lot. Long hours. Maybe it’s just… the work. It's stressful, you know? All the… faces. And the… people. Very demanding. Does that make sense? I don't keep track of dates. Never have.
DOCTOR: Demanding work can certainly contribute to fatigue. However, we cannot simply attribute these symptoms to stress without further investigation. And, frankly, a vague timeline is… unhelpful. Do the tremors occur constantly, or are they intermittent?
PATIENT: Inter… what? Oh! Sometimes. Not… all the time. When I’m working, mostly. Especially when I have to be very… precise. Like, doing the… eyes. Very delicate. Then they shake bad. When I’m resting… not so much. But I always feel… a little shaky, inside. Like a… hummingbird. Is that… normal? I don’t know what is normal anymore. Everything feels… different now. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Old age” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Szmyd. We need specifics. Do you experience any other symptoms associated with the tremors – rigidity, slowness of movement, balance issues?
PATIENT: Rigid… what now? Balance? No… I don't fall. Not usually. A little wobbly sometimes, maybe, but… everyone is wobbly when they get up fast, yes? I… I feel… cold. Always cold. Even in the summer. And my… face. It feels… stiff. Like I can’t… smile properly. See? It’s not very good. Not like it used to be. It makes the work… difficult. People want… happy faces.
DOCTOR: Stiffness, cold sensitivity, and changes in facial expression are… concerning. Now, let’s review your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm. Well… I had the… flu, a few times. And… something with my… stomach, years ago. The doctors gave me pills. But I don’t remember exactly what it was. And my… ex-wife… she said I snore. Very loudly. Is that a medical condition? I don't really go to doctors. Never have. They just tell you to stop… something. Stop smoking, stop drinking… I don’t do those things anyway. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. No significant medical history. Past surgical history?
PATIENT: Surgical… oh! My teeth. I had some teeth… pulled. A long time ago. And… a mole removed. From my… back. But that was… ages ago. I don’t even remember the doctors' names. They… cut it off. That's all I know. It didn't hurt much. Mostly just… uncomfortable. Is that important? I thought you were asking about something… serious. Like… heart things. Or… brain things. I don’t have any of those. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Very well. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a… difficult question. My mother… she… was always cold. Very, very cold. Even in the summer. And my father… he… he drank. A lot. Is that… history? They are both… gone now. A long time ago. I don’t really… talk about them. Not much. It’s… sad. And I don’t know… medical things. They just… died. Old age, probably. Like me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, your responses are… unhelpful. However, I can proceed with a basic neurological exam to assess your tremors and rigidity. Please extend your arms in front of you. I will be observing for any involuntary movements.
PATIENT: Involunt… oh. Okay. Arms… like this? It's always worse when I try to be… still. It’s very annoying. It makes me look… weak. Are you… judging me, Doctor? I need strong hands for the work, you know. Very precise work.
DOCTOR: Now, I’d like you to gently tap your fingers to your thumb, rhythmically. Let me observe your hand movements.
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult. They don’t… listen anymore. Used to be so… smooth. Very precise. I need precise hands for the… work. It's very frustrating, Doctor. Very frustrating. Is it… something serious? Are you going to give me pills?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… diminished, and there is noted rigidity in your upper extremities. I'm concerned about the possibility of a neurological condition. I need to order some blood work and an MRI of the brain to further investigate.
PATIENT: MRI…? Blood work…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Very serious. Will it… hurt? I don’t like needles. And those machines… they’re very loud, aren’t they? And what if you… find something? What if it’s… bad? I need my hands for the work, Doctor. I need them. What am I going to do…?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, please. While these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms, they are not inherently dangerous. The blood work is a simple procedure. The MRI is non-invasive, though it does require you to lie still for a period of time. As for “finding something,” that is precisely the purpose of these tests – to identify any underlying issues. The sooner we have a diagnosis, the sooner we can discuss appropriate treatment options. I will write you a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. I would like you to schedule these tests as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Neurologist…? More doctors…? This is… very complicated. Very stressful. I just wanted to find a doctor, you know? To make sure everything was… okay. Not… tests and neurologists and… everything. Okay. I’ll… schedule the tests. But what if it’s bad? What if I can’t… work anymore? This is… terrible. Just terrible. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, it is too early to speculate about any specific outcome. We must gather more information before drawing any conclusions. I understand your concerns, but dwelling on worst-case scenarios will only exacerbate your anxiety. Schedule the tests, and we will discuss the results when they are available. I wish you the best. Next patient. .
