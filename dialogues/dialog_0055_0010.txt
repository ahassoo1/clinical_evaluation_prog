DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain, actually. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I wanted to get it checked out. I don't quite recall when it started, to be honest. It just… appeared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Appeared, you say. Vague recollections are… not particularly helpful, Mr. Tomassoni. But we’ll endeavor to ascertain the relevant details. Could you describe where this swelling is located?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… mostly on my face, I believe. Around my jawline, and… perhaps a little on my forehead? It’s not terribly painful, more… noticeable, I suppose. It feels… soft, if that makes sense. And it seems to be worse in the mornings. Though, again, I’m not entirely certain. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: "Worse in the mornings," you say. Interesting. And how long would you estimate this has been occurring?
PATIENT: That's… a very good question. Honestly, Doctor, it's quite difficult. Perhaps a week? Maybe two? It’s hard to pinpoint. Everything feels a bit… blurry, if I'm being truthful. It didn't seem sudden, but I couldn’t say precisely when it began. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: It is… less than ideal, Mr. Tomassoni. But we shall proceed. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not that I recall. No pain, no fever… I haven’t noticed any changes in my appetite. I think I’ve been sleeping alright. Oh, actually… I’ve felt a little more tired than usual, perhaps? But that could just be the heat, surely. It’s been quite warm lately. I truly can't say with any certainty, Doctor. My mind feels… cloudy.
DOCTOR: According to your records, you’ve had no recent significant illnesses or hospitalizations. No allergies listed. Are these records up to date, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe so. I haven’t been to the hospital in… well, I can’t recall exactly, but it’s been a very long time. And no, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite… robust, actually. Until recently, of course. It’s just… disconcerting to feel this unwell without knowing why.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you’ll permit. Primarily focusing on your head and neck. It will allow me to assess the swelling you’ve described and rule out any obvious causes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’ll do as you say. Please, let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m going to feel around your neck and jaw. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. The lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged bilaterally. Not acutely inflamed, but notable. Now, I’ll examine your thyroid. Please extend your neck slightly.
PATIENT: It’s… a little sensitive, yes. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. Like this? Is that alright? I'm not sure I’m doing it correctly. And… no, I don’t feel any particular discomfort there. Just… a general feeling of… fuzziness, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so vague. It’s quite frustrating, not being able to articulate things properly.
DOCTOR: “Fuzziness,” you say. I understand your frustration, Mr. Tomassoni. It is… unhelpful when patients struggle to convey their symptoms precisely. The thyroid feels… normal to palpation. No nodules or masses detected. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Breathing is clear bilaterally. Heart rate and rhythm are regular. Now, I'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: That's… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Alright, please, go ahead. I haven’t had any issues with my reflexes that I’m aware of, but… well, I haven’t been paying particularly close attention, to be honest. It’s… difficult to remember things these days. I do feel a little… lightheaded, perhaps? But that could just be the examination room.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… normal. No deficits detected. Overall, the physical examination is… unremarkable, aside from the mild lymph node enlargement. However, your reported fatigue and lightheadedness warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid function panel. That will help us determine if there’s an underlying infection, anemia, or thyroid abnormality. Also, given the swelling, and the vague nature of your symptoms, I think a CT scan of your head and neck would be prudent.
PATIENT: A CT scan… That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. But I understand. If that’s what’s necessary to find out what’s happening, then I suppose it’s best. A complete blood count and a thyroid panel, as well… alright. Will these tests require me to come back another day? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it isn’t too long. I’m… rather anxious about all of this.
DOCTOR: Naturally, Mr. Tomassoni. The blood work can be done today, and the results should be available within 24-48 hours. The CT scan will require a separate appointment, which we can schedule for tomorrow morning. It's a relatively quick procedure, but it does involve exposure to a small amount of radiation. As for your anxiety… it's understandable. However, it's crucial to remain calm and allow us to conduct a thorough evaluation. The tests will provide valuable information, and we can proceed accordingly. I will have the receptionist schedule the CT scan for you and provide you with the necessary instructions. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and ensuring adequate hydration.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As you say. Avoiding strenuous activity… and staying hydrated. I can manage that. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And… for your patience. I realize I’m not the easiest patient. I’ll… wait for the receptionist, then. And I'll try to remain calm, as you suggested. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this soon. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling the CT scan and provide any further instructions. I trust you’ll follow those carefully. .
