DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well... I think it's about this... tryout. For the team. Baseball. Or… something with a ball. It’s a physical, right? They told me I needed a check-up before I could… well, try out. It’s been a long time since I had one of these. I don't really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok, a pre-participation physical for a baseball team – that’s perfectly reasonable. It’s good you're getting it checked out. “A long time” is a bit vague though – can you recall roughly when you last saw a doctor, even for something minor?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. Let me think. Doctor… a long time ago. Maybe when my wife… well, never mind that. Before the divorce, definitely. Perhaps… ten years? Fifteen? It was for the… the back. Something with lifting things. At the job. Yes, lifting. I don’t recall the doctor’s name. It was a different place. This is… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, fifteen years is a good starting point. We'll need to gather some updated information then. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the specifics – we're here to figure things out. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Current health… well, I get around. I still do some work, you know? Construction. Mostly light things now. Not like before. My knees bother me sometimes, when it’s cold. And my back. Still the back, really. It aches. Nothing I can't work through, mostly. I don’t get sick often. I think. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I eat… regular food. I guess. Not fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Knees and back pain, mostly when it's cold, and generally good health otherwise. "Regular food" is fine – no specific dietary restrictions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, no restrictions. I like… meat. And potatoes. Things my mother made. Not too much of that fancy salad stuff. Just… normal food. I drink coffee, every morning. Helps me get going. Sometimes a beer with the guys. Nothing… crazy. You know? Just… a normal life. Or, what used to be normal.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked a day in my life. My father, he smoked. Terrible habit. Smelled awful. No, I don’t smoke. I avoid people who smoke, if I can. It's bad for you. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I take something for the… the pain. In my knees. Ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. Sometimes. When it really bothers me. And… that's about it. I used to take something for… acid reflux? But I stopped. Didn’t seem to do much good. No vitamins. Never been much for those fancy things. Just the ibuprofen, when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you recall the dosage, and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Dosage… hmm. That’s a tricky one. Two pills? Maybe? I just take what the… the bottle says. When it hurts. Not every day, certainly. Maybe two or three times a week when it’s cold, or I’ve been doing a lot of work. I honestly can’t remember the exact number. It's on the bottle, though. I usually just… take enough to get through it. I don’t like taking pills if I don't need to.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll take a look at the bottle later to confirm. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My mother made sure I tried everything when I was little. No hives, no itching, no trouble breathing. Nothing. I think I’m pretty clear. Though… I don’t like shellfish. But that’s just a preference, not an allergy. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Now, let’s get a bit into your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm. Chronic… Let me think. The doctor… years ago, said my pressure was a little high. He said to watch my salt intake. That was… before the divorce, I think. He didn’t put me on any medicine. Just said to… be careful. I don’t think I have… diabetes. Never been told that. Asthma? No. Never had trouble breathing. Just… regular aches and pains, you know? Old man stuff. That’s about it. Nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but no formal diagnosis or treatment. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Yes, once. When I was a boy, I broke my arm. Fell out of a tree. Nothing serious, just a cast for a few weeks. Surgeries… No. Never had surgery. I avoid those if I can. Too much poking and prodding. No, I've never been under the knife. Just the broken arm when I was a kid. That's it. A simple break. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, no other hospitalizations or surgeries. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had problems with her heart, near the end. She was older, though. My father… he smoked, as I said. He got sick. Lung problems. My brother… he’s got some kind of… arthritis? Bad joints. That’s about all I can remember. My family wasn’t big on talking about those things. It was… uncomfortable. So, I don’t know much. Heart trouble, lung problems, arthritis… that’s about it. Nothing else really comes to mind. It wasn't a healthy bunch, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives us something to work with. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, the construction is exercise, right? Lifting, bending, walking around. It keeps me moving. But regular… like going to a gym? No, I don't do that. Not for a long time. I used to play baseball when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Now, it’s mostly just… work. That's my exercise. Gets me tired, at least. It's not fancy, but it keeps me going. I’m not sitting around doing nothing, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you currently use tobacco products, or have you ever been exposed to significant alcohol use?
PATIENT: Tobacco? No. Absolutely not. As I said, my father smoked, terrible habit. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I have a beer sometimes, with the guys. On a weekend. Nothing crazy, just a couple of beers. I don't drink every day. Never been a heavy drinker. Just… social drinking. Keeps me relaxed. Nothing to worry about there. I’m a normal guy, I promise. Just a couple of beers now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok, thank you for that thorough history. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we'll take a look at your knees and back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Heart, lungs… knees, back. Yes. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt. My back sometimes… it doesn’t like being poked and prodded. But do what you need to do. I trust you. Let’s get it over with. The sooner we do this, the sooner I can… try out for the team. Yes. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 86. That's something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we'll want to note it. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your ears look normal, no signs of infection. Your nose and throat are clear as well. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Elevated blood pressure, you say? A murmur? Yes. I get nervous at the doctor. That’s probably it. I told you I don’t like this poking and prodding. Yes. Knees, you say? There we go. A little stiff. That’s the cold, mostly. They ache in the winter. Not terrible, just… old man stuff. You can feel the… the roughness. Old injury, maybe? I don’t really remember. It's been years. Just… bendy and achy. Yes. Is that what you want? Bendy and achy?
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel some crepitus – that’s the grinding sound you hear – and tenderness on the inside of both knees. That's consistent with some mild arthritis. Can you straighten them all the way?
PATIENT: Straighten them… Yes. There we go. A little… pop. Yes. Sometimes they pop. It’s been years, like I said. Never really bothered me much. It's just… old. The knees, I mean. Everything is just… old. Pop. Yes. Is that what you wanted? The pop? It's not painful, really. Just… a pop. A normal pop, I think. Yes. Everything is getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now let’s check your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: Comfortable… hmm. Not really, but… alright. Oh. That’s… that’s enough. Yes. It hurts. That’s the back. The lumbar spine, you said? It aches. It always aches. Especially when it's cold. Or when I’ve been lifting things. It's old. Like everything else. Just… stop there. That’s enough bending for today. Yes. Don’t push it. It’s… delicate.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to push it. And you’re right, it’s definitely tender in your lower back. I'm going to document this as mild lumbar tenderness. Okay, Mr. Bartok, based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, here’s what we’ve got. You have a history of elevated blood pressure, a slight heart murmur, and some mild arthritis in both knees, and some tenderness in your lower back. You have no reported allergies, and you take ibuprofen as needed for pain. Given your age and the fact that you are trying out for a baseball team, I’d like to order a few tests just to get a more complete picture. Specifically, I’d like to get a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and some X-rays of your knees and lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Yes. I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. A complete… what was it? Blood count? Electrolytes? EKG? X-rays? Yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will tell you something, then do it. Just… try not to poke and prod too much. And… how long will it take? I have things to do, you know. I need to know if I can… try out for the team. This is important to me. So, yes. Do the tests. Just… quickly, please. And… can you tell me when I’ll get the results? I need to know if I'm… okay to play. Yes. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. I understand your concerns and I’ll get these ordered right away. The lab work will take a few days to process, and we can usually get the X-ray results back within 24-48 hours. Once I have all the results, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I would advise you to continue taking ibuprofen as needed for pain, but avoid any strenuous activity until we’ve had a chance to review the results. I’m also going to have my nurse draw up a work note for you, in case your job requires any restrictions. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A work note? Yes, that would be good. My boss… he doesn't understand. He wants me to… lift things. That’s what I do. Yes. A work note would be helpful. And… will these tests tell me if I can play? If my knees and back are strong enough? That’s what I really want to know. Can I play? That’s the question. Yes. And… will it be expensive? These tests? I'm on Medicare, you know. Yes. Expensive? And… can I play? Those are my questions. Yes. Expensive and… can I play?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s address your concerns one at a time. Yes, I’ve included a work note in the order. It will state your current condition and recommend avoiding strenuous lifting until we have the test results. Regarding the tests, they will help us assess the health of your knees and back, and determine if there are any underlying issues that could prevent you from playing. They won’t give us a definitive “yes” or “no” right away, but they will give us a much clearer picture. And yes, I understand your concern about the cost. All of these tests should be covered by Medicare, but it’s always best to double-check with your insurance provider to be certain. My nurse will be happy to assist you with that if you'd like. Ultimately, my goal is to ensure your safety and help you determine if you can participate in baseball without risking injury. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible, and I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… call me quickly, Doctor. I want to know. Quickly. And… make sure my nurse helps me with the money. Medicare… it's complicated. Yes. Quickly and… money. That's all. Just… quickly and money. I hope I can play. That's what I want. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Quickly and… money.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. I understand your eagerness, and I assure you, I’ll get these results to you as soon as possible. And my nurse will definitely assist you with the Medicare coverage. We’ll get everything taken care of. Have a good day, Mr. Bartok. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Quickly… and… money. Yes. Baseball… hopefully. Thank you.
