DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes. Look, I haven’t much time for this, frankly. It’s… the college. The students. It’s all rather… taxing. A dreadful waste of a perfectly good mind, dealing with… them. It’s stressful, if you must know. Though I doubt you haven’t heard this before. Young people these days… no respect for knowledge.
DOCTOR: Right. Stressful. And you’re a… professor, I presume?
PATIENT: “Professor” is… a generous term. I teach Library Science. Postsecondary. At the… well, it doesn’t matter which college. It’s a perfectly respectable institution, though increasingly… diluted. And yes, it’s stressful. Terribly stressful. I’ve been doing it for… a very long time. Longer than most people have lived, I daresay. Are we getting somewhere with this, Doctor? Because my schedule…
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite. Long career. Stress can manifest in… various ways. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms related to this stress, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Hmm. Well… I do find myself rather… fatigued. More so than usual, perhaps. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Though I suspect that’s simply the dreadful cafeteria food. Everything is so… bland. No, no, nothing serious. Just… general weariness. The sort one accumulates after decades of trying to instill a love of Dewey Decimal in… unappreciative minds. Is that what you want to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and appetite changes. Alright. And are you having any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Oh, yes. The noise. Honestly, the students these days… always something. Music, shouting, activities. It’s a constant disturbance. I used to have a very regular sleep schedule, you understand. Eight hours, precisely. Now? It’s… fragmented. I wake up several times a night. Though I wouldn’t say it’s a problem. I simply… adjust. One learns to cope. Are we nearly finished, Doctor? I have papers to grade.
DOCTOR: Fragmented sleep… alright. Any other changes you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I suppose I’ve become… rather irritable. Snappish, perhaps. Though honestly, it’s hard to be pleasant when one is surrounded by… mediocrity. My ex-wife used to say I was always grumpy, but that was simply because she didn’t understand the importance of proper cataloging. No, I don’t think it’s anything… significant. Just a natural consequence of… everything. Truly, Doctor, I am not one for… complaining. It’s simply… draining. Can we wrap this up now?
DOCTOR: Irritability… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Memory… concentration…? Oh, good heavens. Well… things do… slip my mind, from time to time. Names, mostly. Students’ names. It’s dreadful, really. So many faces, all blurring together. And sometimes… I misplace things. Papers, books… though I always find them eventually. It’s just… age, I suppose. One’s faculties aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything worth… mentioning. Are you writing all this down, Doctor? It seems rather… excessive. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of managing my own affairs.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Routine. Then we can discuss… options.
PATIENT: Physical exam? Really, Doctor? For a little stress? I assure you, my constitution is perfectly sound. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. But… very well. If you insist. Though I must warn you, I have a very low tolerance for… prodding. And I do dislike the cold stethoscope. Get it over with quickly, if you please. I have grading to do, you know. And a rather important faculty meeting this afternoon. Honestly, the waste of time…
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure. Please take a deep breath… and relax. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. And your breath sounds are a little diminished. Nothing alarming, but we should note it. Pulse is 78 and regular. Your reflexes are a little slow as well. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Good heavens. It’s probably the students. Honestly, the sheer ignorance… It’s enough to raise anyone’s blood pressure. And diminished breath sounds? I assure you, I breathe perfectly adequately. Perhaps it's the dust in that dreadful college library. There. Perfectly normal walking. Though I do find myself… a little lightheaded. Probably just the lack of a decent cup of tea. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Can we please be done with this now? I have papers to grade, and a perfectly good afternoon to waste… I mean, spend. Yes, spend.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. You do seem a little unsteady. And the lightheadedness is concerning. Given your elevated blood pressure, fragmented sleep, irritability, and some memory issues, I think it's best we do some further testing. A blood test to check your thyroid and vitamin levels, and an EKG to check your heart. Just to be on the safe side. I'm going to order those for you now. And I'd also like you to see a cardiologist, just for a full evaluation. I can write you a referral.
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Blood tests?! Doctor, with all due respect, this is utterly ridiculous. I came in here because I was stressed, not because I was… falling apart! Honestly, the overdiagnosis these days… it’s appalling. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. A little fatigued, perhaps, and a bit irritable, but who wouldn't be, dealing with… them? No. Absolutely not. I will not be subjected to a battery of unnecessary tests. I’m quite capable of managing my own health, thank you very much. And I certainly do not need to see a… a heart specialist. I’ll just take some time off, maybe drink more tea, and try to avoid the students. That will be quite sufficient. I think I’ve wasted enough of my afternoon on this… charade. Thank you for your time, Doctor, but I believe I’m quite capable of handling this myself. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration, but I am concerned about your health. While you may feel capable of managing, these symptoms could indicate a serious underlying condition. I strongly advise you to reconsider the testing and the cardiology referral. I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes recommending appropriate evaluations. I can’t in good conscience simply dismiss these concerns. At the very least, please promise me you’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks, so we can reassess. And I strongly recommend avoiding excessive stress. .
