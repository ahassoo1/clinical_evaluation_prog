DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. They said it was a little high on the blood test. I don't really understand what that means, but that’s why I’m here. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. We received your lab results, and your cholesterol is a little elevated. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Let’s talk about what that means and what we can do about it. First, do you have any family history of high cholesterol or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. I think it was something with his arteries getting blocked, but honestly, I wasn’t very involved in his medical things. My mother, she was healthy as a horse, though. Never a problem. Does that help? I remember her being very active, always walking.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. A family history of heart disease does increase your risk. And it’s good your mother was so active – lifestyle plays a big role. Okay, so we know your father had some heart issues. Do you recall if he had a specific diagnosis, like high cholesterol itself, or maybe a heart attack or angina?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… I think the doctor said something about hardening of the arteries. And he did have a procedure, a long time ago. It involved… tubes? And a little camera? I was pretty young, maybe ten or twelve, and it scared me a lot. I mostly remember my aunt taking care of me while he was in the hospital. I really don’t know what they called it, just that it was to help his heart. Sorry I’m not more help!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chelise. It sounds like he likely had an angiogram or angioplasty – those procedures use tubes and a camera to look at and open up blocked arteries. Okay, let's switch gears a bit and talk about you. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain in your legs when you walk?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. I feel pretty good, actually. I walk a lot – I live near a park, so I try to get out every day. And I do some gardening, which keeps me busy. No pain, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I was surprised when the nurse said my cholesterol was high, because I feel very healthy.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear you're so active and feeling well! It's good that you're prioritizing your health. Since you don't have any symptoms, we'll focus on getting a better understanding of your cholesterol levels and what might be contributing to them. Do you happen to know what your specific cholesterol numbers were?
PATIENT: You know, the nurse did say some numbers… but honestly, they all blurred together. I think she mentioned something about “good” and “bad” cholesterol, and a number that was too high? I'm terrible with remembering those sorts of things. I really don't have a clue what they were, exactly. Is it okay if you just tell me what should be good and what’s not? That might be easier for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s perfectly fine. Let's keep it simple. There are a few different types of cholesterol. LDL is often called “bad” cholesterol, and high levels can build up in your arteries. HDL is “good” cholesterol; it helps remove the LDL. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. Ideally, we want your LDL to be under 100, your HDL above 60, and your triglycerides under 150. Do you have any idea what your numbers were, even roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm...I remember the nurse saying my LDL was a little high. She said something about it being in the 130s, maybe? And I think she said my HDL was okay, not amazing, but not bad. She didn’t say anything about triglycerides, so I guess that one is probably fine? I’m really just guessing here, trying to remember what she said. It was a lot of information! Is 130 really bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. An LDL of 130 is a little elevated, yes, but not drastically so. It’s good that your HDL wasn’t low. Since it's only slightly high and you're feeling well, we don't need to jump to medication right away. Let’s talk about some lifestyle changes we can try first. First, what’s your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. I cook most of my meals at home. Lots of vegetables, some chicken or fish a few times a week. I do enjoy pasta, though. And I have a bit of a sweet tooth – I like cookies with my tea. I don’t eat a lot of red meat, maybe once a month. And I try to use olive oil instead of butter when I cook. Does that make sense? It's not perfect, but I feel like I eat reasonably well. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a pretty good base. The pasta, sweets, and wine are areas we can look at. Let's focus on small changes first. Reducing saturated and trans fats is key – those are often found in processed foods and red meat. Increasing fiber intake can also help lower cholesterol. And limiting added sugars is always a good idea. Do you know how much saturated fat you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh dear, I have absolutely no idea. I don't really pay attention to the fat content in my food, I just try to eat things that look healthy. I know I should probably be better about that, but it seems so complicated trying to read all the labels and figure out what’s good and what’s bad. Is there a certain type of food I should focus on cutting out first? Maybe that would be easier? I’m better at removing things than trying to measure everything.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach. Let's start with cutting back on processed foods. Things like cookies, packaged snacks, and pre-made meals often contain hidden saturated and trans fats. Aim to replace those with whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Also, try swapping butter for olive oil when you cook, if you haven’t already. How about your exercise routine?
PATIENT: Yes, I already use olive oil! I'm quite good about that one. And you're right, I do buy some pre-made things sometimes, like frozen dinners when I'm feeling tired. I will definitely try to cut back on those. As for exercise, I walk about an hour most days. Sometimes more if the weather is nice. I also do some gardening, which I think counts as exercise, right? I don't go to the gym or anything, I'm not really a gym person. Is walking enough?
DOCTOR: That's excellent! Walking an hour most days is fantastic. Gardening definitely counts as exercise, too! It sounds like you're already doing a lot of the right things. So, to recap: we’re focusing on reducing processed foods, aiming for more whole foods, and continuing your regular walking and gardening. Let's also try to limit added sugar. We can re-check your cholesterol levels in three months to see if these changes are making a difference. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable. Three months is a good amount of time, I think. I can definitely try to cut back on the cookies and frozen dinners. I'll pay more attention to the labels and try to eat more fruits and vegetables. No promises I'll be perfect, but I will do my best! And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. It’s not as scary as I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chelise! I'm glad I could help. Remember, small, sustainable changes are key. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions along the way. We'll see you in three months.
