DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Dashevsky, you say? Hmm. Well, I need a little something from you, if you don't mind. It's not... a big thing. Just a card.
DOCTOR: A card, sir?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. A “Get Well” card. Or... something encouraging. My daughter, she thinks I need one. She worries too much, you know? But, it would be nice to have, I suppose. A little… boost. She says it has to come from the doctor, though. Has to be official-like.
DOCTOR: I see. Your daughter is very thoughtful. While we don’t typically prescribe “get well” cards, I understand what you mean about it being encouraging coming from a medical professional. It sounds like she’s looking for reassurance that you’re being taken care of. Perhaps we can address what’s been on your mind health-wise, and then I can certainly write a note acknowledging that we’ve spoken and are working together on your wellbeing. Would that work?
PATIENT: Working together... yes, that sounds… proper. It's just… everything feels a little slow these days, you know? Not bad, just… not like it used to be. I keep things moving at the plant, always have. Everything has to be right. And… well, sometimes things aren't. It bothers my daughter, she says I need to relax. But relaxing doesn't fix things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're a very proactive person, someone who likes to be in control and keep things running smoothly. And it’s frustrating when things don't go as planned. It's also common to feel bothered when your energy levels aren’t what they used to be. When you say “slow,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I'm falling asleep on my feet, Doctor. It's just… taking longer to get things done. The boilers, they need constant attention, always have. But lately, it feels like I'm checking them twice as often, just to be sure. And the paperwork… don’t even get me started on the paperwork. Used to fly through it. Now, I have to… focus. It’s… tiring.
DOCTOR: That sounds challenging, Mr. Kammer. Increased effort for the same tasks, and needing to concentrate more… those are important things to note. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. My appetite, it isn't what it used to be. Not that I'm not eating, just… smaller portions. And I used to sleep like a log. Now, I wake up a couple of times a night. Just little things, you know? Nothing that a strong cup of coffee can't fix. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some disrupted sleep. And you manage with coffee, that's good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Now you're asking. I haven’t really looked. My daughter, she’s always on about my weight, says I need to watch it. But I’ve been too busy keeping the plant running to worry about… numbers. I’m probably the same, though. Maybe a little less, if anything. It's hard to say. I'm a tall man, you know? Always been lean.
DOCTOR: That's fair. It can be difficult to keep track of those things when you have a lot on your plate. And being tall can certainly make things seem different. Mr. Kammer, based on what you've described—the feeling of things being slower, increased effort, decreased appetite, and disrupted sleep—it would be helpful to do a basic physical exam and run a few blood tests. This will help us rule out any underlying medical causes for these changes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Hmm. I don't like being poked and prodded, Doctor. But… if it will get my daughter off my back, and you think it's important… alright. Do what you have to do. But I haven’t got all day, you know. Things are running at the plant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll be as efficient as possible. It won't take long, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. First, let's just check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. After that, we can do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Alright, alright. Let’s get it over with. But be gentle, Doctor. I've got important things to do. And I'm a big man, remember? Don't go poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… excellent. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart rate is 72, nice and steady. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Say "ah" for me… good. Throat looks normal. Ears are clear as well. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Just relax your arm… and your leg… good. Everything seems normal there. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I can follow your finger. Like watching a bug crawl, Doctor. Not difficult. Are we done yet? I’m starting to feel a little… restless.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Mr. Kammer. Just a few more quick checks. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that tight enough? I’ve been working with machinery my whole life, Doctor. I’ve got a strong grip.
DOCTOR: Excellent grip strength, very strong. Now, let's just check your gait, your walking pattern. Could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that fast enough? I don't see why I need to walk around like a penguin for you, Doctor. I walk perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: You walk with a steady gait, no noticeable issues. Okay, Mr. Kammer, that completes the physical exam. Based on the exam, everything appears relatively normal, but the changes you described - decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, and the feeling of things being slower - warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. This will help us rule out any underlying medical causes. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other medical supplies?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm. I don't think so. Never had any trouble with gloves or anything. But my daughter, she's always warning me about allergies. She reads everything on the internet, you know? I mostly just try to ignore it. But no, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Excellent. Okay, Mr. Kammer, I'll write the lab order now. You can go to the lab just down the hall. They'll take a small sample of your blood. The results should be back in a couple of days. In the meantime, I want you to try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night. And try to eat regular meals, even if you don't have a big appetite. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them and develop a plan to address your concerns. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sleep and eat. My daughter will be happy to hear that. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. I'm a busy man. And about that card… you will remember the card, right? It has to come from the doctor, officially.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. I haven't forgotten. Once we've reviewed the lab results, I’ll be happy to write a note acknowledging our consultation and our plan to work together on your wellbeing. It will be official, I assure you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to finish documenting the exam. The lab technician is expecting you down the hall. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just... don't let the results be anything serious, Doctor. I've got things to do. And the card... remember the card.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. We'll take good care of you. And I will remember the card. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: A card… honestly.
