DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, that’s… a common sentiment, certainly. But high blood pressure – or hypertension, as we call it – is often a silent condition. Meaning, you don't necessarily feel symptoms until something serious happens. It’s the damage it’s doing without you noticing that we're concerned about. Still, let’s get a more detailed picture. When were you first told your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Elevated? I think it was… last month, maybe? At my yearly check-up with my primary care doctor. She just sort of… mentioned it. Didn’t really explain anything, just told me to follow up with someone. Honestly, doctors these days don't really tell you anything useful.
DOCTOR: Right. A rather… cursory explanation, it seems. Well, that’s what I’m here for. And yes, unfortunately, brevity is sometimes the issue with routine appointments. Now, do you recall what your blood pressure reading was at that yearly check-up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I never write those numbers down. Numbers aren't my thing. Is it… bad? Because I'm telling you, I feel perfectly fine. I work outside all day, so I'm pretty active, and I eat... reasonably. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Reasonably” is… subjective, Ms. Dudeney. We’ll get to your lifestyle shortly. And yes, uncontrolled high blood pressure is potentially dangerous, leading to things like heart disease, stroke, kidney problems… I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s important to understand the stakes. Let’s start with some specifics. First, let's take your blood pressure again, to confirm the initial reading. Then, I'd like to ask you some questions about your medical history, family history, and lifestyle. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do today, you know. This is taking up my whole morning already. But alright, ask your questions. Just… try to be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I'm doing this, I'll begin. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… the usual female things, I guess. But nothing serious. And I've never been hospitalized, if that's what you’re asking. I pride myself on good health. Well, was proud. Until this blood pressure thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. 148 over 92. As you can see, that is elevated. Consistently high readings like this are what concern us. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. I'm pretty careful, you know? Avoid risky things. I've never even broken a bone, which is more than I can say for my husband. Always falling off something or getting into trouble. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom had… something. With her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my dad, he had diabetes. He wasn’t very good about taking care of himself. But that's it, really. No one else with blood pressure, as far as I know. They didn't really talk about health stuff much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen when my back acts up from working outside. That's it. I don't really like taking pills. They never seem to do anything anyway. Waste of money, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit more specifically. When you say you work outside, what exactly does that entail?
PATIENT: I'm a civil engineering technician. I survey land, check construction sites, that sort of thing. A lot of walking, a lot of being in the sun. It's physical work, definitely. But it’s not like I'm lifting things all day. Mostly just… walking and looking at stuff. And paperwork when I get back to the office, of course.
DOCTOR: And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Look, I eat normal food. Burgers, fries, sometimes a salad. I like my fry bread, okay? It's a Navajo thing. I don't eat that much of it. And I try to drink water. But it’s hard when it’s hot outside. I'm not going to pretend I'm a health nut, alright? I have a life.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand you’re… frustrated. And I appreciate your candor. However, fry bread, burgers, and a lack of consistent hydration aren't exactly conducive to healthy blood pressure. I’m not trying to lecture you, but these factors do contribute. Do you consume alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t need any of that. My husband drinks beer sometimes, but I don’t touch the stuff. And I’ve never smoked a day in my life. Seriously, doctor, do I look like the type? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t. And I apologize if my questions are feeling… intrusive. I assure you, I'm simply trying to gather a complete picture. Now, before we move on, could you tell me your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You're going to make me weigh myself? Fine. I’m… five foot ten and, uh, one-thirty. Give or take a few pounds. It fluctuates, you know? It's just water weight sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's perform a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It won't take long. This will help me get a better sense of your overall health. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly. I have a perfectly good life to get back to. And don’t tell me anything I don't want to hear, alright?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… normal. No murmurs or gallops detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Blood pressure remains elevated at 148/92 after several minutes of rest. No edema noted in extremities. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, aside from the persistently elevated blood pressure. Ms. Dudeney, given your blood pressure readings and lifestyle, it’s clear we need to address this. While you may not be experiencing symptoms, prolonged hypertension can lead to serious health problems.
