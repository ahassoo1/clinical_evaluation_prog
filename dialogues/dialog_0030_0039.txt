DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Quicksey. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. Seems my cholesterol is a bit high. Hyper… something-or-other, the paper said. I don’t rightly remember all the fancy words, but they said I should come talk to someone. Thought I’d best listen!
DOCTOR: Certainly. Hyperlipidemia, that’s the term – high cholesterol. It’s very good you came in to discuss this. We want to get a handle on it. To start, do you have a copy of that lab report with you today?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, here it is! A bit crumpled, I’m afraid. My wife always kept these things organized, but since she passed… well, things aren’t quite as tidy. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bohnett. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s understandable things haven’t been the same. Okay, so your total cholesterol is elevated at 245, your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. These numbers do indicate some cause for concern. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had a bit of trouble with my heart, knock on wood. Blood pressure's always been a little on the high side, the doctor at the VFW hall used to say, but he never wrote me a prescription or anything. And no diabetes, thankfully. I always thought I ate a pretty healthy diet, mostly… well, Swedish food. Lots of fish and potatoes. Though I do enjoy a good piece of pie now and then.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Swedish food can be quite healthy, especially with the fish. We'll talk about diet a bit more later. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. When I was a young man, I had my tonsils out. That was… oh, goodness, must have been seventy years ago! And I broke my leg once, playing football in high school. But other than that, no. Nothing major. I’ve been a pretty lucky fella, all in all. Oh! Wait, I had a gallbladder removed years ago, maybe twenty years back. That's it. That's everything, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils as a young man, a broken leg, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Thank you for remembering those details. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father, he lived to be eighty-five, which was good for his time. He was a strong man, worked on the docks his whole life. My mother, she died younger, maybe in her sixties, from… I think it was pneumonia. And I had one brother, he passed away a few years back from a stroke. As far as I know, nobody on either side of the family had much trouble with their hearts, but my brother did have high blood pressure, now that I think about it. He didn't take care of himself very well, always smoking and drinking.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bohnett. It’s helpful to know. So, father to 85, mother at 60s from pneumonia, brother with high blood pressure… and no known heart issues otherwise. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone now, as I mentioned. I try to stay active, though it’s not as easy as it used to be. I do a little gardening, mostly vegetables. And I walk down to the VFW hall most days to play a bit of cards with the fellas. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a beer or two with dinner now and then. I used to work as a supervisor, overseeing protective service workers, but I retired about fifteen years ago. It keeps me busy, mostly. Trying to stay out of trouble!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good, active lifestyle for someone your age, Mr. Bohnett. And staying engaged is very important. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, or are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. And I’m not taking any prescriptions right now. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor took me off of it a few years back, said it wasn’t doing much good. I take a multivitamin every day, and sometimes I’ll take an aspirin if I’ve got a headache, but that’s about it. Oh! And I take fish oil sometimes, for my joints. Doc said it might help.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, multivitamin daily, aspirin as needed, and fish oil occasionally. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, that gives me a good understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds just fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’m used to it, being an old man!
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/85, which is a little elevated, as we discussed, and your heart rate is 72, which is good. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good in all extremities. Finally, I’d like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon for someone your age. Overall, everything sounds pretty good, Mr. Bohnett, but the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur are things we’ll want to address.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound too bad, Doctor. I've always been a bit of a worrier, so I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. So, what do you think we should do about this cholesterol then? Is it something I need to be really concerned about? I don't want to end up with one of those fancy machines stuck in my chest!
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Bohnett. It's good you're proactive about your health. We certainly don’t want any fancy machines! Your cholesterol levels are elevated, and that does increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. However, it’s something we can manage with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. The first step I recommend is dietary changes. Reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and eating more fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids can help lower your LDL cholesterol. I also recommend regular exercise – even a brisk walk for 30 minutes most days of the week can make a difference. And if you're a smoker, quitting is the best thing you can do for your health. You've already got the smoking part covered, which is fantastic! We can also repeat your cholesterol levels in three months to see if these lifestyle changes are making a difference. If they're not enough, we can discuss the possibility of starting a statin medication. Statins are very effective at lowering cholesterol, and they have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. What are your thoughts on starting with lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I can certainly try to eat a bit healthier. My daughter's always telling me I need to eat more vegetables, so maybe I’ll listen to her for once! And I do enjoy my walks down to the VFW hall, so I can try to make those a bit more… purposeful. I’m not keen on taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it, so I’d like to see if I can get things under control with diet and exercise first. Three months sounds like a good timeframe. Should I keep doing the fish oil too, or should I stop that? And is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent approach, Mr. Bohnett. Starting with lifestyle changes is always the best first step. You can continue the fish oil, yes. It’s generally safe and may have some additional heart benefits. Just be sure to let me know if you experience any side effects, like upset stomach or a fishy aftertaste. As for other things, I recommend managing your stress levels. Stress can raise your blood pressure and cholesterol. Finding healthy ways to cope with stress, like spending time with loved ones, practicing relaxation techniques, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy, can be helpful. Also, it’s important to monitor your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. I'd like you to check it twice a day, in the morning and evening, and keep a record of your readings to bring with you at your next appointment. Finally, are you up to date on your vaccinations, specifically your flu and pneumonia vaccines?
PATIENT: Well, I try not to let stress bother me too much. I have my daughter and my buddies at the VFW hall, so I’ve got plenty of support. I do enjoy gardening, so that helps me relax too. I think I got a flu shot last year, but I can’t rightly remember about the pneumonia vaccine. It was at the VFW hall, I think. I should probably check with them. I do have a blood pressure cuff at home, actually. My daughter bought it for me a while back. I haven't used it much, to be honest. I’ll start using it regularly now, and keep a record of the readings. You know, Doctor, you’re making me feel a bit better already. It’s good to have a plan.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Bohnett. That’s my goal – to help you feel informed and empowered to take control of your health. Okay, so we’ve agreed on lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress management – and regular blood pressure monitoring. Continue the fish oil. And please check with the VFW hall about your pneumonia vaccination. I’m going to write you a referral to a registered dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance on creating a heart-healthy eating plan. And I’ll also give you some handouts on heart-healthy eating and stress management. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to repeat your cholesterol levels and discuss your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. That’s a lot of information, but I’ll do my best to follow your advice. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you for the referral to the dietitian. That’s a good idea. I guess I’ll see you in three months then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. .
