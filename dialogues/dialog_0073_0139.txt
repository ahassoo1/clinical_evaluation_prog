DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I... need check for referee. For fitness. They want me to get check before I can... do games. It's for basketball, mostly.
DOCTOR: A referee physical… right. I see. Well, we can certainly do a fitness assessment, though it's not quite how we usually phrase it. Just to clarify, are you looking for a general check-up to ensure you're healthy enough to officiate, or is there a specific form you need completed?
PATIENT: Specific form. Yes. They gave me paper. Said I need doctor sign. Something about heart... and running. I don't know. It's for the league. I just want to finish quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a league-required form. That explains it. Let's pull that up… Do you happen to have the form with you, Mr. Shanor?
PATIENT: Yes, here. It's... a little wrinkled. Sorry. I keep it in bag.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. This is… fairly standard. It does focus heavily on cardiovascular health, as you mentioned. We’ll need to go through some questions, and I'll need to perform a physical exam. Do you have any known heart conditions, or has a doctor ever told you you have a heart problem?
PATIENT: No. Never. I feel... okay. Sometimes a little tired after running, but... I’m not young. It’s normal, I think. My wife... she always said I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. “Not young” is relative. And worrying is… common. Let’s get some specifics about this tiredness. When do you experience it?
PATIENT: After games. Maybe halfway through, start feel... heavy. Like can't breathe good. I stop, rest. Usually okay after ten minute. But... it's getting worse, maybe. Last game, longer rest. That's why I come. I don't want... problem.
DOCTOR: I understand. Progressive shortness of breath during exertion is something we need to investigate. Now, aside from the tiredness and shortness of breath, have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations – that's a racing or fluttering heart – or dizziness during these games or at any other time?
PATIENT: No chest pain. Sometimes… little dizzy. But only when I stand up fast. Old man problem, I think. Never with the heart. Not during game. Just… when I get up quick. Everything go... blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, positional dizziness is good to know, though we’ll want to rule out other causes. Now, let's move onto some other areas. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don’t take any pills. Just... vitamins. Old lady at the store said good for energy. But they don’t help much. I think she just wanted sell me something.
DOCTOR: Vitamins… right. Well, we’ll stick to medical history for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No surgery. Hospital... when my wife... she sick. Long time ago. She had… something with lungs. But that was her. I was just… visiting. Nothing for me. I healthy, always. Before... everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must have been difficult. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any heart conditions, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes in your immediate family – your parents, siblings, or children?
PATIENT: My mother… she had pressure. High. Took pills for it. My father... strong man. Never sick. Sister… okay. No problem. She work in factory. Very strong too. I think my side... good genes. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to complete the picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. No smoke. No drink. No... those things. My wife... she didn't like those things. I stopped long time ago. Before... everything. It's bad for heart, I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Let’s get it over with. I have games next week. Need this paper signed. Soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit comfortably, and try to relax. First, we’ll take your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let’s listen to your heart now. Rhythm is regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not alarming, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I'll listen to your lungs. Breath sounds are clear, though slightly diminished at the bases. Finally, I'll check your reflexes and perform a brief neurological assessment. Reflexes are normal, and neurological function appears intact. Overall, your physical exam reveals some concerning findings that warrant further investigation before I can sign off on this form.
PATIENT: What… what concerning? Is it bad? I need to referee. I promised. What do I need to do? Can I still sign the paper?
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your concern, and I'm not trying to alarm you. However, the elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur, combined with your report of progressive shortness of breath, are things we need to take seriously. I cannot sign this form in good conscience without further evaluation. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. We need to rule out underlying cardiac issues. I recommend an electrocardiogram – that’s an EKG – to assess your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Depending on those results, we may also need to consider an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of the heart. I can schedule these tests for you immediately. In the meantime, I advise against strenuous activity, including refereeing, until we have a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you like me to proceed with scheduling those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. That’s… expensive. And I promised the league. They need someone. I don't have money for... echo-thing. Can't I just... take some pills? For blood pressure? My neighbor has some. He said they work good. Please. Just sign the paper. I need to work. Everything else is... before. Everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand you're worried about the cost and your commitment to the league. But taking medication prescribed to someone else is extremely dangerous and could have serious consequences. It's not a solution, and it's not something I can condone. And while I sympathize with your situation, I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your health and safety. Signing this form without proper evaluation would be a disservice to you and could put you at risk. Regarding the cost, we do have payment plan options available, and we can explore potential financial assistance programs. Let's focus on getting you the necessary tests so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a safe and effective treatment plan. I strongly recommend we schedule the EKG and chest X-ray as soon as possible. We can discuss the financial aspects afterward. Are you willing to proceed with scheduling those tests, or would you like me to refer you to a cardiologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: …Okay. Tests. Just… do the tests. Soon. I need to know. I need to referee. Before… everything. Just… please. Just get it done. I don’t want to… talk about everything anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Shanor. I understand. I'll have my assistant schedule the EKG and chest X-ray for you immediately. They’ll contact you with the appointment times. In the meantime, I'm going to write a note recommending you avoid strenuous activity until we have the results. And I'll also include a referral to a cardiologist, just in case further evaluation is needed. They are excellent and can offer a more specialized opinion. I'll print out a summary of our conversation and the test orders for you to take with you. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me as soon as you have the test results. We’ll discuss them together and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I… I should go now. Need to call the league. Tell them. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Shanor. Take your time. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or questions. We’re here to help. Have a good day, despite everything. .
