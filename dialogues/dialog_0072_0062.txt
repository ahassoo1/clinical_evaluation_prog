DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re forty-seven years old. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Yes, forty-seven is correct. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I’m here today regarding the requirements at my place of work – about wearing masks and other protective equipment. It’s causing a bit of a…well, a difficulty for me, and I need to request an exemption, I believe.
DOCTOR: An exemption, you say. From the mask requirements at your workplace. Alright. Before we discuss exemptions, let's understand the nature of this "difficulty" you're experiencing. Can you elaborate on what specifically is causing the problem?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not a discomfort, exactly, though some folks might feel that way. It’s more… a feeling. A weight, almost. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and I’ve always relied on being… present, aware of my surroundings, attuned to the people I’m assisting. When I have something covering my face, even for a short time, it feels like a barrier. It makes it harder to…connect, to read the subtle cues that are important in my line of work. It’s a hard thing to explain, I admit. I’ve been doing this work a long time, and I’ve always felt most effective when I can see and be seen.
DOCTOR: I understand you're finding the mask interferes with your ability to perform your job effectively, specifically impacting your perceived connection with those you assist. It sounds as though you feel it diminishes your ability to read nonverbal cues. Now, has this feeling of being “barriered” or diminished awareness resulted in any concrete issues with your work performance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it has. Not major incidents, thankfully, but…smaller things. I’ve had a couple of instances where I misread a situation, or didn't pick up on a distress signal as quickly as I normally would. One time, a client was very hesitant to share information, and I didn’t realize it until much later. Another time, a situation escalated slightly because I didn’t immediately recognize the fear in someone’s eyes. These are things I’ve always prided myself on – noticing the small details, the things people don’t say – and it’s…concerning to me that the mask is affecting that. It’s not a safety issue yet, but I fear it could become one.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re experiencing subtle but noticeable difficulties in assessing situations and reading nonverbal cues, which you attribute to the mask impeding your usual level of awareness. You've correctly identified this as a potential safety concern. Now, to get a clearer picture, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. I've generally been quite healthy. No major illnesses or surgeries to speak of. I do have some minor arthritis in my knees, which is common in my family, but it doesn’t impact my work. I’ve never been diagnosed with any anxiety or…well, anything affecting my mental state. I take a daily vitamin D supplement, as we don't get much sun where I live. I’ve been a Medicare recipient for a few years now. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about? I’ll do my best to recall anything that might be relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history, minor arthritis, vitamin D supplementation, Medicare. That's helpful. And are you currently taking any other medications, beyond the vitamin D?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the vitamin D. I try to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest. I haven’t had a need for any other medications, thankfully. I don't smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. I’m trying to be as upfront as possible, as I understand how important it is to have an accurate understanding of my health before considering an exemption. It’s not something I take lightly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your thoroughness, Mr. Knabenshue. Now, regarding your family history, are there any conditions that run in your family – perhaps neurological or psychiatric conditions, or anything affecting sensory perception?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… On my mother’s side, there was a great-aunt who suffered from… well, what they called “nerves” back then. I suppose it could have been anxiety, but it wasn't formally diagnosed. She was very sensitive, easily overwhelmed. My father’s side is… more stoic, less prone to talking about feelings. There’s a history of diabetes, but nothing else that I’m aware of affecting the mind or senses. My grandfather was a skilled tracker, very attuned to his surroundings, so perhaps a sensitivity to perception runs in the family, though in a different way. I’m not sure if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright. A family history of possible anxiety on your mother’s side, and a predisposition towards heightened perception in your grandfather. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your vital signs, neurological function, and do a basic sensory assessment. It’s standard procedure to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your sensitivity. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed at your own pace. I’m here to cooperate in any way I can. I want to make sure we cover all the bases. I appreciate you taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here on the examination table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to perform a brief neurological exam, testing your coordination and balance. Please follow my finger with your eyes, keeping your head still. Eye movements are normal. Now, can you touch your nose with your finger, then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you go. And now... Like this? I believe that was correct. I’ve always been fairly coordinated, though I haven’t been doing much physical activity lately. Mostly just walking. Is there anything else I can do for this test? I want to be sure I'm performing it properly.
DOCTOR: Very good. Coordination appears intact. Now, let’s assess your sensory perception. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your hands and arms with this cotton swab. Please tell me when and where you feel the touch. And…?
PATIENT: There…yes, I feel it. Just there, on my forearm. And…now there, on the back of my hand. A very light touch…almost a tingling sensation. I can feel it, but it’s not strong. It’s… subtle. It’s always been harder for me to pinpoint exactly where I feel something, more of a general awareness. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sensory perception is present, though you describe it as subtle and requiring focused attention to pinpoint the exact location. That’s noted. Now, one final observation: I notice you appear to be quite… attuned to your surroundings. You seem to be aware of subtle shifts in the room, the angle of the light, even the sound of the ventilation system. Is this something you've always been conscious of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s…accurate. It’s something I’ve always just been aware of. I can’t explain it, really. It's not a conscious effort, more like an instinctive understanding of the environment. It's been helpful in my line of work, allowing me to anticipate potential issues and read people more effectively. It's just… part of how I experience the world. It's what makes the mask so disruptive, because it dampens that awareness, makes me feel disconnected. It’s difficult to describe, I know. I hope you can understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Knabenshue. You’ve provided a very thorough account of your experience. Your neurological exam is normal, your sensory perception is intact, though you describe it as subtle, and you demonstrate a heightened awareness of your surroundings. However, your subjective experience is what’s most important here. Based on my assessment, there are no clear medical contraindications to mask wearing, but your concerns are valid, and it appears the mask significantly impacts your ability to perform your job effectively. Now, before we discuss potential exemptions, I want to be cautious. While I don’t see a medical reason to exempt you, I’m also not comfortable dismissing your concerns. To be absolutely thorough, I recommend a consultation with a neurologist who specializes in sensory processing. They can perform more in-depth testing to rule out any underlying conditions and provide a more definitive assessment. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: That sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. A consultation with a specialist would certainly be helpful, to have a more definitive answer. I’m happy to pursue that. I appreciate your caution, and your willingness to take my concerns seriously. I wouldn’t want to request an exemption without having done everything possible to understand the situation. If you have a recommendation for a neurologist, I’d be grateful. I want to be thorough, as you said.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have a colleague, Dr. Evelyn Reed, who specializes in sensory processing disorders. She’s excellent. Here's her contact information and a referral request form I’ll send electronically to her office. In the meantime, until you've seen Dr. Reed, I advise continuing to wear a mask as tolerated. We don't want to jeopardize anyone's safety, including your own. And to be clear, this referral does not guarantee an exemption. Dr. Reed's assessment will determine whether a medical exemption is warranted. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I do. That all sounds very clear. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and to provide this referral. I’ll reach out to Dr. Reed’s office and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to take my concerns seriously. It means a lot. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s my job to listen and provide the best possible care. I wish you all the best with your consultation. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
