DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Terasa MayHugh. Look, I don't mean to rush you, doctor, but I have a bit of a day ahead of me. I just… well, things keep happening, and I’d like to get to the bottom of it if we can.
DOCTOR: Right, right. "Busy." Look, I get it. Everybody's busy. So, what exactly is “happening”?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s like the room spins, you know? And then my hearing just… goes. Not completely, but muffled. Like someone turned the volume down. It doesn’t last long, usually, but it’s frightening. And my… my husband, bless him, he used to get it too. That’s why I came. It runs in the family, I think. Though… honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Spinning room and muffled hearing… okay. How often does this happen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Not often, often. Maybe… once or twice a month? Sometimes it’s weeks, sometimes it’s… I honestly can’t recall. It feels random. It’s not like a regular thing, but enough to worry me. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Especially when it happens unexpectedly.
DOCTOR: “Unsettling.” Right. And is there anything that brings it on?
PATIENT: That’s the thing! No, not that I’ve noticed. It just… happens. I haven’t been doing anything different. I haven’t changed my… well, I don’t even know what would cause it. It’s not like I’m stressed or anything… well, not more than usual. I just… sit and play the slots mostly. It comes on even when I'm resting. It’s really quite baffling, doctor.
DOCTOR: “Slots,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. At the casino. I… I like to keep busy, as I mentioned. It’s just a hobby. Though, I assure you, it doesn’t have anything to do with… well, with this. It's just… something to do. A way to pass the time. Really. I’m not… I don’t drink or anything. Just the slots. It’s not a lot, usually. Though sometimes… well, never mind. It’s not important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have a bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands. Nothing major, just a little stiffness. And my blood pressure… the nurse always says it’s a bit high, but I take a little pill for that. Otherwise… no, not really. I was perfectly healthy, until this started happening. That's why I'm worried, you see. It feels… new. And my husband, like I said, he had similar problems before… well, before he passed.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, hypertension… And your husband had… what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It was… dizziness, mostly. And the hearing loss, just like me. He saw doctors, of course, but… they couldn’t really figure it out. Something about… balance, I think? He had tests, a lot of tests, but they never found anything concrete. He just… learned to live with it, eventually. It didn’t stop him from enjoying his life, but it was always there, lurking in the background. It's… a bit frightening to think I might be going through the same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, um… not that I know of. Never really bothered with those. Maybe a little sniffle during pollen season, but nothing a tissue couldn’t handle. I haven't taken anything for allergies in years. Honestly, doctor, I'm not much for taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to let nature take its course, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you are taking currently?
PATIENT: Just the one, for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small white pill. I take it every morning, with my breakfast. That’s it. Truly. I try to keep things simple, you see. Too many pills just make me feel… cloudy. And I need to be sharp, especially when… well, you know. When I’m at the casino. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Stand up for me, please.
