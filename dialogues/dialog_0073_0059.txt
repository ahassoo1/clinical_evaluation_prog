DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um... well, it's my speech, I think. It's been... difficult. Not clear, like I'm mumbling sometimes, or words get jumbled. It’s hard to explain, honestly. I just... noticed it.
DOCTOR: Difficult speech… noticed it recently?
PATIENT: Recently… yes. It’s not been long, maybe a few weeks? It's hard to say exactly, everything feels a little… fuzzy. I don’t really remember when it started, just that it’s happening now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Fuzzy… right. Well, it's not uncommon for things to come on gradually. A few weeks. And is this difficulty constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Some days it's barely noticeable, and others... well, like today, a bit. It's worse when I'm tired, I think. Or if I've been talking for a while. Not always, but often. I'm a construction manager, so I do a lot of talking. But I don't know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Construction manager, yes. A demanding job. And you say it worsens with fatigue... alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been a little clumsier than usual, maybe? Dropped my coffee this morning, which isn’t like me. And… sometimes my vision feels a bit blurry, but I wear glasses, so I just assumed that needed adjusting. I'm not sure if that's connected, though. Everything just feels a bit off, really.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and blurry vision… alright. Do you have a history of headaches, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. I get them sometimes, like anyone, but nothing frequent or severe. Just the normal sort, I think. Nothing that would explain this, surely. It's just… worrying, you know? I need to be sharp at work.
DOCTOR: Well, headaches are remarkably common. Let’s move on. Now, I'm going to need to ask about your medical history. Any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… Oh dear. Honestly, Doctor, I don't really… keep track of those things. I've been generally healthy, I think. A few colds, the flu, you know… normal things. I had chickenpox when I was a child, of course. And I think I broke my arm once, a long time ago. But nothing… serious. I’m married, and my husband usually handles all the medical stuff. I just… show up when I need to. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Right. Generally healthy. Any surgeries, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t think so. Definitely no surgeries. I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Nothing major has ever happened. I’m really not good with remembering dates and details, Doctor. Sorry. I hope that’s not a problem.
DOCTOR: Not a problem, per se. Now, are there any illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family illnesses… Hmm. My grandmother… she had something with her heart, I think. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had diabetes. But… that's all I can really remember, to be honest. We don’t really talk about it much. It’s not a habit, I suppose. It was a long time ago too. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking anything – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just my usual vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes Vitamin D in the winter. And occasionally ibuprofen for headaches, if needed, but not regularly. That’s it, really. Nothing else. I really don’t take a lot of medication, Doctor. I prefer to stay natural if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Swaby, I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam, if you don't mind. Just to assess your speech and coordination. It’s routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever I need to. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Just let me know what you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head, just your eyes. Please keep your gaze on the pen.
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Is that alright? It feels a little… strange. I'm trying to keep my head still. Just let me know if I’m doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: Fine. Now, I'd like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Squeeze as hard as you are able.
PATIENT: Is that alright? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can. It feels… okay, I suppose. It doesn’t feel any different than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's test your speech again. Can you repeat after me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try my best. It might be a little… rough, but I'll do my best to repeat what you say.
DOCTOR: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
PATIENT: “Thuh… quick… bruh-own… fox… jumps… ovuh… the… lay-zee… dog.” Was that… alright? It feels harder than it should be.
DOCTOR: I see. And now, let’s test your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. Just a few steps? Like this? Is that alright? It feels… a bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that will do. Please sit down now. Ms. Swaby, based on this preliminary examination, there appears to be some subtle incoordination and slurring of speech. This warrants further investigation. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. I'll also order blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and other potential causes.
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work? Oh dear. Is it… serious, Doctor? What could be causing this? I’ve never had an MRI before. It sounds… frightening. And what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Now, now, Ms. Swaby, let's not jump to conclusions. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious. Many things can cause these subtle symptoms. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a minor neurological issue, or even stress. The MRI is simply a precaution to rule out anything more concerning. It's a painless procedure. As for the blood work, it's routine. We need to have a baseline to understand what's going on. We will send the results to a neurologist as well, to get a second opinion. I want you to schedule these tests as soon as possible. I’ll give you a referral slip, and the front desk can assist you with scheduling. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… That sounds… quite serious. I was hoping it was just… tiredness, or stress. But if you’re sending me to a specialist… I suppose it’s best to be thorough. I’m not sure I understand everything, to be honest. What kind of neurological issue are you worried about? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work, and my husband… he handles most things, and I don't want to worry him unnecessarily. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, I understand your anxiety, but it’s important to remain calm. I’m not worried per se, I simply want to rule out all possibilities. The MRI will help us assess for things like small strokes, tumors, or demyelinating diseases – though, again, these are just possibilities. As for the timeframe, the results should be available in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen significantly – severe headache, weakness, vision changes – go to the emergency room immediately. I will also have my nurse call you in a few days to check on you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Small strokes… tumors… Oh dear. A week… that feels like a very long time. Yes, I understand. Rest… stay hydrated… and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all I need for now. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in touch. Have a good day, Ms. Swaby.
