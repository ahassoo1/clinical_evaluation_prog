DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, um… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? I don’t… I don’t really know when it started, honestly. It’s just been… there. It’s a bit annoying, to be frank. I’d like to get it sorted if possible, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness in your ear. And you said you’re not sure when it started, just that it’s been present for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about that "bit"?
PATIENT: Hmm… a bit… Yes. Probably… a week? Maybe two? It’s hard to say. Things just… blur these days, you know? I’ve been busy with the farm. Harvesting mostly. It's just… not been going away. I don’t remember doing anything to cause it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or two of fullness, no specific injury or event that you recall. Do you have any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Not pain, exactly. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like pressure, maybe? And it makes it hard to hear sometimes. Especially when it’s quiet. It's not sharp pain, thankfully. I get enough of that with the machinery.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp pain, just pressure and difficulty hearing, especially in quiet environments. Have you noticed any other symptoms – dizziness, ringing in your ear, any discharge or fluid coming from your ear?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. No, I don’t think so. Ringing… sometimes, maybe? It’s… faint. I thought it was just the quiet of the house, to be honest. My wife… she always liked a quiet house. And no, no discharge, nothing like that. Just the fullness. It's the fullness that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or discharge, maybe some faint ringing. Let's do a quick look in your ears. I'm going to gently examine your ear canals and eardrums. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Just let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive.
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, fine. Just… quickly, if you don’t mind. I really do have a lot to get done today. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some cerumen – earwax – buildup in both ears. It looks like it's significantly impacted, which is likely causing the fullness and difficulty hearing. There’s no sign of infection or any other obvious issues. Your eardrums look intact.
PATIENT: Earwax? Is that all? I… I didn’t even think of that. I suppose I haven’t really… cleaned my ears in a while. So, that’s it? Just wax? That’s… good, I suppose. Can you… remove it? Quickly?
DOCTOR: Yes, just wax buildup – cerumen impaction. Fortunately, it's very common. And yes, we can definitely remove it. We have a few options. We can try irrigation with warm water, or I can use a small instrument to gently remove it. Irrigation is usually quicker, but it doesn't always work if the wax is very hard. Are you comfortable with either option?
PATIENT: Irrigation sounds… faster. Yes, let’s try that one, please. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… appointments. And the harvest… Just… quickly and gently, if you could. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll use body-temperature water to avoid any dizziness. I’ll gently flush your ear canal, and you might feel some pressure. Let me know immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. It usually takes a few minutes per ear. We'll start with the left ear, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Left ear first, fine. Just… try to be quick, please. I really appreciate it. Let me know if I need to tell you anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m seeing some wax coming out. Alright, that looks much better. The wax is significantly reduced in both ears. Here you go. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… better, actually. Yes, much better. I can hear things more clearly. Still a little muffled, maybe, but definitely better. Thank you, Doctor. That was… quick. I appreciate that. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… is that it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. It's good to hear that it's improved. There's a small chance some wax remains, so I'd recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can push the wax further in. You can use over-the-counter earwax softening drops periodically if you feel any fullness returning. I’ll document this visit and give you a discharge summary with these instructions. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. No, that’s fine. Just… don’t use cotton swabs. And the drops, if it gets full again. Yes. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. You’ve been very efficient. I really appreciate your time. I should probably get going now, if you don’t mind. The harvest… .
