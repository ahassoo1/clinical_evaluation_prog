DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. Feels awful sick a lot of the time, and I don't even feel hungry, not like I used to. I get full after just a little bit of food. It's been going on for a little while now, and… honestly, it's worrying me. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it feels like… a few weeks, maybe? A month? Time just… slips away these days, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does have a way of doing that. A few weeks to a month of stomach discomfort and early fullness… that’s good to know. Could you describe the discomfort a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it's not a sharp pain, not really. More like… a queasy feeling, all the time. Like I'm going to be sick, but not always quite sick, you see? And sometimes it's just… a heavy feeling, right here . It's hard to explain. It doesn't really go away, even when I haven’t eaten. And, like I said, I barely have an appetite anymore. Everything just… tastes wrong, too, a little bit. I used to love cooking, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent queasy feeling and a diminished appetite, with a change in taste… those are important details. And it's helpful you mentioned the change in taste. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes I do get sick to my stomach. Not every day, mind you, but… often enough to be unpleasant. It's usually in the mornings, I think, or right after I try to eat something. It's not a lot, just… a little bit. And I feel so weak afterwards. It's… it’s hard to keep anything down, which is probably why I don’t want to eat, you know? It’s a bit of a… circle. I don’t want to feel sick, so I don't eat… and then I feel sick anyway.
DOCTOR: That is a difficult cycle, Ms. Kelder. And it's good you're recognizing that. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Oh, that's kind of you, thank you. . Let me think… other symptoms… well, I've been feeling more tired than usual, I suppose. Just… run down. And… oh, I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to, but I haven't really been weighing myself. I just haven't had the energy for it. And sometimes… sometimes I get a little breathless, just walking around the house. But I figured that was just my age, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath alongside the stomach issues… those are all things we should investigate further. Now, has there been any change in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… . Well, I haven't been… regular, if you know what I mean. More… constipated, I suppose. It's… uncomfortable. And I haven’t really been eating much, so I figured that was part of it. Everything feels… slow, just like everything else these days. I haven’t noticed anything… different, really, other than that it just… doesn’t happen as often.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Ask away. Let me see… Well, years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now? And I had some trouble with my blood pressure, but they got it under control with medication. I don't take anything for it anymore, though. The doctor said I didn't need to anymore. And… …I had cancer, a long time ago. Breast cancer. They did surgery and… well, I've been okay since then, for many years. I've had regular checkups, but… …it's always in the back of my mind, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Ms. Kelder. It’s important to know about your history of breast cancer, and I’m glad you’ve been diligent with your checkups. Do you recall what type of breast cancer it was, and when you were last seen by an oncologist?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was so long ago… I… I honestly don’t remember the type, Doctor. It was… invasive, I think? That's what the doctor told me, anyway. And the last time I saw an oncologist… let me think… it must have been… five years ago, maybe? For a routine checkup. They said everything looked good then, and… they didn't need to see me anymore after that. It’s just… everything feels different now, you see? That's why I'm worried. My memory isn't what it used to be, so I can't always recall these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you can't recall all the details. We can access your records to confirm everything. Now, have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal and the cancer surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. Years and years ago, I had my appendix taken out. When I was a young woman, it was. And… …let me see… Oh! I had a hysterectomy, too. A long time ago, when I was still married. That's all, I think. Nothing else that I can recall. My memory is so… patchy these days. It’s like little pieces missing from a puzzle.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. We’ll take our time and gather all the necessary information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Like I said, I don’t take anything for my blood pressure anymore. I take a little bit of calcium for my bones, and sometimes a multivitamin, but that's it. Just the basic stuff, you know? Nothing special. I try to eat healthy, but… it's hard when you don't feel like eating. I don't believe in taking a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with medications. I've always been pretty lucky, I think. Although… … I do get a little bit itchy sometimes when I'm around certain flowers. But that's just a little bit of a sniffle and an itch, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a bit of a complicated question, Doctor. My mother… she had heart trouble, and she passed away when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes. He lived to be a good old age, though. And my sister… she had arthritis, but that's about it, really. On my husband's side… … his mother had some kind of… stomach trouble, I think? But I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago. My family wasn’t really one for talking about illnesses, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. It’s helpful to know what you recall. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, I'm retired, so I don't work anymore. I used to be very active, I loved gardening and walking. But lately… I haven’t been doing much of anything, to be honest. It’s hard when you don't feel well. I live alone, since my husband passed away. I have a few friends, and we try to see each other when we can, but… it's not the same. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I used to enjoy cooking, but like I said, that’s not much fun anymore. I mostly just… sit around these days. .
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Kelder. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and gently examining your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you know? It's been so long since I felt like myself. Go right ahead. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, I’m listening to your heart now… everything sounds reasonably normal in terms of rate and rhythm. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a little bit tender, right… here. . Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And… maybe a little bit here, too. . It's hard to say, everything feels… sensitive. It doesn’t really hurt unless you press on it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. I’m noticing some tenderness in your upper abdomen, as you pointed out, particularly in the epigastric region – that’s the area right here. It doesn’t feel like there are any masses, but it is a bit sensitive to the touch. Your liver and spleen feel normal in size. I’m also checking for any rebound tenderness or rigidity, and I don’t detect any at this point. . I’m also going to listen to your bowel sounds.
PATIENT: Oh, all right. That's good to know, I guess. I just… I don't understand what's going on. It's just… been so unsettling. Go ahead and listen to my tummy, if you need to. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. Your bowel sounds are present, but they are a bit quieter than I would expect. . Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the examination, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. Given your history of breast cancer, your age, and your symptoms, we need to rule out any recurrence or metastasis. Additionally, the tenderness in your upper abdomen, diminished appetite, and weight loss could suggest a number of things – gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or even a gallbladder issue, despite having had your gallbladder removed years ago. . To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work and an abdominal ultrasound. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Blood work and an ultrasound… Is it something bad, Doctor? I just… I don't want to go through all that again. . But if you think it's necessary, then… yes, alright. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just hope it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder, and I want to assure you that we are taking a precautionary approach. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop the most appropriate treatment plan. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It’s often best to investigate these things thoroughly to rule out any potential issues. . The blood work will check your overall health, including your liver function, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. The abdominal ultrasound will allow us to visualize your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and other organs to identify any abnormalities. I’ll also order a complete blood count to check your red and white blood cell levels. . I’ll have my nurse schedule these tests for you at the lab across the street. They'll draw some blood, and you’ll have an ultrasound appointment later this week. We'll get the results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds alright, I suppose. A few days… it feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. The nurse will schedule it for me? That’s good. I’m not very good at making appointments myself these days. . I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I really do. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. It is a bit of a wait, but it’s important to gather all the information before making any decisions. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent and will take care of everything for you. She’ll schedule the blood work and the ultrasound, and she'll explain all the details. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, or bloody stools – please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. . Until we have the test results, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding fatty foods, and staying hydrated. If you're feeling nauseous, try ginger ale or saltine crackers. . We'll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Kelder. And please remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, no… I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds… reasonable. Smaller meals, stay hydrated… I can do that. And I’ll remember to call if anything gets worse. Thank you… thank you so much for listening to me. It’s… it’s a relief just to have someone take me seriously. . I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. Sarah will be in to see you shortly to schedule your tests. And again, please remember to prioritize rest and stay hydrated. . It was lovely meeting you. Have a good day, Ms. Kelder, and we’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: Oh, you too, Doctor. Thank you again. . Goodbye.
