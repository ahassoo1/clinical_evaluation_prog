DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Vanochten. Um... it’s my stomach, I guess. It's been... well, it’s been going on for a bit now. Just… a lot of diarrhea. It's pretty constant, really. I feel like I'm always running to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant diarrhea… and how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's a good question. Honestly? It feels like… months? Maybe two or three? It comes and goes, but it hasn't really gone gone, you know? I'm really bad with dates, sorry. It's just been… a while. I think it was worse a little while ago, and now it's… less bad, but still happening all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months. That's helpful. And when you say “less bad,” can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Before, like, a month or so ago, I was going to the bathroom constantly. Several times an hour sometimes. And it was… really watery, and I felt awful afterwards. Now, it's more like… maybe three or four times a day? Still loose, but not as… urgent, I guess? And I don't feel quite as weak after, but I still don’t feel great. I'm just tired a lot, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s improved somewhat, but still significantly impacting your daily life. And you mentioned feeling tired. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely impacting things. I have to plan everything around where the bathroom is! Um… let me think. Sometimes I get cramps, you know, in my stomach. Not awful, but uncomfortable. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight? My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really been checking. Honestly, I’m just glad it’s not as bad as it was. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramps and potential weight loss. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don't think so. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. It’s… well, it’s not something I usually check for. Sorry, that sounds gross. I just… I try not to look too closely, if you know what I mean. Would I notice it?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. You would likely notice it. Okay. And have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or vomiting. And… I think I felt a little nauseous once or twice, but it didn't last long and I definitely didn’t throw up. It was just… a wave of feeling sick to my stomach, and then it went away. It wasn't anything major. Mostly, it’s just the… constant bathroom trips and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: It's been... off, I guess. I don't really feel hungry a lot. I still eat, because I know I have to, but I don’t really want to. I’m not forcing myself to eat a ton, but I’m definitely eating less than usual. Small portions. Things that won’t… upset my stomach, you know? Like, I've been avoiding dairy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite and avoiding dairy. Have you noticed any bloating or gas?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah! Bloating, definitely. I look… well, I look pregnant sometimes! And gas, too. Lots of gas. Especially after… after I eat, I think. It's pretty embarrassing, actually. My husband jokes about it, but it's not really funny when I'm feeling uncomfortable all the time. I try to avoid beans and stuff, but it seems like anything can set it off sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, bloating and gas. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I take a multivitamin, that’s about it. And… I think I’m allergic to penicillin. I know I was as a kid, and I haven't tried it since. Nothing else that I know of. I haven't really had any serious allergies, thankfully. Just the penicillin, and sometimes my skin gets a little itchy if I use certain soaps, but it's not a big deal. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and a penicillin allergy. Good to know. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just checking your abdomen, listening to your bowel sounds, and maybe checking your weight and blood pressure. Just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm not a big fan of doctors, but I know it's probably important. I just… hope it doesn't take too long. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Your abdomen is… slightly tender to the touch in the lower quadrants, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. Your weight is 86 kilograms, which is a change from previous records. And your blood pressure is 120/80, which is normal. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome , but we'll need to rule out other possibilities. To do that, I'd like to order a stool test to check for infection and inflammation, and a blood test to check for Celiac disease and other potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… IBS? That sounds… complicated. Stool test and blood test, okay. So, is that… serious? I mean, is it something I need to worry about a lot? And… what happens if it is something else? I just… get a bit anxious about this kind of stuff. I guess I should have written down some questions. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, and you should absolutely ask questions. IBS itself isn't life-threatening, but it can be very disruptive to your daily life. We manage it with dietary changes, stress reduction, and sometimes medication to help with the symptoms. The stool and blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes, like infections, inflammation, or Celiac disease, which do require specific treatment. If it turns out to be something else, we'll discuss the appropriate treatment options. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. How… how do I do the stool test? Is it… difficult? I’m sorry, I know it’s a silly question. It's just… a bit embarrassing to think about. And… where do I get the blood drawn? Do I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all. It’s a perfectly reasonable question. You’ll receive a collection kit from the lab with instructions. Basically, you’ll collect a small sample of stool in a container and bring it back to the lab. They'll give you detailed instructions on how to do it properly to get an accurate result. As for the blood test, you can have it done at the clinic lab right here. No appointment needed. You’ll just need to fill out a quick form. The lab is just down the hall. I will send an order electronically. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Okay. Stool test kit, and blood test down the hall. I'll... I'll try to get it done as soon as possible. Thank you, Dr. Vanochten. You've been very helpful, even though… well, it’s not a very pleasant topic. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Try not to worry too much, and let the front desk know if you have any trouble getting the tests scheduled. We'll follow up once the results are back.
