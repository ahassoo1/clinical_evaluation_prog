DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, well, the army… they want me to take a test. Before they… you know… let me in. Seems silly, really. I feel fine. Always have. But they got rules, I guess. So here I am. Waste of a good day, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this is a pre-enlistment physical?
PATIENT: Physical? Is that what they call it? Sounds fancy. It’s a test. They want to see if I’m… strong enough. Smart enough. All that. I build engines, you know. Real things. Not… tests. Do I look like I can’t handle it?
DOCTOR: Well, even those who look quite capable need to be assessed, Mr. Hartness. It’s standard procedure. We need to get a baseline understanding of your current health. Now, let’s start with a little history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? You mean like… scrapes? I work with machines, doctor. There’s always a cut here and there. Nothing serious. Never broken anything. Sick? Not really. Maybe a cold now and then, but who hasn’t had a cold? I’m Swedish, you know. We’re built tough. What kind of illnesses are you even thinking about? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand your frustration. Let’s try this another way. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No! Never. Absolutely not. What kind of doctor are you even thinking I am? I told you, I’m Swedish. We don’t go to hospitals. We fix things ourselves. Honestly, this is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No! Look, I build engines. I don't need surgeries. You people always want to poke and prod. What are you looking for, exactly? Is there something wrong with me that I haven't noticed? Because if there is, I'm sure it’s from all this… questioning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of serious illness in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family? My mother was… strong. Always working. Never sick a day in her life, as far as I recall. My father… he was a carpenter. Built houses. Solid as a rock. Didn’t go around complaining about… illnesses. Not like some people. As for anything serious... they were both practical people. They didn’t sit around talking about their health. What good would that do? Is this getting somewhere, or are we just wasting time?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. And I take nothing. Why would I? I don’t need anything. I’m a practical man, doctor. I fix things, I don’t… rely on pills and potions. This is… frankly, insulting. Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Because you’re wasting your time. I’m perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but this is a standard pre-enlistment physical. It’s not about finding something wrong, it’s about establishing a baseline. Now, let’s try this. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Good heavens, no! I build engines! What kind of a man do you think I am? Smoke? Maybe a cigar now and then, with the boys, but that’s it. And a small glass of beer… sometimes. When I’ve finished a good day’s work. It helps you relax. But that's it. Don't look at me like that! It's not like I'm a… a degenerate. Are we done yet? This is a complete waste of my time. I have engines to build.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a general overview. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Scale? What for? You’re going to weigh me now? I told you, I’m perfectly fine. I can lift an engine with one hand! A scale won’t tell you anything. But fine, if you must. Just get it over with. This is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: 53 kilograms?
PATIENT: What? 53? That… that can’t be right! The scale must be broken! I told you, I build engines! Heavy things! I’m much… bigger than that. This is… this is preposterous! You have faulty equipment, doctor. I demand another scale! This is a complete insult!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let’s get your height then. Stand against the wall, please. I need to measure you.
PATIENT: Fine! Just… fine. Get it over with. But I'm telling you, this whole thing is a mistake. A complete waste of time. I can feel my back getting worse just standing here. This is probably affecting the reading.
DOCTOR: Okay. 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms… that gives you a BMI of 15.1. That's significantly underweight, Mr. Hartness. Have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I… I haven’t noticed any weight loss! I eat perfectly fine. Maybe I’m just… naturally slim. Some people are built different, you know. I'm Swedish! We have good bones. This is… probably just a miscalculation. Are you trying to tell me I'm sick? Because I'm not sick! I'm perfectly healthy. And I don’t need you to tell me what my body weight should be. I build engines, not… whatever it is you do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but this isn’t about what I think. It’s about objective measurements. A BMI of 15.1 is considered severely underweight and can indicate a number of underlying health concerns. We need to investigate this further. Have you been experiencing any fatigue, weakness, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fatigue? No more than usual. Building engines is hard work, you know! And weakness? What do you expect? I’m not a… a weightlifter! I use my brain, not my muscles. Appetite? I eat when I’m hungry. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends on the day! This is getting ridiculous. You’re trying to find something wrong with me where there isn’t anything! Honestly, I think I’ve had enough of this. I came here for a test, not a… an interrogation. I’m going home. And you can send the army a note saying I’m perfectly capable. They don’t need your numbers. They need someone who can build engines. And that’s me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please. I am concerned about your health. A severely low BMI can lead to serious complications. I strongly recommend we run some blood tests and possibly a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying issues. I understand you’re frustrated, but this isn’t about passing or failing a test. This is about making sure you are healthy and safe. We can't simply ignore these objective findings. I'm going to recommend a referral to a specialist for a full workup. Would you allow me to arrange that for you?
