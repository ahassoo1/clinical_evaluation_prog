DOCTOR: Hi Thyra, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Amussen, good to meet you too. It's just… paperwork, really. I need to get some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare sent me over here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Medicare forms can be… a bit much sometimes. Let me pull up your file here… Okay, Thyra Fabing, age 35. Is there anything specific on the forms you’re having trouble with, or is it more just a general need for a physician signature to confirm your health status for Medicare purposes?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s pretty much it. Just need someone to sign off on things. I don’t really know what they need signed, honestly. I just figured it was easier to come in and have someone look at it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s smart to get it checked out. Let me see… it looks like these are routine forms for continued coverage, just verifying you haven’t had any significant changes in your health. Before I sign, I just want to quickly confirm a few things for my records, standard practice. Have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Yeah, I have been. No big problems, knock on wood. Just the usual aches and pains from work, you know? I’m a control and valve installer, so it can be pretty physical.
DOCTOR: Okay, control and valve installer – that does sound physical! Any specific areas where you’re feeling those aches and pains most, or anything that's gotten worse recently?
PATIENT: Mostly my back, honestly. Lower back. It flares up sometimes, especially after a long day lifting heavy stuff. Nothing I can’t usually manage with some ibuprofen and stretching, though. It hasn't been worse recently, just… always there, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, always there. That’s good to know. And you said ibuprofen helps?
PATIENT: Yeah, it does pretty well. And like I said, stretching helps a lot too. I try to do it every day, but sometimes work gets busy and I skip a day or two. It's nothing crippling, I just don't want it to become something worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s smart to be proactive. Just to get a quick overall picture, have you had any other medical issues in the past - anything diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I broke my arm once, but that healed up fine. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky. No major illnesses or anything. Oh, and I wear glasses, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, broken arm, and glasses – good to know. Any family history of anything significant – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: My grandpa on my mom’s side had diabetes, I think. And my aunt had some kind of cancer, but it was a long time ago, and I don't know what kind. My mom’s pretty healthy, though, and my dad was always really strong… passed away a few years back, but he didn’t have any major health problems that I know of. It’s kinda hard to keep track, you know? We didn't talk about that stuff a lot.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It's not always easy to have those conversations. Okay, and just one more quick thing - are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen when my back flares up, like we talked about. And no, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Pretty boring medical history, huh?
DOCTOR: Not boring at all! It's good to know you're generally healthy. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam just to confirm everything's looking good, and then I'll sign off on your Medicare forms. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll quickly check your range of motion and feel your back. Let me know if anything feels painful. First, can you take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, good. Now I'm going to listen to your lungs. Everything sounds clear so far. Now I’ll listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular and normal. Okay, now let’s check your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. It's a little stiff, but okay. A little pop in my back there, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, I heard a slight pop, which is not uncommon. Now, can you bend backwards a little?
PATIENT: That’s about as far as I can go comfortably. Still a little stiff, but no sharp pain or anything. Feels a little better after moving it around, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling around here… There is some mild tenderness in your lower back, which is consistent with what you've described. No muscle spasms that I can feel. Everything feels normal otherwise. Overall, everything looks good. It sounds like you’re dealing with some typical muscle strain, likely related to your work. I'll go ahead and sign off on your Medicare forms. I’m documenting normal heart and lung sounds, mild tenderness in the lower back, and a history of work-related muscle strain. Do you have any questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. I appreciate you taking the time to check me out, and for signing the forms. It’s a weight off my mind, honestly. I think I'm good.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Thyra. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to listen to your body, stretch regularly, and don't hesitate to come back if things worsen. Here's a handout on proper lifting techniques and back care. I’ll have the front desk send those forms over to Medicare for you. Have a good day! .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Dr. Amussen. You too!
