DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… I’ve been a bit worried about my memory lately. It's just… things aren't sticking like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Memory concerns can be unsettling. Hmm... could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm forgetting everything, you know? It’s more… small things. Like, I went to the grocery store yesterday and totally forgot what I went in for. And then this morning, I couldn't remember if I’d already taken my vitamins. It's just… frequent little blanks. It’s been going on for a few months, I guess. Maybe six? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Six months… alright. Those little slips can be frustrating. And it's good you're noticing them. Just to get a clearer picture, would you say these memory lapses are happening more often recently, or have they been pretty consistent over the last six months?
PATIENT: I think… more recently, yeah. Definitely. It feels like it’s getting a little worse. Like, I used to be able to retrace my steps and figure things out, but now… sometimes I just stare and… nothing. It's a bit scary, honestly. I'm a dentist, you know? I need to remember things!
DOCTOR: A dentist, right, that does require a good memory. That’s definitely understandable that it's concerning you. Okay. Besides forgetting things like grocery lists or vitamins, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My husband… well, he says I repeat myself sometimes. I don't really notice it, but he'll say, "You just told me that five minutes ago!" It’s not a huge thing, but… yeah. And I feel like… I don't know… less interested in things lately. Not sad, exactly, just… blah. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ebony. Repeating yourself, and a general lack of interest... alright. Let's try to get a bit of a broader picture here. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. That’s a good question. Um… I think I'm sleeping okay. Maybe not as deeply as I used to, but I usually get around seven or eight hours. I don't wake up a lot during the night, no. But… I do sometimes feel really tired even after sleeping. It’s weird. Like I didn’t really rest at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, seven to eight hours, but feeling unrefreshed… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty normally, I think. Maybe a little less than usual, just because I haven’t been feeling that hungry lately. But nothing drastic. I still enjoy my food, when I do eat. I wouldn’t say my appetite has changed much at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, thinking a bit about your medical history… have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. And… high blood pressure, I guess. I take medication for it, and it’s pretty well controlled. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else major.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, high blood pressure, gallbladder removal... alright. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Just a multivitamin, I think. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if my back is bothering me. But that’s pretty infrequent. No regular anything else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen... Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty good with medications, actually. Being a dentist, I’ve learned a bit about them! I always check before I take anything new, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and very responsible of you. Okay, just a few more questions then we can move on to a quick physical exam. Thinking about your family... is there anyone in your family with a history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she got… confused a lot towards the end of her life. I don’t know if it was dementia or just old age. And my uncle, he had some sort of neurological condition, but I don’t really know the details. No one really talked about it much. So… maybe? It's hard to say for sure. It wasn't a big topic of conversation in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little bit of a vague family history... that’s good to know. Okay. And lastly, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I mean, I work a lot. Dentist, you know? Long hours, standing on my feet. I try to eat healthy when I can, but it’s hard sometimes with the schedule. I don't exercise as much as I should, I admit. I used to go for walks more often, but… haven't been doing that lately. And I don’t drink or smoke. Pretty normal, I guess. Just busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a pretty good overview. Alright, Ebony, would you mind if I just do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Now, I’m just going to check your pupils and reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And if you could just follow my finger with your eyes… good, good. Everything looks okay so far. Now, I'd like to do a very brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I understand. Just let me know if it's going to be… difficult or anything. I’m a little nervous, I admit.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be nervous, Ebony. It's very simple, I promise. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Um… today is… August 2nd… 2025. Is that right?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect! Yes, August 2nd, 2025. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… um… I… I know this is silly, but… I'm blanking on the city name. It’s on the tip of my tongue! It’s a big city… near the coast… oh dear.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ebony. Take your time. No need to rush. It's a fairly large coastal city... sometimes these things just slip our minds. We can come back to it if you need to. Perhaps we can start with something a little easier. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully, and I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay. Apple, table, penny. I think I have them. It’s just… this feels a little strange.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little strange, Ebony. This is just a standard assessment. Okay, now I’m going to ask you a few simple math questions. What is 5 plus 7?
PATIENT: Um… 5 plus 7… let me see… 12. Is that right?
DOCTOR: That’s correct! Good. Now, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what those three words were?
PATIENT: Um… oh dear. I… I’m really drawing a blank. I know I heard them, but… I just can’t seem to pull them up. I think… was one of them a fruit? Like an apple? I’m not sure…
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Ebony. It's understandable. Based on what we've discussed and the quick assessment, it seems like you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties. Now, I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but these symptoms – the memory lapses, the difficulty recalling words, and the mild confusion – warrant further investigation. I'm going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Um… yes, okay. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best. I just… I want to know what's going on. What could it be? Is it… serious? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ebony, and it’s good that you’re taking this seriously. There are several possibilities that we need to rule out. It could be related to stress, vitamin deficiencies, or even a side effect of medication, but it's important to investigate potential underlying causes. It could be something more serious, like early signs of dementia, but we won't know until we get a proper evaluation from the neurologist. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected neurologist in the area. I’ll have my staff schedule an appointment for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest and maintain a healthy diet. Are there any questions you'd like to ask me before I finalize the referral?
PATIENT: Um… will the neurologist do… brain scans? I’ve seen things on TV… and that’s a bit scary. And… how long does it usually take to get an appointment? I don’t want to wait too long if it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ebony. Dr. Ramirez may order brain scans, such as an MRI or CT scan, depending on her assessment. They're generally non-invasive and provide valuable information, but I understand your apprehension. We can discuss the details with her before any scans are scheduled, and you'll have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. As for the appointment, wait times can vary, but I'm going to mark your referral as urgent, which should help expedite the process. I anticipate you should be able to get an appointment within the next two to three weeks. My staff will keep you updated on the scheduling. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. I'm still worried, but I appreciate you taking it seriously and getting me referred to a specialist. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I understand your anxiety, and I want you to know I’m here to support you throughout this process. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s a pamphlet with some helpful information on cognitive health, and remember, early detection is key. My staff will be in touch to schedule your appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much until we have more information.
