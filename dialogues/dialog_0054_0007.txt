DOCTOR: Good morning, Lakiya. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…a pain. In my back. Been hurting for a while now, and it’s not getting better. I want to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. “A while now” – could you give me a bit more detail?
PATIENT: About…three months, I think. Maybe a little longer. It started after I was helping with the new fence line on Old Man Hemlock’s property. Lots of heavy lifting, digging…that sort of thing. It was alright at first, just a little sore. Now…it just hurts. Constant ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months. And it started with lifting and digging for the fence. That gives us a good starting point. Could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: It’s…deep. Not a sharp pain, more like a…heavy weight. Right across my lower back. It makes it hard to stand for long, and bending over…forget about it. I have to be very careful. It doesn’t really go away, even when I’m sitting. Just…less bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, a deep ache across the lower back that's constant, but less intense when sitting. Does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes. Lifting, definitely. Even small things, sometimes. And twisting. If I try to turn quickly, it feels like something is going to snap. Also…if I’m standing for too long, especially on uneven ground. Like in the fields. That’s the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifting, twisting, and prolonged standing, particularly on uneven surfaces. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Not much, truthfully. Sometimes…lying down flat. But I can’t always lie down, Doctor. I have work to do. A warm bath helps a little, for a short time. But mostly…it’s just there. I take some over-the-counter pain pills, but they don’t do much good anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. So, lying flat and warm baths provide some temporary relief, but the pain persists. You’ve been using over-the-counter pain medication, but it’s not very effective now. Before we move on, have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. My legs feel alright. I can walk okay, though it hurts after a while. No tingling. No numbness. Just…pain. Plain pain.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Lakiya. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any injuries to your back before this fence work?
PATIENT: No. Not that I remember. I’ve always been strong. I’ve had aches and pains from work, like anyone, but never anything like this. I worked on the ranch with my husband for years. Heavy work, but no injuries. He…passed away five years ago. We did everything ourselves. It was hard work, but honest work.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Lakiya. That sounds incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing that. It’s helpful to understand your overall history. Now, aside from your husband’s passing, is there any other significant medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the usual things. High blood pressure, a few years back. They put me on medicine for it, but I don't take it anymore. Doctor said I could try to manage it with my diet. It’s…better now. And I have Medicare, if that matters. No other serious illnesses. I try to stay healthy. I have to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the high blood pressure, and that you're managing it with diet. And yes, Medicare is helpful information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I don't take many medicines, as you can tell. Mostly just the over-the-counter pain pills, and those don't even work anymore. Look, Doctor, can we just get this sorted out? I have a fence to finish.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lakiya. We will. I understand you want to get back to work. Let's get to the physical exam, and then we can discuss some potential options. It won't take long. Could you please lie face down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it’s quick. Hurry it up, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lakiya. I'm just going to feel along your back to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That's where it hurts the most. Not when I’m lying down usually, but when you push…yes. Definitely tender. And a little bit to the left of that, too. That’s where it feels…tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lakiya. Now, I'm going to ask you to gently bend forward as far as you comfortably can. Just let me know when you feel any pain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ouch! That's…not good. It hurts. Right across my lower back, like a heavy weight. I can’t bend over very far. It feels like something is blocking me. And it makes my legs tingle a little when I do that. Not bad, just a little…uncomfortable. Stop, please. I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll stop there, Lakiya. I apologize for any discomfort. The tingling you described is something we need to pay attention to. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or sprain, possibly with some nerve irritation given the tingling in your legs. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Is it necessary? I just want something to help with the pain. I don't want to be messing around with all that…machinery. But…if you think it’s necessary…fine. Just…hurry it up. I have work to do. And can you give me something for the pain now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lakiya. An X-ray will help us rule out any fractures or other structural issues. It’s a precaution, but an important one given the tingling you experienced. And yes, absolutely. Before we get the X-ray, I can prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help with the pain and inflammation. However, please be aware that NSAIDs can sometimes have side effects, so we’ll discuss those with you before you take them. Also, the muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Drowsiness? That’s not good. I can’t be drowsy. I have to work. What kind of side effects? And can I just take the pain pills instead? The ones I already have? This sounds like a lot of trouble for a sore back.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. It's important to be fully informed. The muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and sometimes dry mouth. The NSAID can cause stomach upset, and rarely, more serious issues like ulcers or kidney problems. That’s why it’s important to take it with food and to let me know if you have any history of stomach issues. The pain pills you're currently taking are likely acetaminophen or ibuprofen. They can help with pain, but they don't address the underlying muscle spasm, and they’re not as effective for inflammation. Given the tingling you described, I still strongly recommend the X-ray to rule out anything serious. We can adjust the medication based on your response. If you're very concerned about the drowsiness, we can start with a lower dose of the muscle relaxant. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. A lower dose of the…relaxant. And the X-ray. But you have to promise me it won’t take long. I have fences to build, Doctor. And if it doesn’t help…I’m not coming back.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lakiya. I promise we'll do everything we can to be efficient. I'll write the prescription for a lower dose of the muscle relaxant. The X-ray should only take a few minutes, and our technician will get the results to me as quickly as possible. I'll review them and call you with the results as soon as I can. In the meantime, I recommend applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ice…alright. And no lifting. Easy for you to say. So…I just go get the X-ray now? And then I wait for you to call? Is there anything else? Do I need to do anything special for the X-ray? Like take off my shoes? Or…
DOCTOR: You’ve got it. Yes, just go to the X-ray department – it’s right down the hall, and the receptionist will guide you. You'll likely need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or a belt, but they’ll give you instructions there. You don’t need to do anything special otherwise. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and call you with the plan. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms like weakness or numbness, please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Here’s the prescription and a referral for the X-ray. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just…hurry it up. Thank you. I’ll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Lakiya. You take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
