DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it's... honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to even say. My wife insisted. She’s a worrier, you see. She read something online and now she’s convinced I need to get checked for… that HIV thing. I think it’s a complete waste of time, frankly, but here I am. Just to keep the peace.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you're here, even if it's just to appease your wife. It’s always better to be safe. And honestly, I get it – people read things online, and it can cause unnecessary worry. But dismissing things out of hand isn't the best approach, either. So, let's talk about why your wife is concerned. Has anything specific happened that led her to believe you might be at risk?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Nothing at all. She just… saw a program on TV, I think. About, you know, people getting it. And she gets anxious about everything. We’ve been married fifteen years, same partner the whole time. I haven’t… well, let’s just say I haven’t been a bad husband. It feels like a lot of fuss over nothing. I’ve always taken care of myself. I eat well, I don't do anything reckless. It’s just… silly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fifteen years with the same partner is good to hear. And you're right, that’s a significant factor. Still, even with a long-term, monogamous relationship, it's important to rule things out. We always need to consider all possibilities, even if they seem unlikely. It's part of responsible medical care. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No, never. Not even as a kid. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I mean, a few colds here and there, but nothing serious enough for a hospital visit, let alone a transfusion. I remember being scared of needles as a child, so I avoided anything medical if I could. It's just… I don’t understand why we’re going over all of this when nothing has happened. It feels like a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration. It's annoying to be asked about things that seem irrelevant. But as a doctor, I have a duty to gather all the necessary information. You’re right, a transfusion is unlikely, but we have to cover all the bases. It's about being responsible. Let's talk about your general health a bit more. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I told you, I’m a healthy man. My wife gets me checked out every year, just to humor her. Everything always comes back fine. Blood pressure is good, cholesterol is normal, everything. She worries about my weight, thinks I need to bulk up, but I feel fine the way I am. I’ve always been on the slimmer side. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. She's just making a mountain out of a molehill. Are we going to get to the actual test, or are we just going to keep listing things that haven’t happened?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, I'm not trying to waste your time, Mr. Belan. You’ve made it clear you’re healthy and haven’t engaged in any risky behavior. But your wife brought you in with this concern, and I take all concerns seriously. We can go ahead and order the HIV test, if you insist. But I still think it's important to understand why she's so worried. Has she mentioned anything specific that triggered this?
PATIENT: Honestly, she just keeps saying she "has a feeling." That’s it! A feeling! She watches too much daytime television, I swear. It fills her head with nonsense. She probably saw some story about someone getting it and now she’s convinced I’m next. She’s… dramatic, let’s just say that. I just want to get this over with, prove her wrong, and go home. Yes, please, let’s just do the test. The sooner we get this done, the sooner I can tell her she’s being silly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fine. I’m ordering the HIV test. It’ll be a blood draw, standard procedure. It's a simple finger prick, so no need to worry about a big needle. We’ll also run some other routine blood work while we’re at it – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel just to get a baseline. You never know. Now, while we wait for the results, is there anything else you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I feel perfectly fine. No tiredness, no fever, no… anything. Look, I'm a perfectly healthy man, I told you that already. Is this going to take long? Because I have some errands to run this afternoon. My wife wanted me to pick up some… organic kale. Honestly, the things I do for that woman. Just get it over with, okay? The test, the blood work, whatever. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. We’ll get it done. Nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It won’t take long. Just relax. Before you go, just one last thing, and this is important. Have you noticed any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unexplained weight loss? No! If anything, my wife keeps nagging me to gain weight! I’m perfectly stable. I eat a good, balanced diet. I’m telling you, this is a complete waste of time and frankly, it’s a bit insulting. You're asking me questions like I'm some sort of… invalid. I just want to get this over with. Just… the blood work, okay? And then I can go. I really need to get this kale. She's very particular about it. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I understand your frustration. The nurse will be in shortly. We’ll get the blood work done and you can be on your way with your kale. I’ll have the results sent to your wife’s primary care doctor and a copy sent to you. Just… try to remember that preventative care is important, even when you feel perfectly healthy. And if you do experience any unusual symptoms in the future – weight loss, fatigue, fever, anything at all – don’t hesitate to come back and see me. Even if it seems minor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you. I suppose. I still think this is a complete waste of time, but I’m here. Just… send the results when you can. And please, tell the nurse to be quick. My wife is expecting the kale. Kale… honestly.
