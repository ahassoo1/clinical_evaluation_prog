DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. I’m just…tired. Really tired. And I…well, it’s embarrassing, okay? I keep wanting to eat dirt. Like…clay. Not good dirt, mind you. Just…dirt. It started a few weeks ago, maybe? I don't really keep track of dates. It’s just…a craving. A weird craving.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt. Right. Well, that is unusual. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Maybe longer. Honestly, everything feels the same lately. I just feel…blah. And hungry for…you know. It’s not like I want to eat dirt, it just…feels like I need to. It's stupid. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I'm not here to judge, Ms. Cantoran. Though it is rather atypical. This craving... does it happen at a specific time of day?
PATIENT: Specific time? No. Not that I’ve noticed. It just…hits. Like a wave. Sometimes when I'm cooking, sometimes when I'm watching TV, sometimes just…randomly. I don't know! It's not like I can plan to crave dirt! Honestly, this is ridiculous. I've never heard of anyone else doing this.
DOCTOR: It is uncommon, yes. And frankly, concerning. Have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, my husband died three years ago, okay? Everything’s been a change since then. I work, I eat, I sleep... mostly. I'm tired all the time. Is that a change? I don’t know! I just want to stop wanting to eat…that stuff.
DOCTOR: Three years ago... I see. And you've been feeling fatigued since then?
PATIENT: Well, yeah, mostly. It comes and goes. Some days I can get through work, some days I just…can’t. And this dirt thing started recently. Maybe it’s related? Honestly, I don't know what's related to what anymore. Look, are you going to help me or just ask questions?
DOCTOR: I am trying to help, Ms. Cantoran. But I need information to form an accurate assessment. Let’s try this. Any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain associated with these cravings?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking about my stomach? No, no nausea, no throwing up. Just…a weird taste in my mouth sometimes after. Like…dust. And my stomach feels okay. Maybe a little…off, but I get that sometimes with my work. It’s stressful. Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with eating dirt.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to unusual behaviors, but this is still atypical. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? You want to talk about…that? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, okay? What kind of doctor asks this? And I don't remember if anything's changed! I'm tired, I eat dirt, I go to the bathroom – is that enough? I'm not a medical encyclopedia!
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I am attempting to rule out potential medical causes for this unusual behavior. It's called a differential diagnosis. Now, have you noticed any change—constipation, diarrhea, blood in your stool—anything at all different?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember! Everything is just…a blur lately. I work with computers all day, okay? I program machines. Not…digestive systems! If something was that different, I guess I would've noticed? But I'm constantly tired and craving dirt, so maybe I haven’t noticed other things. Just…leave me alone, okay? This is embarrassing enough.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical exam, then. It's standard procedure. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a grown woman, not a child. I don't need you poking and prodding me to figure out why I'm tired and crave dirt. I'm probably just lacking some vitamin, or something.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there's a slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Not acutely painful, but present. Any history of gallbladder issues?
PATIENT: Gallbladder? No! I don't even know what that is! My mother had something with her stomach once, a long time ago, but I don’t remember the details. Look, I don’t spend my days thinking about my internal organs, okay? I tell machines what to do! I don't have internal organs. Well, I guess I do, but…I don't pay attention to them.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, tenderness in the right upper quadrant can indicate several issues. It warrants further investigation. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. And, Ms. Cantoran, I'm also ordering a stool sample analysis. It’s crucial to rule out any underlying parasitic infection, or mineral deficiencies.
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? Look, can’t you just give me a vitamin pill? Or tell me to eat more vegetables? I don’t want to…examine my stool! This is so embarrassing. Honestly, I’m wasting my time here. Can I just…go?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your discomfort, but dismissing this without proper investigation would be irresponsible. The stool analysis is necessary. As for a vitamin pill… that would be a completely uninformed treatment, and potentially delay a correct diagnosis. I will need you to provide a sample before you leave today. The lab is just down the hall, and they will provide instructions. I'll have the requisitions for all tests printed for you. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. Just…get it over with. I’m going to go fill out these papers and then…go to the bathroom. I guess. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. And embarrassing. And a complete waste of my time. I just wanted someone to tell me why I'm tired and craving dirt, not…analyze my stool. .
DOCTOR: The lab will require a small sample. Please bring the requisition with you. The results will be available in approximately three to five business days. Here are the requisitions and instructions. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave. .
