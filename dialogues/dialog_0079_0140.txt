DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 41 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, good morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s something in my mouth. A white coating. It’s uncomfortable, and my wife insisted I come. She worries too much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. A white coating in the mouth, you say. And it's causing you discomfort. Can you describe the discomfort, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: It's… a burning sensation, mostly. And it makes it hard to eat. Especially anything sweet. Not that I eat much sugar, of course. It just… feels raw. And it looks awful. I don't want my clients to see it. It’s… unprofessional.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about appearance, Mr. Schieber. A burning sensation exacerbated by sweet foods… does this coating cover the entirety of your mouth, or is it localized to specific areas?
PATIENT: Localized. Mostly on my tongue, and the insides of my cheeks. Not… everywhere. And it’s not like it’s peeling or anything. Just… white. Like someone dusted it with flour. Honestly, I don’t see what’s so alarming about it. It’s not like I’m ill, you know? I feel fine otherwise. Just… this. And my wife. She’s a bit of a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you noticed this coating, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know… a week, maybe? Ten days? It came on rather suddenly. I just assumed it was something I ate. I’m always working, always outside… probably just some irritation. I haven't changed my diet. I eat the same things I always do.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you smoke, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I need my lungs for work. Fallers don’t smoke, Doctor. It would be… detrimental to my performance. I’m a professional. I take care of myself. Besides, my wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to take a look inside your mouth, Mr. Schieber, if you don’t mind. Please open wide and say “Ah.”
PATIENT: Really? Is it necessary? It’s… quite invasive, isn't it? But fine, if you insist. Ah…
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There’s a patchy, white coating on your tongue and buccal mucosa. It doesn't appear to be easily scraped off. No obvious lesions or bleeding. Your gums appear healthy, although there is some mild inflammation. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but it could be oral thrush – a fungal infection. However, given your otherwise good health and lack of typical predisposing factors, we should rule out other possibilities. Do you have any allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I know of. I eat everything. I work outside all day, I encounter all sorts of things. Pollen, plants, whatever. Never had a problem. Honestly, Doctor, I think you’re overthinking this. It’s probably just… a bit of irritation. Is that all? Because I really have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, Mr. Schieber. However, it's important to rule out more serious conditions. Given your lack of response to simple remedies, and to be thorough, I'd like to order a simple oral swab to test for fungal infection. It's a quick, painless procedure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A test? Really? Look, I told you, I don't have time for this. Is this absolutely necessary? Can’t you just… prescribe something? An antiseptic mouthwash? Something to get rid of it? I have clients waiting. I don’t want to be fiddling with tests all day. Honestly, this is becoming quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is… not sound medical practice. An antiseptic mouthwash might offer temporary relief, but it won’t address the underlying cause. The swab is a quick, simple way to determine if it is a fungal infection, and guides appropriate treatment. It will take only a few minutes. If you prefer, I can provide a referral to a specialist, but that will likely involve a longer wait time and a more comprehensive examination. We could also consider a different approach, but I strongly advise against simply masking the symptoms without knowing the cause.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do the test. Get it over with. But make it quick, understand? I have a very busy day. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full explanation, and perhaps a discount on the consultation fee. This is really a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. This will only take a moment. We'll send this to the lab, and the results should be back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sugary foods and drinks, and maintaining good oral hygiene. We'll discuss the results and a treatment plan once they're available. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when can I leave? I need to get back to work. And please send me the bill. Hopefully, this won't take too long to resolve. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: The lab results will be sent directly to my office, and my staff will contact you when they're available. You are free to leave now, Mr. Schieber. Here is a form for billing information. I would also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No. None at all. Good day, Doctor. And please, don't bother calling unless it's absolutely necessary.
