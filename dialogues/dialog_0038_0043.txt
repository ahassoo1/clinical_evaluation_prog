DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band squeezin’. Been happenin’ on and off for a couple weeks now, I reckon. Not awful, but… persistent, you know? It just won’t quite go away.
DOCTOR: Right, a persistent headache. I understand. A tight band sensation, you said, at the back of your head. And it's been going on for a couple of weeks now. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn't feel like a throbbing pain, more like… pressure. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m lookin’ at the computer for too long. I do a little financial stuff from home, helpin’ folks with their money. Mostly just spreadsheets and emails, nothin’ too strenuous, I guess. It doesn’t really make me feel sick or anything, no nausea or blurry vision, just… annoying. And it’s worse in the evenings, usually. I try to take some ibuprofen, but it doesn’t always help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of a pressure than a throbbing pain, worse with computer use, and tends to be worse in the evenings. Ibuprofen doesn’t give you much relief. No nausea, no blurry vision – that’s good. Do you notice anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Lyin’ down seems to help a little. And… I don’t know if this matters, but my daughter, she keeps tellin’ me I need to drink more water. She’s probably right, I forget sometimes. I’ve been pretty busy lately, helpin’ her with some things. I don't think anything else makes it noticeably worse, just the computer, really. Oh! And bright lights sometimes bother it a little, but that could just be me gettin’ old, ha!
DOCTOR: Alright, lying down helps, and bright lights bother it a bit. Your daughter's probably right about the water – staying hydrated is important. And you’re helping her out – that’s good. Before we go further, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical problems you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe… thirty years? And I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. The doctor took me off the pills a few years back, said my numbers were lookin’ good. I don’t really see a doctor much otherwise. I try to stay active, walk every day, mostly. And I had some trouble with my shoulder a while back, but that’s healed up pretty good now. Nothing else major, I don’t think. Oh, and I got a bad case of the flu last winter, but who doesn’t, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, previously had high blood pressure but it’s been well-controlled and you’re no longer on medication. Shoulder trouble in the past, flu last winter. That's helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I can take most things without a problem. My wife – bless her soul, she passed a few years back – she was always a little sensitive to penicillin, but I ain't. I’ve never had to worry about allergies myself, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Okay, so no known allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications, is that correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No medications at all. Just tryin’ to keep myself goin’, you know? Doctor, you think this headache is somethin’ to worry about? It’s just… been botherin’ me long enough now that I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It’s always best to get these things looked at. Alright, Mr. Gibbel, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological exam, just to make sure everything is working as it should. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain’t afraid of a little checkin’. I always figured a good doctor was worth listenin' to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gibbel, everything seems normal so far. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so, and your neurological exam is perfectly fine. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache. These are very common, often brought on by stress, computer use, or dehydration. The fact that lying down helps and ibuprofen doesn't fully relieve it also points in that direction. However, because your blood pressure is a little high, and because the headache has been persistent, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests just to rule out anything else. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. If checkin’ my blood will make sure nothin’ else is goin’ on, then I’m all for it. I don't want any surprises, you know? I'm glad you're bein’ thorough. What kind of blood tests are we talkin’ about? Just curious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'd like to do a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to look at your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. These are all fairly routine tests, and will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health. While we’re waiting for those results, I recommend a few things. First, really focus on staying hydrated – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. Second, try to take frequent breaks from the computer – every 20 minutes, look away at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds – it’s called the 20-20-20 rule. And third, try some relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises or gentle stretching. Do you think you can manage those things?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can definitely try all that. Eight glasses of water… my daughter’s gonna be happy to hear me say that. The 20-20-20 rule sounds easy enough. Relaxation… well, I used to enjoy fishin’, maybe I should get back to that. Sounds like a good plan, Doctor. When will I get the results back? And how do we go about gettin’ these blood tests done? Do I need to schedule somethin’ here, or…?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Fishing is a great stress reliever – definitely a good idea! The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples right here in the clinic before you leave today. She'll give you some instructions on fasting, if any is required – though these tests don't usually need a strict fast. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if the headache worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly. I appreciate you bein’ so thorough. I feel a lot better knowin’ we’re checkin’ things out. Alright, let's get this blood drawn then, shall we?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. Don't hesitate to ask her if you have any questions during the process. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Mr. Gibbel’s blood?
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
