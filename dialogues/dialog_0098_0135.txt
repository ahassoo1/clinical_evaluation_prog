DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I am here because… my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of liquid comes out. It started, I think, three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from the ear for about three days now. Hmm. Can you describe the liquid for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It is… not thick. Like water, but… maybe a little bit yellow. And sometimes, a small… piece. A very small piece, like skin. It does not hurt, but it is… uncomfortable. It feels full.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery, slightly yellow discharge, and occasionally small pieces of skin. You said it doesn’t hurt, just uncomfortable and feels full. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. The right ear is… normal. I clean it with a cloth, but it keeps coming back. Not a lot, but enough to notice. I am worried it is… something bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. It's good you're paying attention to it. Have you noticed any other symptoms with your ear, like any ringing, hearing loss, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No ringing, Doctor. My hearing… it seems okay. Maybe a little quiet, but I am old. Perhaps that is just… getting older. And no dizziness. I walk steady. It is only the liquid. And the… full feeling. It makes me… not want to put anything in my ear. It is sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no ringing, hearing seems stable, no dizziness, and sensitivity in the left ear. Have you had any ear problems before – infections, pain, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had… an earache. Very bad. A doctor gave me drops. It went away. But this… this is different. This is not pain. It is… wet. And the little pieces. I do not remember anything like this before. It was many years ago, though. Perhaps I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past ear infection as a young man, treated with drops. And this feels different – more of a discharge than pain. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No diabetes, Doctor. The doctor checks me every year. And my blood pressure… sometimes it is high, sometimes it is normal. I take a pill for it. A white pill. I do not remember the name. But the doctor says it is okay. It is controlled. I see him in March.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never. I eat many things. Fruits, meats, spices… everything. I have no trouble. My wife, she is allergic to cats. But I am fine. No problems with allergies. I am very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, before we take a look at your ear, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: I try to stay active, Doctor. I walk every day. Not far, but enough. I eat… okay. My daughter, she cooks for me sometimes. I live alone now, since the divorce. But I am… not sick. Just old. And this ear. I worry about this ear. It is… bothersome. And I do not want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take a look and see what's going on. Let me just grab my otoscope… Okay, if you could sit forward just a bit, I'm going to take a look in your ear. It won’t take long, and I’ll let you know what I see. I may need to gently pull on your earlobe to get a better view. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is alright. You may pull. Gently, please. I am a little sensitive. And I will sit forward. I want to know what is happening. This ear… it worries me. I trust you. Please tell me if it is something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some earwax and the discharge you described. Your eardrum looks a little cloudy, but doesn’t appear to be ruptured. There’s no sign of any active infection at this moment, but it is definitely irritated. It looks like you may have some mild otitis externa – inflammation of the ear canal, sometimes called swimmer’s ear, although you don't necessarily need to swim to get it. It’s likely the irritation is causing the discharge and the full feeling. We can treat it with some ear drops, a topical steroid and antibiotic combination. But before that, I want to get a sample of the discharge to send off to the lab. It's just to confirm what's causing it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ear drops… and a sample? Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. If it will help, then I will do it. A sample… how do you get it? It does not hurt, does it? I am a little worried about that. This ear… it is very sensitive. I want to know what is causing it. The ear drops… will they help the full feeling? And the… leaking?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt at all, Mr. Radillo. I’ll just gently swab the inside of your ear canal. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. And yes, the ear drops should help with both the full feeling and the leaking. They’ll reduce the inflammation and help to clear up any potential infection. Alright, I’ve got the sample. I'll send this off to the lab, and it should take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for some ear drops. It's a combination of a steroid to reduce the inflammation and an antibiotic just in case there is a mild infection. I'll also give you instructions on how to use them properly. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A few days… for the results. Okay. And the instructions… are they easy to understand? I am not very good with… complicated things. And the ear drops… do I need to warm them up? My daughter, she says you have to warm up some drops. I do not want to do anything wrong. And… will I feel better quickly? I have a meeting next week, and I need to be clear. This ear… it is important.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Radillo. The instructions are very simple, I promise. And no, you do not need to warm up these drops. In fact, you shouldn't. Use them at room temperature. Warming them could actually cause a problem. Here you go. It says to lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Put two to three drops in your ear and gently wiggle your ear. Stay lying on that side for about five minutes to let the drops soak in. Do this twice a day for seven days. As for feeling better, you should start to notice an improvement within a couple of days. It may take the full seven days to clear it up completely, but it shouldn’t get any worse if you use the drops as directed. If it does get worse, or if you develop any pain, fever, or dizziness, call the office right away. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… room temperature. Not warm. Two or three drops, wiggle ear, five minutes, twice a day, seven days. And call if it gets worse, or pain, or fever, or dizziness. I think… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You explain it very well. This ear… I hope it gets better quickly. I have a meeting. It is important. And… the results. A few days. I will wait. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. And yes, I’m optimistic you’ll start to feel better soon. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to check on your progress. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered all my questions. Thank you for your time. And for being so… patient. This ear… it worried me a lot. I feel much better now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could ease your worries. Get well soon, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
