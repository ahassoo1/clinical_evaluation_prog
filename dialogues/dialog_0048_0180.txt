DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… tiredness. Just really, really tired. And… well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I crave it. Like, I need it. Don't look at me like that. It's stupid.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… Right. Well, it’s not necessarily stupid, Ms. Cantoran, though it’s… unusual. How long has this tiredness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know. Months, I guess? Everything just feels… heavy. Like wading through mud. And the dirt… started around the same time, maybe? I don't keep track of these things. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. It's hard to get anything done when you can barely keep your eyes open.
DOCTOR: Months of fatigue… and the dirt-eating coincides. Do you find yourself craving specific types of dirt?
PATIENT: Specific? What does that even mean? It's dirt! From the yard, mostly. Sometimes I… find some good stuff when I'm walking. Don't judge me. It just… tastes right. I don't know how to explain it. And it makes the tiredness a little better, for a bit. A little.
DOCTOR: Right. "Good stuff when walking." Ms. Cantoran, have you noticed any other changes alongside the fatigue and this… craving?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what? I… I dunno. My stomach's been a bit off, maybe? But I eat anything, honestly. I'm not a picky eater. Used to be able to work all day, build programs, now I can barely sit up straight. Is that a change? Everything's a change when you feel like garbage.
DOCTOR: Stomach issues… Alright. And how about… any dizziness, headaches, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath, yeah, sometimes. Especially when I'm walking uphill. I live on a bit of a slope, so that's… not ideal. Headaches are pretty regular, too. Dull ones, mostly. Like a weight on my head. It's all just… unpleasant. Look, can we get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… hurry. I really don't like doctors. Too much poking and prodding. This is just… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are… regular, though a bit faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Abdomen is soft, but… slightly tender in the lower quadrants. I’m also noting some pallor. Let me check your extremities. Your pulse is a little weak, and your nails appear… brittle.
PATIENT: Brittle? They always have been brittle. I work with computers, not manicures! Look, is something seriously wrong, or can I just go home and take a nap? This is… unsettling. I don't do well with unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, your symptoms – fatigue, dirt-eating, stomach issues, pallor, brittle nails, and a weak pulse – are concerning. It's possible you're anemic. The dirt-eating, known as pica, can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, often iron. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. I also want to check your vitamin levels, specifically B12 and Folate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. More poking and prodding. Fine, whatever. Just… tell me what I have to do. And how long will this take? I don’t want to be stuck here all day.
DOCTOR: You’ll need to go to the lab – it's across the street. They'll draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take more than an hour, including the wait. I’ll have the results sent to me, and I’ll call you with a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid eating dirt, as it could be exacerbating the problem. And… try to get some rest. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Avoid eating dirt? Easy for you to say. Look, I'll try. But don't look at me like I'm a child. It's… difficult. And no, I don’t have any questions. Just… tell me when to come back.
DOCTOR: The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe shortness of breath or dizziness. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. "Other patients to see…" As if my time isn't valuable. .
