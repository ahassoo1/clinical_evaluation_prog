DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin, you see. It’s gotten rather… yellow. Not a good yellow, if you understand. My… friend, she noticed it first, and insisted I come. Something about my… liver, I believe? I don't recall all the details. It’s been a bit troubling, frankly, and I'd like to get it sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yellow skin… right. Okay. And how long have you noticed this yellowing, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Time… it slips away, doesn't it? Let me think… perhaps… a month? Maybe six weeks? It started subtly, I suppose. I didn’t pay it much mind at first, thought it was just the light. But it’s become more noticeable. It's… worrisome. Do you need a precise date? I’m afraid I’m not very good with remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: No, a month or six weeks is fine. It's okay, don't worry about precision. Has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I’ve been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And… my appetite hasn’t been the best. Everything tastes… bland, you see. Not unpleasant, just… lacking. It’s difficult to explain. And, sometimes, a little ache under my ribs… on the right side, I think. It comes and goes, nothing terribly severe. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, loss of appetite, and an ache under the right ribs... Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your… bowel movements, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… rather a personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. They’ve been… paler, I believe. And… not as frequent. I hadn't thought it important enough to mention, truthfully. It just… seemed like part of getting older. But you’re the doctor, so… I suppose everything is relevant. Is that a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned it. Not necessarily a bad sign, but important information. Now, have you had any itching, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Itching? Sometimes, yes. Not all over, mind you. Mostly on my… palms and soles of my feet. A little irritating, but nothing unbearable. I just assumed it was dry skin, honestly. The weather has been quite… unpredictable, you see. Is this all connected to the… yellowing? It’s rather alarming to think about, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Durig, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and take a look at your skin more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement completely. I just… I’d like this to be over with quickly, if you don’t mind. It’s not that I’m afraid, precisely, but… my nerves aren’t what they used to be. Do let me know if you discover anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little… yes, right there. It’s not sharp, more of a… dull ache. Like a heavy feeling. It’s not constant, mind you, it comes and goes. But yes, that is… uncomfortable. Is that… significant? I do hope it's nothing too serious. This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your skin does appear jaundiced, as your friend noted. And I do notice some slight swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it's important we investigate the cause of this jaundice. I suspect it could be a problem with your liver or gallbladder, or potentially something affecting your red blood cells. We'll need some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Yes, I suppose so. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but… I understand it’s necessary. Are they… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a… a luncheon scheduled next week, and I would hate to miss it. It’s with my… well, never mind. Just, how long, Doctor? And will it be very disruptive? This is all so very… complicated.
DOCTOR: The blood draw itself is usually just a quick pinch, Ms. Durig. It shouldn’t be too disruptive. As for the results, it typically takes a few days, maybe three to five business days, to get everything back from the lab. We’ll call you with the findings as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and a bilirubin test. These will give us a good starting point. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sufficient. A complete blood count, liver function panel, and bilirubin test… I shall try to remember that. Three to five business days… I will mark it on my calendar. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Hopefully, it won’t be anything too serious. Is there anything I should do now? Any restrictions I should follow before the tests? I don't want to complicate things further. .
DOCTOR: For now, just try to rest and maintain a normal diet. Avoid alcohol, as that can affect liver function. We'll discuss the results when we get them and determine the next steps. I'll have my nurse draw the blood before you leave. Any questions for me before we wrap up?
