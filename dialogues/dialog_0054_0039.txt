DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the lab… said my cholesterol was a bit high. Didn't really understand all the numbers, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, said I ought to come get it checked out. She worries so.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to get this looked at – it's always wise to follow up on things like that. And you’re right, those lab reports can be confusing. Okay, I see your recent cholesterol panel here. We can definitely go over those numbers together and figure out what they mean. Before we dive into the results, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I reckon I'm pretty healthy for my age. I still get out and do a bit of gardening, mostly. Can't do as much heavy lifting as I used to, but I manage. Used to be a real strong fella, you know. Worked with the… protective services, mostly. Helping folks. Been retired for a good while now. Lost my wife, Martha, about ten years back. Just me and the cat these days.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like you've lived a full and meaningful life, and staying active with the gardening is wonderful. That’s all very helpful. Now, in terms of your medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. Never had much trouble with my heart, knock on wood. Blood pressure… the doctor checked it every now and then when I was working, but I don't recall it ever being a problem. I've always been pretty lean, you see. Mostly just ate what Martha cooked – good, wholesome food. Not much for sweets, though. Always preferred a savory dish.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it sounds like you had a wonderful partner in Martha. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… now. When I was a young man, maybe twenty-two, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Silly thing, chasing a kite. They set it at the hospital, of course. Other than that… no, I can't recall ever being in the hospital. Nothing serious ever, thankfully. A few colds here and there, but nothing a good rest and some chicken soup couldn’t fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Just a broken arm as a young man, otherwise no significant surgical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir, not a one. I don't believe in loading up on pills if I can avoid it. Always figured a good diet and a bit of exercise was the best medicine. I take a little calcium now and then, my daughter gives me some… says it's good for my bones. But that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the calcium supplement your daughter provides. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. My wife used to say I could eat anything, and I mostly did! Though, I don’t much care for oysters. But that’s just a matter of taste, not an allergy, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Bohnett, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father, he had a bit of trouble with his heart when he got older. Didn't take care of himself, always smoked a pipe. And my mother, she had… well, she had some trouble with her sugar when she got on in years. Not sure what they called it back then, but it sounded like diabetes. And my sister, bless her soul, she passed away from cancer a few years back. Lung cancer, I think it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. History of heart disease in your father, diabetes in your mother, and lung cancer in your sister. Now, I understand you recently had a cholesterol test that prompted you to come in. Have you been experiencing any symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a bit. That's what surprised me about the letter. I feel right as rain, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but that's just old age creeping up on me, I reckon. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I was out in the garden yesterday, weeding the tomatoes, and felt fine.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring to hear. No concerning symptoms. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, let's take a look at those cholesterol numbers now. Your total cholesterol is 240 mg/dL. Your LDL, which is the "bad" cholesterol, is 160 mg/dL. Your HDL, the "good" cholesterol, is 40 mg/dL. And your triglycerides are 150 mg/dL. Now, these numbers are a little higher than we'd like to see. An LDL over 100 is generally considered elevated, and yours is a bit higher than that. Do you have any questions about these numbers so far?
PATIENT: Whoa. Those numbers… they don’t mean much to me, Doctor. You said “bad” and “good” cholesterol… is that the important part? And what does “elevated” mean? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. It is a lot of information. Think of cholesterol like fat in your blood. We need some cholesterol for our bodies to work, but too much of the "bad" kind – the LDL – can build up in your arteries and make them narrow. That can lead to heart problems over time. The "good" cholesterol – HDL – helps remove the bad cholesterol from your arteries. So, we want that number to be higher. Your LDL is a bit high at 160, and your HDL is a little low at 40. Your triglycerides are okay, but also on the higher side. "Elevated" just means they're higher than the ideal range. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in immediate danger, but it does mean we need to take steps to lower them. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… so, the bad stuff is too high, and the good stuff is too low. Like a seesaw, almost. And it can make things narrow inside me… that sounds… not good. What sort of “steps” are we talkin’ about, Doctor? Do I need… pills? I really don’t like the idea of taking a bunch of pills every day.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right – like a seesaw! And yes, narrowing inside you isn't ideal, that's what we want to prevent. Now, about the steps we can take. Luckily, there are often things we can do before considering medication. The first things we'll focus on are lifestyle changes. This includes diet and exercise. We can talk about reducing saturated and trans fats in your diet, increasing fiber, and getting regular physical activity. Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. We can also discuss quitting smoking, if you happen to smoke, and limiting alcohol consumption. We'll start with these changes and see how your numbers respond. We'll repeat the cholesterol test in about three months to see if they’ve improved. If they haven’t, then we can discuss medication options. But let's try the lifestyle changes first, okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I don’t smoke, thank goodness. Martha always hated it. And I don’t drink much, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. The walking and the diet… I can do that. I enjoy my garden, that’s good exercise, isn't it? And I reckon I can cut back on the fried foods, my daughter always tells me I eat too much of them. So, no pills right away? Just… try to be better?
DOCTOR: Exactly! No pills right away. Just try to be better. Gardening is excellent exercise, absolutely. It’s a great way to stay active and enjoy the outdoors. And cutting back on fried foods is a great start. We can talk about specific dietary recommendations, like incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. I can also give you a handout with some helpful tips for heart-healthy eating. Before we finish up, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. A quick check-up can’t hurt. I always figured I was a pretty sturdy fella, but you can never be too careful, I suppose. And I appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly. It's easy to get lost in all the numbers and medical talk.
DOCTOR: That’s my job, Mr. Bohnett – to make sure you understand everything. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. … 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not too concerning given your anxiety about the cholesterol results. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything sounds good, Mr. Bohnett. As I said, everything's within normal limits. We'll focus on those lifestyle changes, repeat the cholesterol test in three months, and see how things are progressing. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Lifestyle changes… I can do that. I’ll start walking more and eat a bit better. And I’ll make sure to tell my daughter I’m takin’ care of things. She’ll be relieved. Thank you for your time, Doctor Dashevsky. You’re a good man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll see you back in three months for a follow-up cholesterol test. Here’s a handout with some information on heart-healthy eating and exercise. Have a good day, and take care of yourself!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And I will!
