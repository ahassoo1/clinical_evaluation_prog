DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my ears, I think. They’ve been playing up a bit. And I get dizzy sometimes, real sudden-like. It’s hard to explain, honestly. My daughter, she booked the appointment for me. She was worried. I don't remember all the details myself, but it’s been happening on and off.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and dizziness. On and off, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not all the time, thankfully. It just… comes and goes. Sometimes I hear a ringing, too. A sort of… whooshing sound, mostly. It’s unsettling. And the dizziness… well, it feels like the room is spinning, you know? It doesn’t last long, but it’s enough to scare me.
DOCTOR: Ringing and dizziness… alright. And when did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. It’s been… a while now. A few months, maybe? Longer? It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter said something about it starting after a bad cold, but I don’t quite recall.
DOCTOR: A few months, possibly after a cold… Okay. And has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggered…? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, no. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything in particular. I’ve tried to think about it, but it just… happens. Sometimes when I’m resting, sometimes when I’m up and about. It’s very random, I’m afraid. My family… my husband, he had some trouble with his balance towards the end… could be something like that, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright. Random episodes… and a family history of balance issues. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… sometimes I feel a bit off-balance even between episodes, just a little unsteady on my feet. And I’ve been feeling a bit more tired lately, but that could just be my age, I suppose. Oh, and I get headaches sometimes, but I get those anyway. Nothing… nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, occasional headaches, and a sense of unsteadiness. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so… I see a doctor regularly. I’ve got a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. And I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Oh, and high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. That’s about it, I think. It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, gallbladder removal, and managed hypertension. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking something I really can’t recall. I just… take the pills the doctor gives me. They’re little white ones, I think? And a pink one sometimes. I have my daughter help me with the timings, to be honest. I’m sorry, I really don’t know the names.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to clarify those medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me when I go to the doctor, and I always say no. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would. Okay. Now, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears and do a brief balance test, if that's alright with you. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. I’m not a fan of things in my ears, but… if it helps, then go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lean back for me. And I may ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Hmm… there’s a little bit of wax in both ears, but nothing significant. The ear canals themselves look normal. Now, let’s check your balance. Okay, stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. A little unsteady, but not dramatically so. Your gait seems relatively normal, but there's a slight hesitation.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know, I suppose. I do feel a bit clumsy sometimes. My daughter says I walk like an old woman, but I tell her she’s exaggerating. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I'm a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Ms. Mayhugh. The examination doesn’t point to anything immediately alarming, but your symptoms – the dizziness, ringing, and unsteadiness – warrant further investigation. The wax could be contributing, so we can start by removing that. But given your history and symptoms, I’d like to order a hearing test, just to rule out any inner ear problems. And perhaps an MRI of the brain, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI… that sounds… complicated. And a bit scary. But… if it helps, then yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. I don't want to be a bother, though. Is it a lot of trouble?
DOCTOR: It’s not a bother at all, Ms. Mayhugh. And an MRI is a very safe procedure. It's just a scan, no needles or anything like that. It will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll get those tests scheduled for you. In the meantime, let’s get that wax removed. We can also start a diary of your symptoms, noting when the dizziness occurs and what, if anything, seems to trigger it. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, a diary sounds alright. I can do that. My daughter can help me with it, too. She’s very good at remembering things. I just… I hope it’s not something too serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. We'll take things one step at a time. Let's start with the wax removal and the tests, and then we'll discuss the results and create a plan. I'll have my nurse schedule those for you right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just… thank you. I feel a bit better knowing we’re doing something about it. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I’ll have the nurse come in to discuss the next steps. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
PATIENT: .
