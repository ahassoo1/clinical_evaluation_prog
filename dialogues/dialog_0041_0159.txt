DOCTOR: Hi Elijiah, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hey, Dr. Polczynski, nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s kinda weird to explain. I’m just… having a hard time getting out of chairs. Like, I sit down, and then it’s just… effort. Not pain, exactly, just… stuck. It started a few weeks back, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm, interesting. "Stuck," you say. Not pain, just… difficulty initiating movement when you try to stand up from a seated position?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Initiating is the right word. It feels like my legs… don’t wanna listen right away. Like there's a delay between my brain telling ‘em to go and them actually going. It’s happened with all sorts of chairs, too. My kitchen chair, a bench at work… even a nice comfy one at a friend's place. It's just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long would you say this “delay” is, roughly?
PATIENT: It's not a long time, like, not minutes or anything. Maybe… a few seconds? Enough to feel kinda awkward, like I'm waiting for something to happen. Sometimes I gotta kinda… rock a little to get going, or push with my arms on the chair. It doesn’t happen every time I stand up, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few seconds of difficulty, requiring some effort to initiate standing. And it’s been going on for a few weeks. Do you notice it's worse after sitting for a longer period, or does it not seem to matter how long you’ve been sitting?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I think it is worse the longer I’m sitting. Like, if I just stand up after a minute or so, it's not so bad. But if I'm, say, relaxing watching TV for an hour, it's definitely harder to get up. Feels like my legs are… stiffer, I guess. Then I gotta really concentrate on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Stiffness with prolonged sitting, difficulty initiating movement. Now, let’s talk a little bit more generally. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No pain anywhere else, no weakness, no numbness or tingling. My balance feels okay, I haven't fallen or anything. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but honestly, that could just be the job. It’s pretty rough work, you know? Lots of long days.
DOCTOR: Right, the job. We can circle back to that. No pain, weakness, or numbness – good. Just the fatigue and the difficulty getting up. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Nah, my appetite’s pretty normal, I think. Maybe a little less when I'm really tired, but I haven’t been losing or gaining any weight. I’m pretty steady, I guess. I haven’t been tracking it or anything, but my clothes still fit the same.
DOCTOR: Okay. No changes in appetite or weight. And just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or any recent illnesses or infections?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Haven't been sick or anything like that for… honestly, I can't remember the last time I was sick. Just the usual little colds, but nothing major. Definitely haven't had anything serious. It's hard to get time off work to even go to the doctor when you're feeling bad, you know? So I usually just try to push through.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Pushing through can sometimes make things worse. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like arthritis, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been to a doctor regularly, to be honest. Just for work check-ups, you know, to make sure I’m fit enough to do the job. They never found anything. My wife… she took care of all that kinda stuff. She passed away a few years back, so… I haven't really kept up with it. I didn’t need to, I guess. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s alright if you don’t have a detailed medical history readily available. We’ll work through it. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Thanks, Dr. Polczynski. It was… a while ago now. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve broken a few bones here and there working, but nothing serious enough to need a hospital. Just a cast and some time off. Mostly sprains and bruises, that kinda thing. Nothing that left any lasting problems, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any medical conditions, like arthritis, muscle problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My wife, again, she always kept track of that kinda thing. My parents… they both passed away when I was pretty young. And I didn’t really know my grandparents. I grew up kinda… on my own, mostly. I don’t know anything about their medical history, to be honest. I wish I did. It would be good to know, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: It would be. We can't change the past, but we can focus on what we do know. Alright. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never really been interested. I work long hours, and when I'm not working, I'm usually pretty tired. I mostly just try to get enough sleep and eat something decent. My wife didn’t drink or smoke either, so it just wasn’t really part of our life. I don’t really see the point, to be honest. It just seems like it would make things harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken some over-the-counter stuff for headaches and colds, but never had any reactions. I can take penicillin without any problems, as far as I know. My wife always double-checked before giving me anything, but I haven’t needed to worry about it much since… well, since she’s been gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to just tough it out, if I can. I figure, the less I put into my body, the better. My wife used to worry about me doing that, though. She always said I was too stubborn.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're a very resilient person. Alright. So, to summarize: you're a 26-year-old male experiencing difficulty initiating standing from a seated position, worse with prolonged sitting. No pain, weakness, numbness, or fever. No known medical conditions, surgeries, or hospitalizations. No family history available. No allergies or current medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your strength, reflexes, and range of motion, just to get a better idea of what's going on. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just wanna figure out what's going on with my legs. It’s just… kinda unsettling, you know? Not being able to just stand up. Go ahead, Doc. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. After that, I’ll have you sit and stand a few times so I can observe how you get up. Finally, I’ll assess your muscle strength in your legs. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable during the exam. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your reflexes are normal. Now, can you please sit down in this chair for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. This chair’s pretty comfy, actually. Feels kinda weird, thinking about how hard it was to get up from some of the others. I'll just sit here and wait for you to tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, now I'd like you to stand up and sit back down a few times, at your own pace. I'm just watching your movement to see how you do it. Don't worry if it feels a little awkward, just do what feels natural. Okay, I see a bit of hesitation when initiating the movement and you are using your arms for assistance. There’s some rocking to help get you started. No visible signs of pain, which is good. Now, can you please try standing up without using your arms for assistance, if you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I'll try. It's harder without using my arms, for sure. Whoa. That's… definitely harder. It feels kinda unstable. Like I’m gonna fall forward. I need to really concentrate to keep my balance. It’s not painful, just… a lot of effort. It’s like my legs are slow to react.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. It requires significant effort and concentration, and there's some instability. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength in your legs. I'm going to ask you to push against my hand, and I'll rate your strength on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being normal strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. I'll try my best. I work with my hands all day, so they’re pretty strong. My legs… well, we’ll see. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your quadriceps strength. Please sit with your legs dangling, and try to straighten your right leg against my resistance. Don't push yourself too hard. Okay, that's good. Both legs are 4/5 strength. Now, I’m going to check your hamstring strength. Lean forward slightly, and try to bend your right leg against my resistance. Okay, your hamstrings are also 4/5 strength. Now, can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here goes. There. How was that? It doesn’t feel natural, you know? Like I’m thinking about each step too much. It's not painful, just… awkward. It feels like I'm having to consciously tell my legs what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. Your gait is slightly stiff and cautious. Now, based on what I’ve observed during the exam and your history, it appears you may be experiencing something called proximal weakness. This means the muscles closest to your core – in this case, your hips and thighs – are having some difficulty initiating movement. The 4/5 strength indicates there is strength there, but it's not as readily available as it should be. It’s good that there is no pain, which rules out some more serious conditions. Now, this could be caused by a number of things, ranging from a simple lack of regular exercise to a vitamin deficiency, or potentially something neurological. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I recommend we order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also think it would be helpful to get an imaging scan of your hips and lower back to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a scan… okay. Sounds… thorough. I haven’t had much luck with doctors in the past, to be honest. They usually just tell me to rest and take some ibuprofen. But you seem to be taking it seriously, which I appreciate. Yeah, let’s do the tests and the scan. I just want to figure out what's going on. I don't want this to get worse. I need to be able to do my job. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It’s good to find a doctor you trust, and I assure you, I’m taking your concerns seriously. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Okay, first, I’ll have my nurse draw some blood for a complete blood count, vitamin D levels, vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel. Then, we’ll schedule you for an MRI of your lower back and hips. The MRI will give us a detailed look at the muscles, bones, and nerves in that area. The nurse will give you specific instructions on how to prepare for the MRI, as you’ll need to avoid certain things beforehand. In the meantime, it’s important to stay active, within your limits. Avoid strenuous activities that make your symptoms worse, but try to do some gentle exercises, like walking or stretching, to keep your muscles engaged. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Blood tests, MRI, gentle exercise, and call if things get worse. I can remember that. Uh, one quick question: how long does it usually take to get the results back from the blood tests and the MRI? I don’t wanna be waiting around for weeks. I need to know what’s going on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. Typically, the blood test results come back within 2-3 business days. The MRI results usually take a little longer, about 5-7 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once I have all the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan. We can also prioritize the MRI if you’re particularly concerned, though it might mean a slightly longer wait time for the appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience any pain, weakness, numbness, or difficulty walking – please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. It's a lot, but I appreciate you explaining it all so clearly. I’ll just try to stay active, avoid anything strenuous, and wait for the results. Thanks, Dr. Polczynski. I really appreciate your help. I’ll let the nurse know I’m ready for the blood tests when she's ready.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Elijiah. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. You take care, and I’ll see you soon.
