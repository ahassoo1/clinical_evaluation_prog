DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. A liquid. It started, maybe, two days ago?
DOCTOR: Two days ago, alright. And which ear is it, specifically?
PATIENT: The right ear, Doctor. It is… uncomfortable, yes? Not pain, exactly. More like… full. And the liquid is… clear. Mostly clear. Sometimes a little bit… yellow.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Clear or slightly yellow discharge from the right ear, started two days ago with a feeling of fullness… Have you experienced any hearing loss, ringing in your ear, or dizziness alongside this?
PATIENT: No dizziness, Doctor. No. My hearing… perhaps a little quiet in that ear, yes? But not much. It is… difficult to explain. Things sound… muffled, maybe. Like speaking with cloth in my ear. Not a lot less sound, you understand? Just… not as sharp. No ringing, though. Never ringing.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, no ringing… Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or any pain anywhere else – headache, sore throat, tooth pain, anything like that?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. No chills. No headache, no sore throat. My teeth are… fine. I had a check-up with the dentist last month. Everything was good. Just this ear. This is… strange. I have not had this before.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any injury to your ear recently?
PATIENT: No injury, Doctor. I… I am careful. I do not swim, and I do not put anything in my ear. No cotton swabs. My wife… she always tells me not to put things in my ear. She is very… insistent. So, no, no injury. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injury, no foreign objects... And have you had any ear infections previously, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was a boy, I think. In Somalia. I was very small. I remember… a lot of pain. And the doctor… he put drops in my ear. But… it was a long time ago. I do not remember much else. Many years. Perhaps 40 years? More?
DOCTOR: Alright, history of ear infection as a child. I see. And are you currently taking any medications for anything, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing. And no allergies, no. I eat everything. Fish, meat, vegetables… everything. My wife, she has allergies, but I do not. Never had a problem with allergies. No swelling, no itching, no trouble breathing… nothing.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's have a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope, it has a light on it so I can see inside. It won't hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable. Please lean forward a little.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will lean forward. I hope it is not… too bad. I do not like things near my ear, you understand? But I trust you. Please be careful. I will try to be very still.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes… I see some fluid in the middle ear space, and the eardrum appears slightly…buldging. There’s some debris visible as well. It appears there is some inflammation present. It looks like you have a middle ear effusion, likely secondary to an infection – possibly acute otitis media, though without fever it’s a bit less certain. I’m also going to check your tympanic membrane mobility. This is to see how well your eardrum moves.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I feel the puff of air, yes? It is… strange. Like something moving inside. Is this… normal? It does not hurt, but it is… peculiar. It feels… blocked, even more now. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I need to teach my students tomorrow. Will this affect my hearing then?
DOCTOR: The reduced mobility confirms my suspicion. It's not moving as freely as it should. It suggests fluid build-up is preventing it from vibrating properly. Given your history of childhood ear infections, and the current presentation, it’s most likely acute otitis media, despite the absence of fever. It’s not immediately serious in the sense that it’s life-threatening, but it can be quite uncomfortable, and can cause temporary hearing loss, as you’ve noted. Your hearing may be slightly affected tomorrow, but it shouldn't be debilitating. To be certain, and to address the infection, I’m going to prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics. Amoxicillin should do the trick. We'll also use a decongestant to help drain the fluid. I’ll also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. Are you allergic to penicillin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergy to penicillin. My wife… she takes penicillin sometimes for her… I don't know what she calls it. Something with her nose. But I have never had a problem. So, Amoxicillin is… okay. Will this make me feel… sick? I do not want to be sick. And the decongestant... will that help the ear? How long will I need to take these medicines?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No penicillin allergy. Amoxicillin can sometimes cause mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea, but these are usually temporary. If they become severe, stop the medication and contact me immediately. The decongestant will help reduce swelling in the nasal passages, which can help open up the Eustachian tube and allow the fluid in your middle ear to drain. It’s not a direct cure, but it aids the process. I'm prescribing a 7-day course of Amoxicillin, 500mg three times a day, and a decongestant such as pseudoephedrine, 30mg twice a day. I'll send the prescriptions to your pharmacy. I’d also recommend avoiding getting water in your ear for the next few days. And if your symptoms worsen – increased pain, high fever, dizziness, or significant hearing loss – please come back immediately, or go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… very helpful. Seven days of Amoxicillin. No water in the ear. I understand. Thank you very much. You are very kind to explain everything so clearly. I hope I will feel better soon. I have students waiting for me. Where is the paper with the instructions you mentioned?
DOCTOR: Here you are. It outlines everything we discussed, including potential side effects and warning signs. It also has the prescription information. Please read it carefully. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. And Mr. Radillo, please, try to get some rest. I'll see you in a week to check your progress. If you don’t improve within that time frame, we may consider a referral to an ENT specialist. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. This paper is… very good. Thank you again for your help. I will follow your instructions carefully. Goodbye, Doctor Versace. I hope you have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Radillo. Get well soon. .
