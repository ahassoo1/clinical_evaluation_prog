DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. Lots of… problems. Heart stuff, mainly. And, frankly, I’d just like to know I’m not heading down the same path. It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry, you know? I teach engineering, I’ve got things to do. Can’t be falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. It’s always prudent to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of cardiac issues. “Better safe than sorry” is a very sensible approach. Let’s start with a more detailed history. When you say "heart stuff," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay, well, my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had something with her valves, I think. Needed surgery, quite a while ago. And my uncle… he had a heart attack, maybe ten years back? He was a smoker, though. Always a bad habit. My mother has high blood pressure, she's on medication for it, and complains of chest pains sometimes. It's... a lot of worrying, if you ask me. They all seem to just wait for something to go wrong. I'm trying to be different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Valve issues, a myocardial infarction in your uncle – smoking is certainly a significant risk factor there – and your mother with hypertension and reported chest pain. That is a concerning family history, and you’re right to be proactive. When your mother experiences these chest pains, can you describe them?
PATIENT: Well, she says it’s… a tightness. Like a band around her chest. It usually happens when she’s been… overdoing it. Gardening, mostly. Or getting excited about something. She’s a bit dramatic, to be honest. She says it radiates into her left arm sometimes. And she gets short of breath. She goes to her doctor, of course, but… she always downplays it. Says it’s “just indigestion” half the time. It’s frustrating. I tell her to take it seriously.
DOCTOR: “Indigestion” is a remarkably convenient diagnosis. It's good you're encouraging her to seek proper medical attention, though. Let’s focus on you for a moment, Mr. Theriot. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Not at all. That’s why I’m probably overreacting. I feel perfectly fine. I’m pretty active, actually. I try to go for a run a few times a week. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good curry, naturally. It’s just… I read things online, you know? And it just makes you worry. My mother always said I worry too much. Maybe she’s right. But still, it's better to be sure. I wouldn't want to end up like… them.
DOCTOR: Reading medical information online can certainly be…unhelpful. It often leads to unnecessary anxiety. However, given your family history, your concern isn’t entirely unfounded. Let's get some baseline information. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one through my work… maybe six months ago? They do the basic stuff, you know? Blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, that sort of thing. I think everything was… normal. They didn’t mention anything. Honestly, I barely remember. It’s a bit of a blur. They rush you through those things, really. It's hardly a thorough examination.
DOCTOR: A work physical is often… cursory, as you say. Alright. Do you know your cholesterol levels?
PATIENT: No, not off the top of my head. I think they said something about… being within range? But I don’t recall the actual numbers. I’m really not one for memorizing things like that. I’m an engineer, Doctor, I deal with concrete problems, not… blood work. I can probably ask my HR department for the results, if you like. It’ll take some digging, though. Is it really necessary? I feel perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: While you feel healthy, Mr. Theriot, a proactive assessment is warranted given your family history. Knowing your baseline cholesterol levels is crucial. It's not about distrusting your current state, but establishing a point of reference. We'll proceed with some tests today. And, if you're able to retrieve those results from HR, that would be helpful. Now, let's discuss your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never have. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, and I get plenty of exercise. I don’t believe in relying on pills for everything. It just masks the real problem, if you ask me. Though, my mother… she’s on a few different things for her blood pressure. And she takes something for her arthritis. But me? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I pride myself on being healthy the natural way.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's briefly review your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I find those habits… distasteful. Smoking is obviously terrible for your health, and alcohol… well, it just impairs judgment. And recreational drugs? Completely unacceptable. I have a perfectly good life without needing any of those things. I focus on my work, my running, and… occasionally a good curry with friends. That’s quite enough excitement for me, thank you very much. My mother, on the other hand… she used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. But she’s cut back now, thankfully. The doctor told her she had to.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m quite resilient, if I do say so myself. I’ve always been a healthy, robust individual. I’ve never had to worry about carrying an EpiPen or anything like that. It’s just… this whole heart thing with my mother’s side… that’s the only real concern. Everything else has always been perfectly fine. I suspect it’s just anxiety, really. But better safe than sorry, as I said. I just want to make sure I’m not heading down the same path.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Given your family history and your expressed concerns, I think it is prudent to proceed with some basic cardiac testing. I'd like to order an EKG and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. We'll also check your thyroid function, just to be thorough. I'm also going to order a lipid panel, just to get a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels. And, given your mother's reports of chest pain, I'd like to schedule you for a stress test. It’s a relatively simple procedure that will help us assess how your heart functions under exertion. Do you have any questions regarding these tests?
PATIENT: A stress test? That sounds… a bit much, doesn’t it? Is it really necessary? I mean, I feel perfectly fine when I run. I’ve been running for years. And all these blood tests… it seems a bit excessive, frankly. I just wanted a quick check-up, to reassure myself that I’m not doomed to the same fate as my mother and grandmother. I didn’t expect this level of… scrutiny. I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a very busy schedule. And I really don’t like hospitals. They always smell… sterile.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, while you feel fine, asymptomatic disease is unfortunately common. A stress test is a standard procedure for evaluating cardiac function and identifying potential issues before they become serious. It’s not about assuming you have a problem, but about being proactive. And yes, the blood work is also standard. It gives us a baseline to monitor and assess your overall health. The blood work can be done here today. As for the stress test, we can schedule it for next week. It will take approximately an hour. I understand your apprehension, but I assure you, it’s a relatively non-invasive procedure. I want to emphasize that this is in your best interest. We need to gather data to assess your risk and develop an appropriate preventative plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I understand. You’re the doctor, I suppose. I just… I don’t like being told what to do. And all this worrying… it’s not helping my stress levels, if you ask me. But if it will put my mind at ease… fine. Do the tests. Just… please be quick about it. And I’d appreciate it if you could explain everything in plain English. No medical jargon, please. I’m an engineer, not a doctor. I deal with concrete things, not… valves and panels and whatever else you’re going to tell me. And I do have a meeting this afternoon, so please try not to keep me waiting too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will endeavor to be concise and explain everything in lay terms. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. The results will take a few days to come back. I will also have my nurse schedule your stress test for next week. It will be performed here in the clinic. In the meantime, continue with your regular exercise routine and maintain a healthy diet. And try to reduce your stress levels. It is detrimental to your overall health. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… please don’t keep me waiting. And I’d appreciate a clear explanation of the results, not just a bunch of numbers and medical terms. I need to understand what’s going on, if anything is going on. And… try to be a little more reassuring, if you don’t mind. This whole thing is quite unsettling, to be honest. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
