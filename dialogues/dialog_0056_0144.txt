DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Amussen, you say? Seems...foreign. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. I just... well, I don't usually see doctors unless something's really broken. My Harold – my husband, bless his soul – he always handled all this. I suppose... curiosity, mostly. It's just... things change, don't they? And I figured I should probably get a look-see, just to be sure everything's still ticking along alright. Though I can't for the life of me remember what “alright” even feels like these days.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilly. It's good you're thinking of yourself now. And you're right, things do change. “Ticking along alright” is a perfectly good way to put it. We can definitely check things out and see where you're at. So, to start, are you experiencing any specific symptoms that prompted you to come in today, or is this more of a general check-up?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Heavens, I don't even know what a symptom is anymore! Everything feels a bit… fuzzy. Achy, maybe? Old age, probably. It's not like anything's wrong wrong. I just… noticed I haven't been as spry lately. Not that I do much these days, mind you. Mostly just watch my shows and try to remember what I had for breakfast. Honestly, I think my memory is the biggest problem. Though, who needs to remember everything? It just leads to disappointment, Harold always said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some general aches and a feeling of not being quite as energetic as you used to be, and some concerns about your memory. That's a good place to start. When you say your memory isn't what it used to be, can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, examples... that's the hard part, isn't it? It's not like I forget who people are, mostly. Though, sometimes faces… they all blur together. It's more like... little things. Like, I'll go into a room and completely forget why I went there. Or I'll start a sentence and then… poof! The thought vanishes. It's terribly frustrating. And I used to be so organized! Harold always said I was a stickler for details. Now... well, let's just say my house isn't as tidy as it once was. He’d be rolling in his grave, probably.
DOCTOR: That sounds frustrating, Lilly. Forgetting what you went into a room for, losing your train of thought mid-sentence… those are definitely things to pay attention to. And it's understandable to feel concerned if you’re noticing a change from how organized you usually are. Okay. Just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, appetite. That’s a loaded question! I mostly eat what’s easy, you know? TV dinners, soup… things that don’t require a lot of effort. I don’t really feel hungry much anymore, either. As for weight… well, I’m sure I’ve lost a bit. My clothes are a little looser than they used to be, that's all I know. Not that I’m worried about it. I’m not exactly going anywhere fancy these days. Harold always said I was a little too thin, anyway. He liked a woman with some curves.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. Thank you for sharing that. Have you been experiencing any trouble sleeping, or any changes in your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep! That's another thing. I fall asleep alright, usually right in front of the television. But then I wake up… a lot. In the middle of the night, for no reason at all. I lie there staring at the ceiling for hours, just… thinking. Or not thinking. It’s hard to say. And energy levels? Ha! What energy levels? I mostly just shuffle around these days. I used to be quite the gardener, you know. Harold and I had the most beautiful roses. Now… the weeds are winning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so trouble sleeping – waking up frequently during the night – and low energy levels. That gives me a better understanding of what's going on. Lilly, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to check your heart, lungs, and overall health. And I'll also take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, physical exam. Sounds… thorough. I suppose. It’s not like I’m doing anything important, so it doesn’t really matter, does it? Harold always said I worried too much about doctors. He was a very practical man. Fine, go ahead. Just… don't poke too hard, alright? My skin is rather delicate these days. And don't expect me to remember everything you say. I warn you now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll make sure to explain everything as we go. And don’t worry about remembering, that’s what my notes are for. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me, and then exhale?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breath… like this? I take a rather shallow, wheezing breath. Is that good enough? It’s been a long time since anyone asked me to breathe deeply. Mostly just breathe to watch the television, you know? It’s not very stimulating, but it keeps me company. Harold used to say… oh, never mind. It’s just… it’s lonely, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good, Lilly. Thank you. I'm hearing a little bit of wheezing, which could be due to a number of things. We'll look into that. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, blood pressure. I always hated that cuff thing. Makes my arm feel all squeezed. Harold used to take it for me. He was good at that sort of thing. I slowly extend my arm, looking at it as if it belongs to someone else. Be gentle, dear. And try not to take too long. I have my stories on in a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that over time. Now, I'd like to listen to your abdomen. Could you lie back on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Oh, abdomen? What are you looking for in there? It’s mostly just soup and TV dinners, I assure you. I slowly and carefully maneuver myself onto the examination table, wincing slightly as I sit. This table is rather hard, you know. Harold had a very comfortable chair…
DOCTOR: Just checking for any tenderness or unusual sounds, Lilly. It’s routine. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain. We’ll start on your right side. I begin palpating her abdomen gently, observing her facial expressions for any signs of discomfort.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not very comfortable, dear. It feels a bit… poked. Like someone’s rummaging around in there. Not that there’s much to rummage around in, mind you. Just… old age, mostly. And soup. I tense up slightly as you press on her abdomen. Be careful, dear. You’re poking my soup.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I’ll be very gentle. It seems you're a bit tender there. No need to push through any discomfort. Now, I'm going to just check your reflexes. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, reflexes? What's the point of all this, dear? I'm not exactly planning on running a marathon anytime soon. I slowly sit up, bracing myself with my hands. Harold used to say I was always a bit clumsy, even when I was young. Probably why I wasn't very good at sports.
DOCTOR: Just checking your nerve function, Lilly. It's another part of the routine check-up. I'm going to gently tap on your knee with this. It might feel a little strange. Please relax your leg. I gently tap her patellar tendon with the reflex hammer.
PATIENT: Ooh! I jump slightly as the hammer hits my knee. That was… unexpected! It made my leg kick! Am I broken? Harold always said I was easily startled. He was a very observant man. I clutch my leg, looking at you with a slightly worried expression.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, you're not broken at all, Lilly! That was a perfectly normal reflex. It just means your nerves are responding. It's a good thing! It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it's not harmful. Alright, I think that’s all I need for the physical exam for now. Thank you for your patience. Now, let’s talk about your history a bit more, if you’re comfortable. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. History... that's a long story, dear. Harold always said I had a knack for forgetting things. Major illnesses... well, I had a bit of the flu a few years back. And I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was rather painful, I remember. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. Mostly, I've just been… existing. Harold took care of all the details. He always said I worried too much about doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some flu, tonsillectomy, and a broken arm. Thank you for sharing that. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… She pauses, looking off into the distance for a moment. Oh, my Harold, of course. He was an only child, poor dear. His mother passed when he was young. And my parents… they’re both gone now. A long time ago. I had a sister, but… we didn’t see each other much. She moved away. California, I think. Never really liked California myself. Too sunny. Too… cheerful. Harold always said I was a bit of a homebody. He was right, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilly. That gives me a better understanding. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear, let me think. Mostly just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It's a small white pill, I believe. And sometimes, I take something for my sleep, if I'm really having trouble. But I forget what it's called. And the dosage. Honestly, I leave most of that to the pharmacist. He’s a very nice young man. He always reminds me when it’s time for a refill. Harold used to keep track of everything…
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medication and something for sleep when needed. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm... I don't think so, dear. I've never really had any trouble with anything, really. Maybe a little sniffle in the spring, but nothing major. I always thought people who had allergies were being a bit dramatic, to be honest. Harold used to say I was very stoic. He always admired my resilience. He was a good man, my Harold. She pauses, a wistful look on her face.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. So, let's go back to what brought you in today. You mentioned some general aches, memory concerns, and feeling not quite as energetic as you used to be. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like we should investigate a few things. I'm thinking a blood test to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infection. We should also consider a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, tests... more poking and prodding, I presume? She sighs softly. Well, I suppose if it'll give me some peace of mind. Vitamins... I do try to eat my fruits and vegetables, but they don’t taste the same as they used to. Thyroid… is that serious? And a cognitive assessment… She looks at me with a slightly apprehensive expression. Does that mean I’m… losing my mind? Harold always said I worried too much.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Lilly. A cognitive assessment is just a simple set of questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It doesn't mean you're losing your mind – it's just a way to get a baseline and see if there’s anything we need to address. And a thyroid check is a routine test; many things can affect thyroid function, and it’s good to rule it out. As for the blood test, it'll just give us a better picture of your overall health. It's all very routine. We can schedule those tests for you at the lab down the hall. And then, we can follow up in a couple of weeks to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Well… alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. I suppose I trust your judgment. Though I do wish Harold was here to explain all this to me. He always knew what questions to ask. She pauses, a wistful look on her face. A couple of weeks, you say? I’ll try to remember. But don’t be surprised if I forget. And please… try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. I’ll make sure to be as gentle as possible. I’ll have the lab draw a few vials of blood, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment. I’ll also print out some instructions for you to prepare for the test, and a list of potential questions to ask if you think of anything before our next appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Though, honestly, it’s all a bit overwhelming. My Harold… he would have remembered everything. She pauses, a small, sad smile on her face. Just… thank you. For your time. And for being so patient with an old woman who can’t remember her own name half the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. And please, don’t apologize for anything. It was my pleasure. If anything comes up before our appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I'll have the nurse escort you to the lab. And I look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks. .
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. Bye bye. She shuffles slowly towards the door, looking a little lost and overwhelmed. I just hope I remember where the door is...
