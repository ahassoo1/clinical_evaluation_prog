DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well… something about a clearance? For… acting, I think. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They sent me over here. Just need to get it done, if you don't mind. Don't have a lot of time, you see.
DOCTOR: An acting clearance, you say. Yes, I see a note here about a physical for… employment purposes. It is rather vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, very vague. Honestly, I don’t recall much about signing up for anything. Just got a notice in the mail. A lot of things slip my mind these days, you know? It's… frustrating. Is this going to take long? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll need to gather some information to ensure you're fit for… the demands of acting. It's important to be thorough, even if the details are unclear. To start, can you tell me about any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. My knees ache a bit, when it's cold. And sometimes I feel… tired. Very tired. But that's just old age, I suppose. Nothing major. I haven't been sick sick, if that makes sense. No cough, no fever, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Aches and fatigue… understandable. We'll need to explore that a bit further. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s… a tough one. I think the doctor, years ago, said something about my blood pressure being a little high? And maybe… arthritis? In my hands. But it was a long time ago. I don’t really remember the details. My ex-wife usually handled all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see if we can find anything in your records. Just to be certain. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out, when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… I think I had a small growth removed from my shoulder, maybe ten years ago? It wasn’t anything serious, the doctor said. Small thing. Honestly, I mostly just remember the anesthesia.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My parents passed away a long time ago. I didn’t stay close with many relatives. I know my mother… she had something with her heart, I think. And my father… he smoked a lot. Lung problems, probably. But beyond that… I really couldn’t tell you. Sorry. It’s not that I don’t want to help, it’s just… a bit of a blank.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed as best we can. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my knees, when they really bother me. Over the counter, you know? Ibuprofen, I think it is. And sometimes, a little something to help me sleep. But not every night. Just when I’m really restless. Nothing prescribed, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but I just put on lotion. I don’t think that’s an allergy, though. Just dry skin. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Very well. To complete the assessment, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. If you would please step onto the examination table. We'll start with your vital signs and then listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A physical. Yes, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I really do have that appointment later.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiration is 16. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning, but we’ll note it. Lungs are clear bilaterally, although breath sounds are a bit diminished in the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses. Knees exhibit mild crepitus and some limited range of motion. There is some swelling. Alright. That concludes the physical examination.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sounds… complicated. Is that bad? The murmur and the diminished… whatever you said? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I don’t need a lot of details. Is it going to stop me from… acting?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, the findings aren’t necessarily alarming, but they do warrant further investigation. The murmur could be benign, but we need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. The diminished breath sounds could be related to age or other respiratory factors. As for whether it will impact your acting… that’s difficult to say without knowing the physical demands of the role. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and these findings, I recommend a few tests. An EKG to assess your heart function, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and a basic blood panel to check your overall health. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. More tests. Well, I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I really don't want to cause a fuss. But how long will it take? And… how much will it cost? I'm on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: The tests should be relatively quick, Mr. Krahn. The EKG takes only a few minutes, and the chest X-ray won’t take long either. The blood panel will require a bit more time, but we can expedite the results. As for the cost… unfortunately, without insurance, it will be approximately $450. We do offer a payment plan, if that would be helpful. However, given your limited income, I would like to refer you to a free clinic in the area. They offer comprehensive medical services at no cost to eligible patients. Would you be interested in that option?
PATIENT: Four hundred and fifty dollars… That’s… a lot. A lot. Payment plan… I don't know. I’m not good with… finances. A free clinic… Yes. Yes, please. A free clinic sounds… much better. If you could refer me, that would be wonderful. Just… I really need to get this cleared up. This acting thing… it means a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will prepare a referral to the Urban Wellness Clinic. They have a good reputation and can provide the necessary testing and evaluation. I will also include your examination findings in the letter. You should receive a call from them within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it would be prudent to monitor your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. I recommend checking it twice daily and keeping a record of your readings. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Twice daily… right. I can try. No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you… for everything. For the referral, and for… not laughing at me. I know I’m a bit of a mess. Just… I hope they can figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You are not a mess, Mr. Krahn. It's perfectly understandable to be uncertain about these matters. The Urban Wellness Clinic will provide a thorough evaluation and determine the appropriate course of action. Here is the referral letter and a list of local pharmacies where you can purchase a home blood pressure monitor. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions. I wish you all the best with your acting endeavor. That concludes our consultation. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
