DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look here, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, it's about how I look. Getting old is a disgrace, you know? Always people saying I look tired. I am tired, from work! But still. It's the face, mostly. Not happy with it, no sir.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You're concerned about your appearance and feeling tired. It's perfectly valid to want to address those concerns. Just to clarify, when did you start noticing these changes in your appearance?
PATIENT: Changes? Changes been happening for… well, decades! But the last year, people really started saying things. My wife… she used to say I looked handsome. She passed last year, see? Now it's just… comments. Annoying comments. Don't need a history lesson on wrinkles, Doctor. Just want to fix it.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Trendler. That must be incredibly difficult. And you’re right, we don’t need to dwell on the history of wrinkles. You want to know what options we have to address your concerns about your appearance. To help me understand what’s bothering you most, could you tell me specifically what changes you have noticed?
PATIENT: Changes I noticed? Look at this! These lines here. Deep as a well. And this… … sagging. Everything’s going south, you understand? And the eyes… tired looking. Always tired. People think I’m sick. I ain’t sick. Just… old. And it's disrespectful, that's what it is. A man should look… strong. Not like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, lines around the mouth, sagging skin on the neck, and tired appearance around the eyes. We can certainly explore some options. Before we talk about those, I'd like to get a little more information, just to make sure there isn't anything else contributing to how you're feeling. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. Never had any of that. Strong as an ox, I was. Still am, for a man my age. Pile driving ain’t for the weak, you know. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Private insurance, good stuff. They cover everything. Don't need to worry 'bout that. Doctor, are you suggesting I'm sick?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Trendler, absolutely not. I’m just asking routine questions to get a complete picture. Some medical conditions can affect skin health and appearance, that's all. Okay, so no diabetes, no high blood pressure. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had an allergy in my life. Jamaican man, strong immune system. Don't take no pills, don't need no pills. Just want to know what you can do about the face, Doctor. I ain't got time for a whole check-up. Just fix the wrinkles. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, no medications. Just the appearance concerns. I understand your frustration with the time, Mr. Trendler. Let's focus on that. To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me about any previous cosmetic procedures you've had?
PATIENT: Cosmetic procedures? You think I'm one of them fancy men? No! Never had nothing done. All natural. Used to be a handsome man, now I'm… this. Don’t need no needles, no cutting, no… nonsense. Just something to tighten things up. You got creams? Maybe a… I don't know… a machine? Something quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior cosmetic procedures. We can certainly discuss some non-invasive options. Creams can help with hydration and some fine lines, but they won’t provide a dramatic change. There are also some machines that use radiofrequency or ultrasound to stimulate collagen production, which can tighten the skin a bit. Before we talk about those specifically, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to assess the skin’s condition. It will only take a few minutes. Can I take a look at your face?
PATIENT: Look here, I don’t like being poked and prodded. I told you, I ain't sick. I just want to know if you can fix it. Can you, or can't you? Stop wasting my time with examinations. Just tell me what you can do. I ain't here for a beauty contest. And I really don't like being touched.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your reluctance. It sounds like you’re primarily interested in knowing what options are available for improving your appearance without any invasive procedures. Given your concerns and your aversion to a full examination, I can discuss some potential non-invasive treatments. However, without a proper assessment of your skin type and condition, it’s difficult to give you specific recommendations or guarantee results. We could consider options like topical retinoids, chemical peels – gentle ones, of course – and potentially radiofrequency skin tightening. But I strongly recommend a consultation with a dermatologist who can perform a thorough evaluation. They can determine the best course of action for your skin. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: Referral? To another doctor? Look, I came here! I thought you were the expert! I don’t want to run around to a whole heap of doctors. Waste of time. Look, if you can't tell me what you can do right now, I'm leaving. I ain't got all day to be sent on wild goose chases. I want a quick fix, not a lecture. What creams? Tell me about the creams. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration. We can discuss topical creams. Retinol is a vitamin A derivative that can help with fine lines and wrinkles, but it takes several months to see results, and it can cause some initial irritation. There are also creams with hyaluronic acid, which can hydrate the skin and temporarily plump it up. And some contain vitamin C, which is an antioxidant that can protect against sun damage. However, I must reiterate that these creams are unlikely to provide a dramatic improvement. And they're not a substitute for a professional evaluation. Here’s some information on some over-the-counter options. I recommend starting with a low concentration to avoid irritation. Given your concerns and your reluctance to pursue other options, I don’t think I can provide the level of care you’re looking for. If you change your mind about a referral to a dermatologist, please let me know. .
