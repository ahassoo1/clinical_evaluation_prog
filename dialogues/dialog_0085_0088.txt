DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, it's Jaylyne, yeah. Look, to be honest, I just… I've got this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now and it’s starting to get to me. I just want to figure out what's causing it, if that's alright? I haven’t been sleeping great because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne, ringing in the ears – that’s what we call tinnitus. And trouble sleeping is definitely something we need to address. It’s good you came in. Can you tell me a bit more about the ringing?
PATIENT: Right, tinnitus. Sounds fancy. Um… well, it's not constant, not like a proper high-pitched whine all the time. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s more of a buzzing, other times it’s… like a faint clicking. It's hard to explain. It's louder when it's quiet, you know? Like when I’m trying to sleep, or when I’m just relaxing. Does that make sense? I work as a waiter, so there’s usually a lot of noise where I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent tinnitus, varying in tone… and louder in quiet environments – that’s quite common. And working in a noisy environment is definitely something we should consider. Roughly how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little thing here and there. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last month or so. I thought it was just from being tired, honestly. Work's been busy. I’m divorced, so things are a bit… hectic at home too, if you know what I mean. Just a lot going on.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jaylyne. Life changes and stress can definitely contribute to things like this. So, three to four months, gradually worsening, more noticeable recently… Have you noticed any changes in your hearing along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Good question. Um… I haven’t really thought about it, to be honest. I’m not sure. I can still hear alright, I think. People don’t seem to have trouble understanding me when I talk. Maybe… maybe things are a little muffled sometimes? But I just put that down to being tired. I don’t know. Is there a way to check? I wouldn't even know what to look for.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It’s easy to miss those subtle changes. We can do a quick hearing test right here in the office – it's non-invasive and will give us a good baseline. Before we do that, though, let’s quickly go through some other things. Have you had any ear infections recently, or any pain or discharge from your ears?
PATIENT: No, no ear infections. Nothing like that. No pain, no discharge, nothing. My ears just feel… normal, apart from the ringing, obviously. I’ve never really had trouble with my ears before, to be honest. Just the usual wax build-up sometimes. I get that cleaned out now and then. I’ve got private insurance, if that helps? I just want to get this sorted, really. It's driving me crazy when I'm trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No infections, no pain or discharge. That’s helpful. And thank you for letting me know about the insurance. Now, have you been exposed to any loud noises recently outside of work?
PATIENT: Um… not really? I went to a wedding a few weeks ago, and the band was pretty loud, I guess. But that was just for a few hours. And I didn’t really stand right next to the speakers. Honestly, I try to avoid really loud places if I can. Work is loud enough, you know? I don't go to concerts or anything. I'm not a big music person, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, wedding a few weeks ago, but not generally exposed to loud noises… And you mentioned you’re divorced – have you experienced any significant stress or anxiety recently related to that?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, it's been… a bit rough. It’s been about a year since we split, and it’s still not easy. There's… a lot of sorting out still going on. Legal stuff, dividing things… it’s stressful, alright? I try to keep busy, but it’s always in the back of my mind. It's probably not helping the sleeping, I'll tell you that much. I'm not usually one to complain, but… it’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jaylyne. It sounds like you've been dealing with a great deal of stress, and it’s perfectly understandable that it’s affecting your sleep. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam and then we can perform a hearing test. I'd like to take a look at your ears and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's going on with this ringing. It's just… frustrating. And the sleeping is just awful. So, yeah, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could have a seat here, we’ll start with a quick look in your ears. Okay, your ear canals and tympanic membranes look normal. There’s a little bit of cerumen, but nothing significant. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s proceed with the hearing test. It's a simple test where you’ll wear headphones, and you'll indicate when you hear a sound. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Sounds good. Headphones, yeah? Alright. I'm not great with medical stuff, as you can tell, so just… tell me what to do. I just want this over with, to be honest. Hopefully, we can figure something out. I've got work tomorrow, so I can't be here all day. Just tell me what I need to listen for.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No worries at all, I'll walk you through everything. You'll wear these headphones, and I'll play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. When you hear a sound, just press the button. Don't worry if you miss some, that’s perfectly normal. It won't hurt at all. Just focus on listening for the sounds. I’ll start now. Alright, Jaylyne, please tell me if you hear anything. Press the button when you detect a tone. We'll start with your right ear.
PATIENT: Okay, right ear… button… got it. presses button … Yep, I heard something… presses button again … There. pauses … Nothing… pauses … Oh, there… presses button… It’s really faint, though. Hard to tell sometimes. continues to listen intently and respond to the tones.… This is… kinda boring. But I'm doing my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne, that's all for the hearing test. Thank you for your patience. Alright, so the results show a mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. It’s not severe, but it is present. This is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss, which makes sense given your work environment. It's also possible the stress you’ve been experiencing may contribute to it. The tinnitus you’re experiencing is likely related to this hearing loss. It’s quite common.
PATIENT: Okay… mild hearing loss… noise-induced… So, my work? That’s what’s doing it? Is it… bad? Do I need to quit my job? I need to work, you know? I’ve got bills to pay. And… stress? So even just being stressed can make it worse? This is a lot to take in. What can I do about it? Is there anything I can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take this one step at a time. No, you don’t need to quit your job immediately. Mild hearing loss is very common, and we can manage it. The first step is to protect your hearing as much as possible at work. Do you have access to earplugs or earmuffs?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. The manager has a box of earplugs, but they’re… not the most comfortable. They don’t really block out much noise. And everyone just kinda looks at you weird if you wear them. It's a busy restaurant, you know? I usually just try to tune it out, I guess. I know, it's stupid. But yeah, that's about it. Is there anything better I can get? Something that won't make me look… silly? And what about the tinnitus? Will it just… stay like this forever?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s important to be comfortable, and I appreciate your honesty. There are custom-molded earplugs that are much more comfortable and provide better noise reduction. They’re an investment, but they can make a big difference. I can give you a referral to an audiologist who can assess your ears and fit you with a pair. Regarding the tinnitus, it doesn't necessarily mean it will stay like this forever. In many cases, it improves over time, especially if we address the underlying hearing loss and manage your stress levels. There are also tinnitus retraining therapy options and sound therapy apps that can help you cope with the ringing. We can explore those if it doesn't improve with other measures. For now, I recommend prioritizing hearing protection at work, stress management techniques like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness, and getting enough sleep. I can also give you a referral to a therapist if you’d like to explore stress management options further. We’ll start with protecting your ears and managing your stress. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… custom earplugs… a therapist… That’s… a lot. But I guess it makes sense. Anything is better than this ringing, to be honest. I’ll try the earplugs, definitely. And I'll… try to get more sleep. Maybe download one of those apps. Can you just… write down the names of the audiologist and the therapist? And maybe a website for the apps? I just… want to get this sorted, you know? And hopefully get a good night’s sleep. Work's been awful, and this ringing is just making it worse. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Here you go. I’ve also included a few websites and app recommendations for tinnitus management. As for anything else, try to avoid loud noises whenever possible, even outside of work. Limit your caffeine and alcohol intake, as these can sometimes worsen tinnitus. And make sure you’re eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated. We'll follow up in about three months to see how you're doing with the earplugs and stress management techniques. If your tinnitus doesn’t improve, we can discuss other options, such as tinnitus retraining therapy. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thanks. Thanks for not making me feel stupid, and for explaining everything. It’s… a lot to take in, but I feel a little better knowing there are things I can do. I'll try the earplugs and the stress stuff. And I’ll come back in three months. Hopefully, things will be better by then. Thank you, Doctor Lahn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. It was my pleasure. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this process. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
