DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, let's get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pehrson. It’s Rayshun Knabenshue, if that helps. I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice. I’m here regarding a… well, a situation at my workplace. It concerns the masks, and the other protective gear we’re required to wear. I need to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps an alternative.
DOCTOR: Right. Masks. Look, I’ve seen a lot of these requests lately. Everyone's suddenly a medical expert. Is this about discomfort?
PATIENT: No, sir, it’s not simply discomfort. It's… a bit more involved than that. I have some… sensitivities that make wearing a mask for extended periods difficult. It isn’t just that it’s unpleasant, it actually causes me some… trouble. I can explain further, if you’d like. I brought some documentation with me, just in case it would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Documentation…right. Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I’m a family doctor, not a specialist in… whatever this is. What kind of trouble are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well, sir, it's hard to explain precisely. It's a… a feeling of being restricted, a tightness in my chest. It brings back… memories, if you understand. Bad memories. It’s connected to things that happened a long time ago, things I don’t often talk about. It causes… anxiety, and makes it difficult to focus on my work. It’s not something I can just “get over,” Doctor. I apologize for not being more clear. It’s a difficult thing to put into words.
DOCTOR: Okay, so… anxiety triggered by a mask. And this is… new?
PATIENT: Not entirely new, no. It started mildly when masks were first recommended, but it’s gotten progressively worse as the requirement has become stricter. It’s… it’s like a weight on my chest, growing heavier each day. It doesn’t happen every time I wear a mask, but it’s become increasingly frequent, and more intense. It interferes with my ability to do my job, and frankly, it’s… unsettling. I’m a Protective Service Worker, Doctor. I need to be calm and focused to help people.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Protective Service Worker… okay. And you're saying this anxiety specifically relates to the mask?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that’s correct. It’s the feeling of being… contained, restricted. It’s hard to explain the connection, but it brings up… feelings from a very difficult time in my life. It isn’t a fear of germs, or illness, it’s… a personal reaction to the sensation of having my face covered. I’ve tried different types of masks, different techniques for relaxation, but nothing seems to alleviate the problem completely. It’s a genuine issue, Doctor, and it’s affecting my work and my well-being.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm going to be blunt. This sounds… complicated. And frankly, outside my area of expertise. Have you considered… therapy?
PATIENT: That… is a fair question, Doctor. I have, yes. I’ve looked into it, but there’s a long waitlist, and the cost is… substantial. Medicare covers some of it, but not all. I was hoping to explore alternatives first, if possible. Perhaps a medical exemption would allow me to continue working safely while I wait for an appointment. I understand your hesitation, sir, but I assure you, this is a legitimate concern. Is that something you might be able to help me with?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm a practical man. And frankly, giving out medical exemptions without a clear medical reason… that opens me up to a lot of trouble. I need something concrete. Has a specialist diagnosed this?
PATIENT: No, sir, not yet. As I mentioned, the wait times are extensive. I haven’t been formally diagnosed, but I can provide documentation from my primary care physician outlining my history of anxiety, and detailing the specific triggers. It isn't a new condition, Doctor, it’s something I’ve dealt with for many years. But the masks… they’ve exacerbated it significantly. Perhaps that, combined with my medical records, would be sufficient? I understand your concerns about liability, sir, but I’m not trying to circumvent the rules, I’m seeking a reasonable accommodation.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm not going to get into a back-and-forth about medical records and "triggers." This is a workplace issue. I suggest you talk to HR. They can probably provide you with… accommodations. Or maybe a different job. I've got other patients waiting. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: I… I see. So, you’re unwilling to consider a medical exemption, even with documentation from my physician? I understand you're busy, Doctor, but I was hoping for a professional opinion, not a dismissal. HR has been… unhelpful. They simply state the mask policy is mandatory, and offer no alternatives. I came to you seeking medical guidance, hoping you could offer a solution. It seems I was mistaken. Very well. No, sir, there is nothing else. Thank you for your time. .
