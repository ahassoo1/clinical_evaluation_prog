DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s… like a pain, in my breast. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of chest pain. Can you tell me a little more about that pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a sharp pain. More like… achey. And it’s not always in the same spot. Sometimes it’s more on this side <points to left chest>, sometimes more on that side <points to right chest>. It doesn't really hurt to touch it, though. Just… feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s an achy discomfort, not a sharp pain, and it shifts around a bit. Good to know it's not tender to the touch. Does anything specifically bring it on or make it worse – like exercise, deep breathing, or maybe even certain positions?
PATIENT: Not really that I’ve noticed. I do a lot of… roof work, you know? Lifting and stuff. And it doesn't seem to bother it more then. Sleeping doesn’t make it worse, or better. Just… happens. Sometimes I just feel it, while I’m working, or watching TV.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it doesn’t seem to be linked to activity or position, which is helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever. No… lumps. Nothing like that. Just the pain. My wife asked if there was any… discharge, but no. Nothing. I just thought it was… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no lumps, no discharge – that’s good to know. And it is good you’re getting it checked out. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little cough, maybe a month ago, but it didn’t last long. Just a normal little cough. Nothing bad. And I haven’t been sick before that, not for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illness. And you said you haven’t been sick for a long time – that’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any heart problems before, or has anyone in your family?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But no heart trouble. And I… I don’t think I’ve ever had any heart problems. I work hard, but… I feel okay. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure, but no known heart problems. Let's talk about any medications you might be taking, and any allergies you have. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: No medications. I don’t take anything. And no allergies that I know of. I eat anything. My wife makes good food! <chuckles softly> I've never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good, no medications or allergies. Okay, Aron, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your chest a bit. It's just to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Sounds good. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be perfect. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. No tenderness to palpation, no obvious masses. I don't feel anything concerning there. Your breast tissue feels… normal, no palpable lumps. Given what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it’s less likely to be something serious like a heart problem or lung issue. It could be musculoskeletal pain – pain originating from the muscles or ribs in your chest wall. Do you do a lot of twisting or reaching at work?
PATIENT: Yes! A lot of reaching. And twisting. We have to move things on the roof, you know? And… sometimes it’s awkward. Lifting heavy stuff at strange angles. Maybe that’s it? That makes sense.
DOCTOR: It very well could be. Lifting heavy things at awkward angles can strain the muscles and ligaments in your chest wall. Now, to be safe, and because you've been experiencing this for a few weeks, I’d like to order a chest x-ray. It'll give us a better look at your lungs and rule out anything else that might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If it makes sure everything is okay, then yes. I don’t want anything serious, you know? I need to work. My wife… she worries.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's always best to be thorough, especially when it comes to your health. I'll get the order for the x-ray sent over to the radiology department. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. It usually doesn’t take long. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and try to avoid strenuous lifting if possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. I can take some of those pills. And I’ll try to… not lift too much. It’s hard, but I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. We'll get those results back quickly, and we can discuss them then. I'll also give you a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the x-ray order and instructions. I'll also give you some written instructions on proper lifting techniques to help prevent this from happening again. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You explained everything very well. I appreciate you taking the time. And writing things down is good, my wife likes that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could help. Here's the summary with the x-ray order and lifting techniques. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens before your x-ray appointment. I’m optimistic that this is just a muscle strain, but we want to rule out anything else. Take care, Aron, and I'll see you back here once we have the x-ray results.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. I will. Bye bye.
