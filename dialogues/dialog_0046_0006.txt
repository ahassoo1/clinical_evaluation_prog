DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well… I have been coughing, and… there was blood. In the… spit. I was very surprised. It happened a few times now, and that is why I came. I was… worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly is concerning, Ms. Weichers, and you did the right thing coming in to have it checked out. Blood in the sputum, or spit, is something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it is not a bad cough, not all the time. Sometimes it feels… dry. And sometimes… a little bit wet. But not much. And the blood… it is not a lot of blood. More like… streaks. Red streaks. It happened mostly in the mornings. I don't know if that is important.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Weichers. Streaks of blood, especially more prominent in the mornings, does give us some clues. You mentioned it's not a bad cough, but has it been getting worse over time, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Hmm… stable, I think. Maybe… a little bit worse in the last week? It is hard to say for sure. I did not pay much attention until the blood came. My husband… he always said I didn’t pay attention to my body. But he is… gone now. So… it has been harder to… notice things. I am sorry, I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Please don’t apologize at all, Ms. Weichers. You're doing just fine, and it’s perfectly normal to have difficulty explaining things, especially when you’re feeling worried. And I’m very sorry for your loss. It's understandable that things have been harder lately. Let’s focus on the cough for now. Besides the blood, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Um… sometimes I feel a little… tired. But I work long hours, so I am always a little tired. And… I have been a little bit… breathless. Not a lot, just when I climb the stairs. Or if I walk very fast. It is not… stopping me from doing things, but I notice it. Oh! And… maybe a little bit of a… ache in my chest. Not a sharp pain, just… dull.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some breathlessness with exertion, and a dull ache in the chest. That’s all very important information. To get a more complete picture, let's do a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have been healthy, mostly. I have had the… flu, of course, a few times. And I broke my arm when I was a child. But I have not had… serious illnesses. My doctor… he always said I was very strong. He said my lungs were… very good. I worked with many sick people, you see, as a physical therapist. I needed to be strong.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it is quite impressive that you've remained healthy despite working in a setting with many sick individuals. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than a broken arm?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. And I have not been in the hospital since I was a child. Just for the arm, when it broke. They… put it in a cast. That is all. I prefer to avoid hospitals, if possible. I see enough sickness at work. It is… depressing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Weichers. Most people would feel the same way. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he smoked for many years. He… passed away from lung problems, I believe. But it was a long time ago, and I do not remember much detail. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. We do not see each other very often. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: That is important to know, Ms. Weichers. Your father’s history of smoking and lung problems is certainly relevant. And your mother’s high blood pressure is good information as well. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he smoked, but he… stopped many years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health. And… I do not drink much alcohol either. Just a small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but it is… difficult with my work schedule. Long hours, you see. I do not have much time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I can take most medications without problems. I do not take any medications regularly, though. Just… pain relievers for headaches, sometimes. And… allergy medicine if the pollen is very bad. But that is all. I have a very strong stomach, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. It's very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle. I do not like pain, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Weichers. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Then I'll check your oxygen saturation with this small clip on your finger. It doesn't hurt. I’m hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. It’s subtle, but worth noting. Your heart sounds normal. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is good. I notice some mild tenderness when I press on your chest here and here. Does that feel particularly painful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… feels a little bit sore. Not sharp pain, but… like a bruise, maybe. It has been like that for a few days, I think. I did not pay much attention. It just… ached. I thought it was from sleeping in a bad position. Is that… bad? I feel a little bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be worried, Ms. Weichers. That tenderness is something we'll want to investigate further. Now, I'd like to check your throat and listen to your neck. Can you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. “Ahhhh.” Is that alright? I try to say it as loud as possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Your throat looks clear. Now, I'm going to feel your lymph nodes in your neck. I do feel some slight swelling in a few of your lymph nodes on both sides of your neck. They aren't dramatically enlarged, but they're noticeable. Given your symptoms – the cough, the streaks of blood in your sputum, the fatigue, the chest ache, and these findings on the physical exam – I think it's important to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… wise. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is happening. It is… unsettling, not knowing. Tests… that is good. What kind of tests? Will they… hurt? I am a little bit nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Weichers, and I will explain everything clearly. We'll start with a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It doesn't hurt at all – you’ll just stand or sit while a technician takes a picture. We’ll also draw some blood for a complete blood count, to check for signs of infection or inflammation. That will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually quick and relatively painless. And finally, I’d like to order a sputum culture to identify any bacteria or other organisms that might be causing your cough. You'll need to cough up a sample of sputum into a container. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds manageable. X-ray, blood… and the… sputum. I can do that. I will try my best to cough up the… sample. When do we do these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have work, you see. I need to plan accordingly. I do not want to… worry my colleagues unnecessarily. They are already very busy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do the chest X-ray and blood draw right here in the clinic today. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or so. The sputum culture will require you to come back tomorrow morning, as it's best to collect a fresh sample. As for the results, the chest X-ray results usually come back within a few hours. The blood work will take about 24-48 hours. The sputum culture, unfortunately, takes a bit longer – usually 3-5 business days to get accurate results. I will have the nurse schedule you for the sputum culture collection tomorrow morning and give you instructions on how to collect the sample properly. I understand your concern about work, and we'll do our best to expedite the process. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, experience severe shortness of breath, or have any significant chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds very organized. X-ray and blood today, sputum tomorrow. And… if it gets worse, go to the hospital. I will remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so… clearly. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what is happening. I trust you will… find out what is wrong. Do I need to do anything before the X-ray and blood draw? Should I… fast? Or avoid anything? I do not want to… interfere with the tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad you feel a bit more reassured. No, you don’t need to fast or avoid anything specific before the X-ray or blood draw. You can eat and drink as usual. Just wear comfortable clothing for the X-ray – nothing with metal zippers or buttons near your chest. The nurse will go over everything with you in detail before each test. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered everything very… thoroughly. Thank you again. I will… wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. Please don't hesitate to let the nurse or me know if anything changes or if you have any questions later. We'll get to the bottom of this together. .
