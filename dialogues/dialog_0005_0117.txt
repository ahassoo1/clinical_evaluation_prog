DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. So, you’re here today… tell me what brings you in. Don’t leave anything out, no matter how small it seems. I have a lot of patients to see, so let’s get right to it.
PATIENT: Well… coughin’. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there was some… red in it. Not a lot, but… yeah. Red. I smoke, you see. Been smokin’ a long time. Don’t remember exactly when I started… long time though. Is that what you want to know? I just want this to be quick if we can.
DOCTOR: Right. Coughing, with some blood. And a long smoking history… that’s… helpful. “Long” isn’t very specific, Mr. Reyno. Do you smoke a pack a day?
PATIENT: A pack…? Hmm. Sometimes. Not every day. Maybe… five or six cigarettes a day when I’m workin’. Less when I’m… not. It's hard to say exactly. I don’t really count ‘em. Been a habit, that’s all. Power work keeps me movin’, if you know what I mean. It gets… stressful. Does it matter how many?
DOCTOR: It matters a great deal, Mr. Reyno. It allows me to gauge the severity of potential damage. Five or six cigarettes a day is still significant. And stress… well, that doesn’t help either. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… … I get tired easier, maybe. And a little… short of breath sometimes, when I’m climbin’ poles. But I’ve always gotten winded easy. Always been a bit… out of shape, I guess. Is that the blood, do you think? Makes me tired? I don’t really pay attention to much of that stuff. Just… work. And cough. That’s all I really know.
DOCTOR: “A little” short of breath is also vague, Mr. Reyno. Is it getting worse?
PATIENT: Worse…? … I think so. Maybe. It’s hard to tell. The poles are getting… higher, I think. Or maybe I’m just getting older. Fifty-four years… that’s a long time to be climbin’ poles. I don't know, really. I just feel… wore out. Everything feels… slow. Does that make sense? Is the blood makin' me tired, like you said? I just want to know if it's somethin' serious. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Reyno, smoking does tend to cause… issues with the lungs. We need to rule some things out. I'm going to listen to your lungs now, and then I’ll need to get a chest X-ray. And while we're at it, I need a full medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? … Hmm… Let me think… I broke my arm once, when I was a kid. Fallin’ off a horse. But that was… a long time ago. And… I had the flu pretty bad a few years back, but I just stayed home, rested. Didn't go to the hospital. Never really been sick enough to go to the hospital, if you know what I mean. Just… tough it out. That’s what we do. Can we just… see what the X-ray says? I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “toughing it out” doesn’t always work, Mr. Reyno. It can lead to things getting much worse. But fine. We'll start with the X-ray. Nurse will be in shortly to take you back and get that done. And then we will discuss the results. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? … Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin’. Just… the smoke, maybe. Makes me cough. But that’s… not an allergy, is it? Can we just get this over with? I got lines to fix out west. People need power. Nurse can just… do whatever she needs to do. I trust you folks. Just wanna know if it’s bad. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. The nurse will be with you momentarily. Try to relax. We’ll get this sorted out. And please, try to be more forthcoming with information. It helps me help you.
