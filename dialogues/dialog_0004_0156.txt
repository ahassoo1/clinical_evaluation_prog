DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I think. It’s been… off. Like, a lot of… bathroom trips. It's been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent, you know? I’m not really sure what’s causing it, honestly. I just feel… uncomfortable all the time.
DOCTOR: Persistent discomfort, alright. And when you say “a bit now,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specific… that’s hard. I guess… maybe a couple of weeks? It comes and goes, but it’s been there for at least that long. It’s hard to remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit blurry lately. I do remember it being worse after I ate something… spicy, maybe? But it happens even when I haven’t.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, fluctuating… and exacerbated by spicy foods. Okay. And can you describe what these “bathroom trips” entail?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it’s diarrhea. A lot of it. It’s… watery, if that makes sense? And… frequent. Like, I can’t really go anywhere without worrying about it, you know? It's just… a mess, honestly. Sorry to be so… graphic. I don’t really like talking about this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Nahrwold, it's important to be accurate when describing your symptoms. Frequent, watery stools for approximately two weeks. Do you notice any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood… hmm. I don’t think so? It’s hard to say for sure, I don’t really… look, to be honest. I just… go. I might have seen a little bit of red once, but I wasn't sure if it was just… something I ate? And mucus… maybe? Everything just looks kind of… messed up, you know? I really don't pay that much attention. Sorry. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Possibly a small amount of blood noticed once, and possibly mucus. And beyond the diarrhea, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I’ve been really tired, actually. More tired than usual. And a little bit achy, all over. Not like a fever, just… sore. And… my appetite’s been off. I haven't been feeling very hungry. Oh! And I think I've lost a little weight, but I haven't actually weighed myself recently to be sure. Is that… is that normal? I don't know. Everything feels off, like I said.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, generalized aches, decreased appetite, possible weight loss… Alright. Have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. Not at all. Just… the stomach stuff, and feeling tired and icky. And maybe a little… bloated sometimes? Like, my stomach feels really full, even when I haven’t eaten much. But mostly it's just… the bathroom. It's ruining my life a bit, honestly. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… that’s hard. I don’t really remember much. I had… the usual childhood stuff, I guess? Chickenpox, things like that. But nothing major. Oh! I was diagnosed with something… a stomach thing… when I was younger. Something about… not being able to eat certain foods. I think my mom said it was… celiac? Or something like that? It was a long time ago, and I don't really remember the details. I try to avoid gluten, I think, but I haven't been super strict about it lately. And… I'm married, if that matters. Does that make sense? It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses, possible history of celiac disease… It does matter. Being married is relevant for family history considerations. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Just… pain relievers sometimes, if I have a headache. Like ibuprofen or something. And… maybe a multivitamin, sometimes, but I’ve been forgetting to take it lately. Oh! And I take something for… heartburn? It's a little purple pill. I think it's pretty common. That's it, I think. Nothing else regular. Honestly, I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I just feel like everything makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmmm… not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything lately. My mom always said I was pretty good with food, even spicy stuff. But… maybe a little bit itchy after eating shellfish once? It wasn't anything major, just… a little bit uncomfortable. And… I think I get a rash if I touch poison ivy, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I honestly don’t really pay much attention to that stuff. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… that’s tough. I don't really know much about my dad’s side of the family. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And… her mom had something with her stomach. She was always sick. Not like this, but… something autoimmune, maybe? I don't really remember the details. My aunt on my mom's side has diabetes. And… I think my grandfather had heart problems. But honestly, I don't know a lot of the details. We don't really talk about medical stuff much. It's kind of a mess. Sorry. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no smoking, definitely not. And… rarely drink. Like, maybe a glass of wine at a special occasion, once in a blue moon. And definitely no drugs. Never. I just… don’t do that stuff. It's not for me. I work, and… I'm married. That's pretty much it. I don’t really have a lot of time for… anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we proceed, I need to conduct a physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I've been feeling pretty awful lately. I just… hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on your back. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen. I'll need you to point to any areas where you're experiencing pain or discomfort. I hear some active bowel sounds, which is normal, but there's a little bit of tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the left side. Not alarming, but something to note. Now, I’m going to check your vital signs. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 88 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. All within normal limits. I am also going to check for any signs of dehydration. Skin turgor is slightly diminished, which could suggest mild dehydration. Do you feel thirsty frequently?
PATIENT: Oh… yeah, that’s… a little tender there. And yeah… I have been really thirsty lately. Like, constantly. I’m always reaching for a glass of water. I just figured it was because it’s been so hot. But yeah, I’m drinking a lot more than usual, for sure. It's a bit uncomfortable, always having to pee, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. I also want to check your stool sample. Please collect a sample and hand it to the nurse before you leave today. That will help us rule out any infections or parasites. Now, based on your symptoms and the preliminary exam findings – persistent diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, mild dehydration, and increased thirst – there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be gastroenteritis—a stomach bug—but given the duration and the history of possible celiac disease, we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool culture. I also recommend a celiac disease panel to confirm or rule out that diagnosis. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That sounds… a lot. But yeah, whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? Complete blood count, metabolic panel… and the celiac thing… Okay. What do I do about the sample? Do I need a special container or something? And… how long will it take to get the results? I need to go back to work next week, so…
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide you with the necessary collection container and instructions for collecting the stool sample. It's pretty straightforward, and they'll be happy to answer any questions you have. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for everything to come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated. Continue to drink plenty of fluids—water, broth, electrolyte solutions—to replace the fluids lost through diarrhea. Avoid foods that worsen your symptoms—spicy foods, dairy, sugary drinks, and caffeine. I also want to emphasize the importance of following up with me once you get the results. Ignoring these symptoms or attempting to self-treat could lead to complications. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Three to five days… okay. And yeah, I’ll definitely drink more water. I've already been trying to. And I guess I can avoid the spicy stuff, even though I love it. Um… no, I don't think so. Just… please let it not be anything serious? And thanks for… explaining everything. I really appreciate it. I guess I’ll go find the nurse and get the container.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse's station is just down the hall. Let me know if you need assistance. And Ms. Nahrwold… try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
