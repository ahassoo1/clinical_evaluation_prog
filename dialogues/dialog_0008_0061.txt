DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... well, my son, he signed me up. Something about a... tryout? For a team? I'm an old man, I don't play no sports no more. My knees, they ain't what they used to be, you see. I just... showed up. He said I needed a check-up first. Does that make sense? I forget things easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, that makes perfect sense. It’s good your son is thinking ahead and wants to make sure you’re healthy. A check-up is always a good idea. So, even though you’re not actively training, we'll go through a standard assessment. Let's start with why he thought a check-up was a good idea. Have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Hmm... well, I get tired faster, I guess. And my back... it aches a bit, especially when I bend over. But that's just old age, right? I don't feel sick, not really. Just... slower. And maybe a little forgetful, like I said. Is that what you mean by different? I don't know... it's hard to say. Everything feels a little bit off sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, that's exactly what I mean. Fatigue, back pain, and some memory issues… those are all things we should look into. “A little bit off” is a good way to put it. When did you first start noticing this fatigue and back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. When did I notice... oh dear. It's been... a while. Maybe... six months ago? Or was it a year? Time just... goes by, you see. I remember it started slowly. Just a little tired after doing things, then a little more. The back pain came on after I helped my grandson with some garden work. He's a strong boy, that one. He had me lifting things I shouldn't have been. I don't remember exactly when though. Sorry, Doctor. It's like trying to grab smoke.
DOCTOR: No problem, sir. It's alright. We can work with that. Roughly six months, then. And the back pain started after helping your grandson. Do you remember if anything specific happened while you were gardening that might have caused it?
PATIENT: Well... I think I bent over too far, trying to pull up a big weed. It was a stubborn one! I felt a little pop in my back, and then it just hurt to move. Not terrible, at first. Just a little sore. But it didn't go away. My wife, she rubbed some cream on it, but it kept coming back, you know? It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, all the time. I don't think I did anything serious, but it's always there. And it makes me walk a little slower. I don't want to fall, you see. Old bones break easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a "pop" while bending over, followed by a dull ache. That gives us something to work with. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your back and see how you're moving. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My heart... I think it's okay. Sometimes it skips a beat, but my wife says it's just nerves. And my lungs... I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. Maybe twenty years ago? I don’t know. Feel free to check everything. I trust you. I just want to make sure I’m not gonna fall over, you know? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just relax your arm for me... and then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we’ll check your back. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing. Have you had a cough recently?
