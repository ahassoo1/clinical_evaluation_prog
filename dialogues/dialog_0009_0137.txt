DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place I want to live, for old people? They need me to… check with doctor first. For… okay to go there. Is that right? My husband, he make the appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. So, your husband scheduled this appointment because the assisted living facility requires a medical evaluation before you can move in?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is it. He worries too much, my husband. But is good place, they say. Nice and quiet. I just need… paper from doctor to say I am okay? Is that all?
DOCTOR: That's right, we'll need to do a bit of an assessment to make sure you're healthy enough for the transition, and then I'll provide the necessary paperwork. It's not just about a simple "okay," but making sure the facility can properly care for any needs you might have. Let's start by talking about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe. The nurse, she tell me sometimes. I take the little white pill every morning. But… not so bad, you know? I feel good, mostly. No heart problems, I think. Never had that. And no… sugar problem either. I like sweet things, but… not too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. That's good to know. Do you remember the name of the medication, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Hmmm… the name… is a little hard. Is a small white pill, like I say. My husband, he get it for me. I think… it start with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? Sorry, Doctor. I am not good with names. The little white pill is all I remember. How many? One every morning, with my coffee.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Many people find medication names difficult to remember. We can look it up in your records if you’ve been getting it filled at the same pharmacy. But for now, let’s just say you take one white pill each morning for your blood pressure. Have you had any other health problems in the past?
PATIENT: I break my hip, long time ago. When I was… maybe 60? I fall down the stairs. Is fixed now, with the metal. But sometimes, it aches when is cold. And… I have a little trouble with my knees, too. Old age, you know? They make it hard to walk sometimes. Is not so bad, I still walk, but… slower.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a hip fracture repaired with metal and some current knee pain. And you said the knee pain slows you down a bit. Do you have any trouble with stairs, or other activities?
PATIENT: Stairs… yes, is harder now. I take them slow, and I hold on to the rail. And… walking long distances, is not good. I get tired quickly. I like to garden, but I can't do it for long. My husband, he help me now. He is a good man. But I still want to do things myself, you know? Is important.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's important to maintain your independence as much as possible. Let's talk a little bit about any other medical issues. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I had the baby, of course, but that was long ago. And I had the hip fixed, but that was just for a few days. Never been sick enough to stay in the hospital for long. Mostly just… little colds and things. Nothing serious. My husband, he always take care of me when I am sick. He make me soup and… rest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, regarding your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she have heart problems, when she get old. She take pills, like me. And my father, he have… I think is cancer, long time ago. But is a long time ago, when I was a little girl. My sister, she is healthy, I think. Never had much sickness. Is hard to remember, Doctor. So many years.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Just knowing about the heart problems and cancer is helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the white pill, mostly. Sometimes, when my knees hurt, I take the little orange one. For the pain. But not every day, only when is bad. And… sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take the little blue one. But not often, maybe once a week. My husband, he keep them for me. He know what I need. I forget the names, you see? They all look the same!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can look those up as well. So, to summarize, you take a white pill daily for blood pressure, an orange pill occasionally for knee pain, and a blue pill sometimes for sleep. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I eat everything! I like the spicy food, sometimes. My husband, he doesn’t like it so much, but I eat it anyway. No pollen, no nothing. I am lucky, I think. Never had any trouble with allergies. Is a good thing, you see?
DOCTOR: That is a good thing, Ms. Abdollahi. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never try it. And… I drink a little wine, sometimes. With my dinner. Just a small glass. My husband, he drink beer, sometimes too. But not every day. And… no, no drugs. Never had any trouble with those. Is not good for you, you see? My mother, she always tell me that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my knees, please. They are not so good, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that's not uncommon with a bit of stress in a doctor's office. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, can you bend your knees for me, so I can see how they are moving?
PATIENT: Ooh, that is a little hard. Is stiff, you see? And… it make a little cracking sound. Like that. Is always like that. Is just old age, I think.
DOCTOR: I feel some crepitus, which is that cracking sound you mentioned, and a little tenderness when I press here. Your range of motion is a bit limited, but that’s understandable given the stiffness and discomfort. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything else looks good.
PATIENT: That is good to hear, Doctor. So, what does it mean? Is my knees too bad? Can I still go to the old people place?
DOCTOR: Your knees have some arthritis, which is a common condition as we age. It explains the stiffness, cracking, and occasional pain. It's not severe enough to prevent you from going to the assisted living facility, but it's something we'll need to manage. Based on my exam and what you've told me, I believe you are healthy enough to transition, as long as the facility can accommodate your needs. We can discuss strategies for managing your knee pain, such as physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, or possibly a referral to an orthopedist if the pain worsens. I will also write a note to the facility detailing your medical history and any specific needs you may have. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. I am so glad to hear that. I just want to be comfortable, you see? And… still do things myself, as much as I can. The facility, they say they have help. And… if the pain get bad, I can see the other doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The facility can provide assistance when you need it, and if your pain does worsen, we can certainly schedule a referral to an orthopedist for further evaluation. We can also discuss some simple exercises you can do to help strengthen your knees and improve your mobility. I'm going to write a comprehensive note to the assisted living facility outlining your medical history, current medications, and any specific recommendations for your care. I'll also provide you with a summary of our visit and a list of resources for managing arthritis. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have been very kind. And… very patient. Thank you. I am so glad I came to see you. Now, can I go home and rest? My husband, he is waiting for me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm glad I could help. Absolutely, you can go home and rest. Here is a copy of the summary of our visit and the note for the assisted living facility. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And please give your husband my best. I hope you both have a peaceful afternoon. .
