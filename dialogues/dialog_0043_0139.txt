DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For… referee. Need paper say I okay. Want to be quick if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness-for-duty examination for refereeing. We can certainly accommodate that. To ensure I have a complete picture, even for a routine check, I’ll need to ask a few questions. It won’t take long, I assure you. First, let's talk about your overall health. Have you been feeling well recently?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. No… sick. Just… work. Work is hard. Lifting… heavy things. That is all.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, generally feeling well, no recent illnesses. And your work involves some heavy lifting. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me a bit more about the lifting?
PATIENT: Uh… bricks. Mostly. Special bricks. For… hot places. Very hot. Sometimes many. Sometimes… not so many. Depends on job. I try to be careful. Old job. Not strong like before.
DOCTOR: Okay, bricks for hot places. And you've noticed some decrease in your strength compared to previous work. That’s good you’re aware of that. To clarify, when you say "old job," are you currently employed doing this bricklaying, or is this a past profession?
PATIENT: Still do. But… less. Take more breaks now. Back… sometimes hurts. Not all the time. Just when… lift too much. Or bend funny.
DOCTOR: I see. You're still working with the bricks, but reducing the workload due to some back discomfort. You've pinpointed it to lifting and bending. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… dull. Not sharp. Like… tired muscle. Sometimes goes down leg. Not always. When I move wrong… it bad. Then go away. I rub it. Helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, sometimes radiating down the leg, brought on by certain movements and relieved somewhat by rubbing. That helps me get a clearer picture. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. No numb. Just… tired. Sometimes after long day. But not numb. Feel everything. I think.
DOCTOR: Good. No numbness or tingling. That’s reassuring. Now, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Doctor say I okay. Regular checkups. Just… work hard. Wife… she make me go. Before… she gone. No problems. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no previous medical diagnoses, and you’ve had regular checkups in the past. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. That must be difficult. Let’s move on to any surgeries or hospitalizations you may have had. Have you ever had any operations or been admitted to the hospital for any reason?
PATIENT: No. Never. Always healthy. Until… wife. No surgery. No hospital. Just… work. And… rest now. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Sometimes… pain pills. When back really bad. But not often. Just… when need. The blue ones. I think. Wife buy them. I don’t remember name.
DOCTOR: Okay, you occasionally use blue pain pills for back pain when needed. We can try to identify those later to ensure there aren’t any interactions or contraindications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had problem. I eat everything. Wife cook everything. No problem. She… good cook.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, finally, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Uh… mother… sick. Old. Heart. She gone long time ago. Father… strong. Work hard. Never sick. No cancer. No… I don’t know. Not much family now. Wife… her side… she take care of that. I don’t remember. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It's not always easy to recall family medical history. We have what we have. Now, to complete the assessment, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Do quick. I have things to do. Want to finish. Referee job… important. Need paper.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. It won't take long. Let's start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a few simple tests to assess your back and range of motion. Alright, your height is 174 centimeters, and your weight is 134 pounds. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your back. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little. Here. And when I bend. Like… this. That hurt. Not bad. Just… feels tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do note some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, and you're right, a slight forward bend does elicit some discomfort. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not significantly. Reflexes are normal. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you're experiencing some lower back strain, likely aggravated by your work. It doesn’t appear to be anything more serious at this time. However, it's important to manage it to prevent it from worsening. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. So… I okay for referee? Need paper. Can you write paper? Say I fit? That is all I need.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor. I can certainly provide a statement confirming your fitness for refereeing duties. However, I want to be thorough. While you appear generally fit, I would recommend some preventative measures to protect your back. I will note in the statement that you have been evaluated and are cleared for activity, with the recommendation for proper lifting techniques and regular stretching. Would you like me to include any specific limitations or recommendations, such as avoiding heavy lifting for a period of time?
PATIENT: No. No limitations. Just… be careful. I always careful. Just need paper. Thank you, Doctor. Quick visit. Good.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go, Mr. Shanor. This statement confirms your fitness for refereeing, with my recommendation for careful lifting techniques and regular stretching. I also want to provide you with a handout detailing proper lifting mechanics and some simple back stretches you can do at home. If your pain worsens or doesn’t improve within a week or two, please schedule a follow-up appointment, or consider consulting with a physical therapist. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Thank you. That is all. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself and be mindful of your back. Have a good day.
