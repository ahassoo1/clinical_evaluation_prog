DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, is it? Yes, well. It's a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. My daughter thinks I’m being dramatic, but a nice card from a real doctor would show her. It's just… a little boost, you know? Not that I’m actually sick sick.
DOCTOR: Okay… I understand. You’re hoping for a note, essentially, to show your daughter. Just to reassure her you're taking care of yourself. Is there anything specific you'd like me to mention in the note?
PATIENT: Oh, exactly! You get it. It’s the principle of the thing, really. She always thinks I worry too much. And honestly, a little encouragement wouldn't hurt. Hmm… you could say something about… preventative care? That I'm being proactive about my health. And maybe… that I'm very conscientious about looking after myself. Yes, that would be lovely. It’s important she understands I do think about these things, you know? Not just flitting about worrying!
DOCTOR: Preventative care and conscientious self-care… alright. Before I write that up, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about what prompted you to even think about preventative care in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it wasn’t anything specific. It's just… my cousin, her neighbour, he had a terrible thing happen. Heart, it was. And he hadn’t been to the doctor in years. My daughter, she used that as an example, of course. “See, Mum? This is what happens when you don't get check-ups!” Honestly, it’s all a bit dramatic. But it made me think, you know? I do try to eat well, I walk most days… that sort of thing. Though, honestly, these newfangled diets… I don’t understand half of them!
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like your cousin’s situation prompted some thought about your health, and you generally try to maintain a healthy lifestyle with diet and exercise. Just to get a better picture, have you had any specific health concerns lately, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that! Truly. It’s not like I’m ill. I had a bit of a twinge in my knee last week, but that was just from gardening, I expect. And my hands ache a bit sometimes, but I'm getting on, aren’t I? Sixty years takes its toll. It's more just… the general feeling of wanting to reassure my daughter that I'm on top of things, you see? She worries so much. Honestly, you wouldn't think I’d raised a perfectly sensible girl! Though she's very good at her job, I must say. Accountant, she is. Very precise. Unlike me, always flitting about.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're generally feeling well, just a little concerned about making sure your daughter understands you're proactive about your health. And you’re right, it’s good to be conscientious. Just to be complete, and since we’re talking about things, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of! I've always been quite healthy, really. Never been a sickly child, never had any major illnesses. I had the usual childhood things, measles and whatnot, but that was ages ago. Nothing serious. My mother, she had a bit of trouble with her digestion when she was older, but that’s hereditary, they say. And my father… well, he just wore himself out working, that’s all. Nothing you could diagnose, if that makes sense? Just hard work. A strong constitution, that's what I’ve always had. Though I do get a bit tired sometimes, of course. Sixty years… it’s a long time!
DOCTOR: Alright. No major illnesses, a family history of some digestive issues and a hardworking father… and you’re generally feeling well, just a bit of fatigue with age. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I've always avoided hospitals if I could. Not a fan, you see. Always full of germs and… well, sadness. I managed to avoid needing anything like that, thank goodness. A few stitches when I was a girl, climbing a tree and falling, but that was hardly a surgery! A little scrape and a bandage, that was all. And my daughter, she always tells me to be careful, you know? "Mum, you'll break a hip!" Honestly, she's such a worrier. But no, no surgeries. Definitely not. I believe in keeping things natural, if you know what I mean? Fresh air and a good walk. That's what keeps you going.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, and generally a focus on natural health practices. Just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I'm aware of! I rarely take anything, you see. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. And I've never had a reaction to anything. My daughter, she always asks if I’m allergic to anything when she gives me something, but I just tell her, "No, dear, I’m fine." Honestly, she treats me like I’m made of glass sometimes! A bit of a fussbudget, that girl. No allergies, though. Definitely not. A strong constitution, remember? I just get on with things. A bit of a walk, a cup of tea… that’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, no surgeries, and a generally healthy lifestyle. I do see here that you’re uninsured, and your clinic location is suburban. And your height is 176cm and weight is 55kg. I'm happy to write a note for your daughter reassuring her that you’re proactive about your health, focusing on preventative care and your conscientious approach to wellness. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor! Yes, please do. And thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me. It’s silly, I know, but it will mean a lot to my daughter, and to me. It’s just… nice to have a bit of reassurance, isn’t it? And a note from a real doctor will carry more weight, you see. Preventative care and conscientious wellness… yes, that’s perfect. You’re a very good listener, Doctor Beinborn. A very good listener indeed.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It says: "To Janeth’s Daughter, Janeth is very proactive about her health, focusing on preventative care and maintaining a conscientious approach to wellness. She is in good spirits. Sincerely, Dr. Jene Beinborn.” I hope this helps reassure her. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect! Absolutely perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. She'll be so pleased. Yes, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. Honestly, you’ve put my mind at ease, too. Just knowing someone has listened and understands… well, it’s very comforting. Thank you again. I’ll be sure to tell all my friends about you! A very good doctor, you are. A very good doctor indeed.
