DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tarin. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little… off in the right one too.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in the left leg, sometimes affecting the right. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, more like… a pins-and-needles sensation, and a sort of dull ache. It started, I believe, about three weeks ago, though it was very mild at first. I didn't think much of it – I spend a lot of time sitting while I work, so I assumed it was just from that. But it hasn’t gone away with changes in position, and it seems to be getting slightly worse. It’s most noticeable when I’m standing for a long time, or after I’ve been walking a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks, starting mild, now worsening, especially with standing and walking. And you said it's a pins-and-needles and dull ache. Does anything relieve it – like sitting, stretching, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Sitting does offer some temporary relief, yes. And… oddly enough, sometimes focusing intently on my work – when I'm really absorbed in animating – I don’t notice it as much. It’s not a solution, of course, just an observation. Stretching doesn’t seem to have much effect either way, unfortunately. I’ve tried a few basic stretches, but they haven't helped significantly.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting provides some temporary relief, and concentration seems to distract you from it. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s go a little broader. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs, or any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No, I haven't noticed any weakness, thankfully. And my balance seems to be fine. I walk normally, I haven’t tripped or anything like that. I did help a friend move some furniture last weekend – a fair amount of lifting and carrying – and I didn’t feel any different then, or have any trouble with stability. It’s mostly just the sensation of numbness, not any functional impairment.
DOCTOR: Good. No weakness or balance issues. Have you had any recent injuries to your back, legs, or feet?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I haven’t had any falls or significant bumps or anything like that. I occasionally strain my wrist from drawing for extended periods, but that's it, and that's been addressed with ergonomic adjustments to my workstation. My legs have been… uneventful, I suppose. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let’s talk about other medical issues. Do you have any other medical problems – like diabetes, or arthritis, or anything else that your doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I’ve always been fairly healthy, actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing chronic. I get a yearly check-up with my primary care physician, and everything has always been within normal ranges. I do have some seasonal allergies, but they’re well-managed with over-the-counter medication. I have private insurance, so I try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, healthy, yearly check-ups normal, seasonal allergies managed. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and thankfully no hospitalizations. I had my tonsils removed as a child, but that was… a long time ago. Other than that, I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. I try to be careful, and I generally avoid… risky activities. Animation tends to be a fairly safe profession.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. Do you take any medications regularly, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any regular medications. Just the occasional antihistamine during allergy season, as I mentioned. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. I try to get most of what I need from my diet. I eat a fairly balanced diet, mostly fish and vegetables, though I do enjoy the occasional indulgence. I suppose animation can be a sedentary profession, so I try to compensate with good eating habits.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional antihistamines. Let’s talk about family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, nerve problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother has mild arthritis in her hands, but it hasn’t been too debilitating. My father was generally very healthy, although he did have high blood pressure later in life, which was managed with medication. My maternal grandmother had some circulatory problems in her legs, but I don’t know the specifics. I don’t recall any other significant medical conditions within the family, to be honest. My family isn’t particularly large, and we’re not always the best at sharing medical information. Being Yupik, we’re a bit… private about those things sometimes. But nothing immediately springs to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with mild arthritis, father with high blood pressure, maternal grandmother with circulatory problems. Now, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I occasionally drink alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer with friends – but I don't drink heavily. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I prefer to keep a clear head for my work. Animation requires a fair amount of focus, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional alcohol, no recreational drugs. Okay, Tarin, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups in both legs. Now, let's check sensation… Okay, sensation is slightly diminished to light touch on the outer aspect of your left foot and lower leg compared to the right. And there's some mild allodynia – meaning a slight sensitivity to a normally non-painful stimulus – on that same area. No noticeable temperature or vibration deficits. Do you feel any discomfort with this exam?
PATIENT: No, I don't feel any particular discomfort. I did notice a slight tingling sensation when you touched the outer aspect of my left foot, but that’s not unusual – that’s where I usually feel the numbness. The rest of the exam was… unremarkable, I suppose. The tingling is more noticeable with pressure, like when you pressed with the cotton swab. It’s not painful, exactly, just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Your lower back feels normal – no tenderness or muscle spasms. Let's check your gait – just walk normally across the room and back. Your gait appears normal – no limping or instability. Based on the exam, the diminished sensation and allodynia on the outer aspect of your left leg, along with your history, it's suggestive of peripheral nerve irritation or compression. The most likely possibilities, given your description, are peroneal nerve entrapment, or possibly early signs of radiculopathy – a nerve root issue in your back. It’s unlikely, given the back exam, but not impossible. I’d like to order some further testing to help narrow down the diagnosis. Would you be willing to get an MRI of your lumbar spine, and nerve conduction studies of your lower extremities?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If those tests will help determine the cause of this numbness, I’m more than willing to undergo them. MRI and nerve conduction studies… I understand those are relatively common procedures? And they will help determine if it is a nerve root issue or something with the peroneal nerve specifically? I’m a little anxious about it, naturally, but I’d prefer to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, both are common procedures. The MRI will give us a detailed picture of your spine and look for any compression or inflammation of the nerve roots. Nerve conduction studies will assess how quickly signals are traveling along the nerves in your legs, which can help pinpoint the location and severity of any nerve damage. The results will help us differentiate between a nerve root issue – like a herniated disc – and a peripheral nerve problem, such as peroneal nerve entrapment. I'll send an order to the lab for both tests. They'll contact you to schedule appointments. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your symptoms – prolonged standing, walking long distances, or anything else that worsens the numbness. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – if you’re experiencing any discomfort. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies to medications. I can take ibuprofen or naproxen without issue. I understand avoiding aggravating activities and will definitely do so. So, to summarize, I’ll be contacted by the lab to schedule the MRI and nerve conduction studies, and I should avoid prolonged standing and walking until we have the results. And take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any specific symptoms I should monitor for in the meantime? Perhaps a worsening of the numbness, or the development of weakness?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're exactly right. Monitor for any worsening of the numbness, or the development of weakness in your leg or foot. Also, be on the lookout for any bowel or bladder changes – like difficulty urinating or loss of bowel control – as those could indicate a more serious nerve compression. While less likely, it's important to be aware of. If you experience any of those symptoms, or if the pain becomes severe and unmanageable with over-the-counter medication, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll review the results of the tests when they become available and discuss the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your detailed explanations and your attentiveness to my concerns. I’ll contact the lab to schedule the tests, and I will be mindful of the symptoms you’ve outlined. Thank you for your time and expertise. I’ll be in touch once I have the test results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And please, take care. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
