DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, welcome. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs, really. They just… gave out. Not all at once, you understand. It started a few days ago, after I had a terrible cold. Just felt weak, wobbly, you know? And now… well, walking is a bit of an ordeal. Honestly, I thought I was just getting old, but my daughter insisted I come see someone. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and wobbliness in your legs, starting a few days after a cold. I understand. It's good your daughter encouraged you to come in – it’s always best to check these things out. Can you tell me a little more about when exactly they started feeling weak?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… The cold itself ended, oh, maybe last Tuesday? Wednesday, definitely before the weekend. The weakness… it wasn’t immediate. It was gradual. I noticed it first when I was unloading groceries. Just a little unsteady, like I needed to hold onto the counter. I didn't think much of it, honestly. I’m a reasonably active person, you know, tour guide and all. Then it got a bit worse each day. Now, getting up from a chair takes real effort. And walking any distance… forget about it. I had to cancel a tour yesterday. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the weakness started a few days after the cold resolved, and has been gradually worsening since then. And it’s impacting your ability to do your job as a tour guide. That's important to know. And when you say "weak," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s not like… paralysis, if that makes sense. I can move them. It's just… heavy. Like trying to wade through thick mud. And wobbly. Very wobbly. Like my knees might buckle any second. It's in both legs, pretty much the same. And it's worse when I've been sitting for a bit. Getting going is the hardest part. It feels… strained. Not painful, not exactly, just… effortful. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy, wobbly, effortful, worse after sitting… and not painful. That’s helpful. And you said it's in both legs equally. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, not since the cold actually. No tingling or numbness. I haven't noticed any changes in my bladder or bowels, if you don’t mind me asking. Just… tired. Really tired, actually. But that could just be from worrying about the tour. And honestly, everything feels a bit more… slow, you know? My thinking, my reactions… it's like I'm wading through that mud again, but in my head. It’s not severe, though. It's probably just the stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no tingling or numbness, no changes in bladder or bowel function. Increased fatigue, and a sense of things being "slow," both physically and mentally. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have… had high blood pressure for a few years now. It's usually well controlled with medication, though. I see a doctor for that regularly. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago? No problems with that since. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk a lot for my job. But I do get anxious easily, if that matters. My daughter always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, gallbladder removed fifteen years ago, and a tendency towards anxiety. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20mg, once a day. And I sometimes take a little something for my anxiety if I have a particularly stressful tour coming up, but not regularly. Just a small dose of… lorazepam, I think it is? Maybe ten milligrams? Something like that. Honestly, I don't always remember the details. My daughter handles most of the prescription refills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, and lorazepam occasionally for anxiety. That’s helpful. Now, just one more quick set of questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. And I’ve certainly taken enough medications over the years, between colds and the blood pressure… if I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now, wouldn’t I? I suppose dust bothers me a little, like everyone, but it's not a real allergy. More of an annoyance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Sharifa, that’s a good overview. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. We'll check your reflexes, strength, and see how you’re walking. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with, please. I have a tour I need to reschedule, you know. And I really don't like being poked and prodded. My daughter always says I’m a terrible patient, but it’s just… I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll be as quick as possible. Okay, let's start with your reflexes. Please sit here on the edge of the table, and I’ll just tap a few places on your legs with this little hammer. This won't hurt, it's just to see how your nerves are responding. Okay, and now, could you try standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Ugh. See? It's awful. Like trying to walk through molasses. I told you. I need my legs for my job. This is… inconvenient. Very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. Your reflexes are… a bit diminished, and your strength is a little weaker than I'd expect, particularly when rising from a seated position. And yes, your gait is unsteady and requires effort. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. The weakness, combined with the fatigue and slow thinking, could be related to a number of things. It’s unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but it’s important to find out what’s going on. Do you mind if I order some blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Honestly, I thought you'd just give me something for my blood pressure and send me on my way. Fine. If you have to. But I have a tour next week that I absolutely cannot miss. Will the results take long? And will it interfere with my medication? I don't want to risk a crisis. My daughter will have a fit.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I assure you, we’ll try to keep everything as straightforward as possible. The blood work will help us rule out a few things - things like vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and any signs of inflammation or infection. It shouldn’t interfere with your Lisinopril, but we'll double-check with the lab just to be safe. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you take things easy, avoid strenuous activity, and stay well-hydrated. And, just to be on the safe side, I'm also going to order an MRI of your brain and spine. I know it sounds daunting, but it will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on, and help us pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI?! Now you're just trying to scare me! I read about those things. They're claustrophobic! And expensive! And what exactly are you looking for? My brain? My spine? This started as a bit of leg weakness after a cold, and now you’re talking about brain scans? Honestly, I think I need a second opinion. I really don’t like this at all. My daughter is going to be furious when she hears about this. She always says I worry too much, but this… this is ridiculous. Can’t you just… give me something stronger for my blood pressure? Maybe that will help.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Sharifa, and I want to assure you I’m not trying to scare you. I’m simply being thorough. The MRI isn’t meant to alarm you, it's simply the best way to rule out any serious underlying cause for your symptoms. We need to consider everything. The MRI machine is very open now, and we can absolutely provide medication to help you relax if you feel claustrophobic. And while increasing your blood pressure medication might temporarily mask some symptoms, it won’t address the underlying issue. We need to find out why you’re experiencing this weakness. Before we go any further, I want to explain the potential causes we are investigating. Your symptoms could be related to a variety of things - like a neurological issue, a vitamin deficiency, or even an autoimmune condition. The MRI and blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities and get you the right treatment. Would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Autoimmune condition? Neurological issue?! Now you’re just listing all the worst-case scenarios! Honestly, this is a disaster. I just wanted a simple explanation for my wobbly legs. Look, I’m not sure about the MRI. It sounds… awful. And I really don’t want to be poked and prodded any more than necessary. Can’t we just try the blood work first? See what that says? And maybe… maybe adjust my blood pressure medication slightly? I don’t want to spend the next week worrying about brain scans and autoimmune diseases. I have a tour to run, you know! Just the blood work. Please. And maybe a referral to a neurologist if the blood work shows something. But no MRIs. Not yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. I understand. We can certainly start with the blood work and see what that reveals. And we will absolutely hold off on the MRI for now. We’ll order a comprehensive blood panel to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. And I'll write a referral for you to see a neurologist, just to have them on standby. If the blood work shows anything concerning, or if your symptoms worsen, they can schedule a consultation. I'll also adjust your Lisinopril dosage slightly, as you requested, but please remember that it's unlikely to address the underlying cause. Do you have any questions about the blood work, the referral, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… alright. For now. Just please make sure the lab knows I don't like needles. And make sure the neurologist doesn’t try to scare me with all sorts of horrible diagnoses. I already worry enough. And could you write down the results when they come in? I tend to forget things, you know. My daughter handles most of my medical stuff, but she's on vacation this week, and I don't want to bother her. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sharifa. We’ll make a note in your chart about your needle phobia, and I’ll personally call you with the results as soon as they come in. We’ll also provide you with a written copy, and I can fax the results to your daughter when she returns from vacation. I'll also give you a printout of today’s discussion and a list of warning signs to watch out for – things like severe headache, difficulty speaking, or any weakness on one side of your body. If you experience any of those, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you… I suppose. I still think this is all a bit much for a bit of leg weakness, but… you seem very thorough. I just want to get back to normal, you know? Running tours, enjoying my life… Not worrying about autoimmune diseases and brain scans. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, even if I’m a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sharifa. And please, don’t worry about being a “terrible patient” – you’re just understandably concerned, and it’s my job to listen and address your worries. I'm confident we can figure out what’s going on and get you back to enjoying your life. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
