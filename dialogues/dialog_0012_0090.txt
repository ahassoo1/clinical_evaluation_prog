DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… very nice to meet you as well. Um, well, I’m here for a clearance. A pre-surgery clearance, that is. For… cosmetic surgery. It’s all a bit much to keep straight, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative clearance for cosmetic surgery. No problem at all, we want to make sure everything is safe before you proceed. To start, can you tell me what type of surgery you’re planning on having, and with which surgeon?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The… type. It was… something with my stomach. To tighten things up, I think? And the surgeon… Dr. Alvarez, I believe? Yes, Dr. Alvarez. At the City Center Surgical Suite. It was recommended to me by… a friend, I think. It’s all rather hazy, truthfully. I apologize. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly fine to not remember every detail. We can sort it out together. So, an abdominal surgery with Dr. Alvarez at City Center Surgical Suite. Good. That gives me a place to start. Before we go further, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… well, generally, I’m quite healthy, I believe. I try to eat well, mostly. I do landscaping work, so I’m… fairly active. Though, admittedly, it’s been a bit harder lately. I get tired more easily. As for… serious illnesses, I don’t believe I’ve had any. I lost my husband a few years back, and… things have been a little unsettled since then. That’s probably a rather long answer, I apologize. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful information, Mackenzi. I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It’s completely understandable that things have been unsettled since then, and stress can absolutely impact your health. You mentioned getting tired more easily. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like a sudden collapse, Doctor. More like… a gradual wearing down throughout the day. I used to be able to work all day without much trouble, pruning bushes, planting flowers… now, I have to take several breaks. And even then, I just feel… drained. It's hard to explain. It’s not painful, just… heavy. And it seems to be getting worse, slowly. I find myself needing to rest more in the evenings, and I haven’t been sleeping as soundly either.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue that’s gradually worsening, impacting your ability to work, and some difficulty with sleep. That’s good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little… breathless, I suppose. Not with exertion, usually. More like… just catching my breath after talking, sometimes. And… oh! My ankles have been a bit swollen lately, especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just from being on my feet so much, but… perhaps not? I really am sorry if I’m being vague. I wish I could recall things more easily.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being vague at all, Mackenzi. These details are very helpful. Breathlessness and ankle swelling are important to note. Let's go through some basic questions to get a fuller picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never really had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No allergies to food, no medication sensitivities… nothing that I can recall, at least. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant rash once from poison ivy, but that hardly counts, does it?
DOCTOR: No, poison ivy doesn’t count! That’s good to know about the allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. I take one every morning, just to be safe. And… occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, if it gets really bad. But that’s very infrequent. Perhaps once a month, if that. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I’m not fond of taking pills, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good. Now, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s a little difficult. I’ve always been quite healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox… but nothing serious. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. And… oh! I had a rather nasty fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But it healed well, no lasting problems. I don't recall any chronic illnesses, like diabetes or heart problems, or anything of that nature. I really haven’t had much need for doctors, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, routine childhood illnesses, tonsillectomy, and a past wrist fracture. No chronic medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries other than the tonsillectomy and wrist fracture repair?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think carefully. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall. I’ve never been one for surgeries, if I can avoid them. The wrist fracture was quite unpleasant, and I’ve been hesitant ever since. Nothing else comes to mind… unless… oh! A wisdom tooth removal, years ago. But that was a very simple procedure, hardly a surgery, was it?
DOCTOR: Wisdom tooth removal counts! Okay, so tonsillectomy, wrist fracture repair, and wisdom tooth removal. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question, Doctor. My family wasn’t very forthcoming about health matters, to be honest. My mother… she passed away when I was young. And my father… he wasn't one for sharing. I know my grandmother had… something with her heart, I believe. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, had cancer, many years ago. But beyond that, I’m really not sure. It wasn't something we discussed much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s common for families to not openly discuss health history. Knowing about grandmother’s heart condition and aunt’s cancer is helpful, though. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, as I mentioned earlier, I’m widowed. My husband, Eduardo, passed away a few years ago. It was… sudden. I live alone now, in a small house in the suburbs. I work as a landscaper, mostly tending to gardens. It keeps me busy. I don’t have much family nearby, and… I haven’t really made many new friends since Eduardo passed. It’s… lonely, sometimes. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I try to stay active, but… it’s been difficult lately.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Mackenzi. It sounds like you've been through a lot. It's completely understandable that you've been feeling lonely and finding it difficult to stay motivated. Thank you for sharing that with me. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I just… I do hope it’s nothing serious. But I understand it’s best to be thorough. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… Your heart sounds regular, but a little… faint. Your lungs sound clear, but I do notice your breathing is a little shallow. Now I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 135/85. Pulse is 88, also a little on the higher side. I notice some mild swelling in both ankles, as you mentioned. Your nailbeds look a little pale. Finally, I’m going to take a quick look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks normal, and your ears are clear. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your fatigue, breathlessness, ankle swelling, and pale nailbeds, along with the slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse, could be indicative of a few different possibilities. I want to order some blood work and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Anything that might help. I just… I do hope it's not anything too serious. I feel rather… anxious now. But if that’s what you recommend, then please, go ahead. Whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi. I understand your anxiety, and we will figure this out. The blood work will check for things like anemia, thyroid function, kidney and liver function, and inflammation. The EKG will check your heart's electrical activity. I’ll have the lab technician draw a few vials of blood, and then we’ll do the EKG right here in the office. It's a quick and painless procedure—just some stickers on your chest and a recording of your heart's rhythm. It should take about 30-45 minutes altogether. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity and try to get plenty of rest. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… clear enough. Blood work, EKG, avoid strenuous activity, rest, and… emergency room if anything changes. I will remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your… care. Where… where do we start with the blood work?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab technician, Maria, is just outside the door. I've already let her know you’re ready. She’ll come in, confirm your name and date of birth, and then take the blood samples. It's usually a quick process. She’ll need you to sit in that chair over there, and she'll use a tourniquet to help find your vein. It might sting a little when she inserts the needle, but it shouldn’t be painful for long. Let me just jot down a few notes about our conversation and then I'll step outside and let her know you're ready. Do you have any questions before I call Maria in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very… clearly. I’m a little nervous, of course, but… I trust you and Maria. I’ll just… try to relax. Thank you again for your patience.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi. That’s good. Just try to take deep breaths, like you’re doing now. Maria, could you come in here and draw some blood for Mackenzi Brightful?
PATIENT: Hello. It’s… nice to meet you. I’m ready when you are.
