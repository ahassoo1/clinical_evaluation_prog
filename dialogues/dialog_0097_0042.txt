DOCTOR: Hi Londell, good to see you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Georgiou, good to meet you too. I appreciate you takin’ the time. I saw the ad about men’s health… optimization, was it? Truth is, I'm gettin’ up there in years and want to make sure everything’s still workin’ like it should, you know? Just want to feel my best for as long as possible. My wife, bless her heart, always said I worried too much, but… well, she’s gone now, and I reckon it’s up to me to look after things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Londell. It's very proactive of you to think about this now. And it's perfectly normal to want to feel your best, especially as we get older. It sounds like you're looking for a general check-up and maybe some guidance on maintaining your health. We can definitely do that. Let's start with a bit of your history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor recently?
PATIENT: I have, for the most part. Old Doc Hemlock, back in town. Good man, but he retired a couple years back. Haven’t really found anyone to replace him since. Been doin’ yearly physicals with him up 'til then. Had bloodwork done, the usual. Nothing major ever came up, thankfully. I've got a little arthritis in my hands, but that's about it. Used to be pretty active, did a lot of hiking, but slowed down a bit since my wife passed. It just didn't feel right goin’ out there by myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, yearly physicals with Dr. Hemlock, up until his retirement. Arthritis in the hands, that's helpful. And it sounds like grief has understandably impacted your activity level. That’s completely normal, and we can talk about that too, if you'd like. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about this arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly in my knuckles and the base of my thumbs. Gets stiff in the mornin', especially if it’s cold or damp. Doesn’t really hurt bad, just… achy and makes it hard to do detailed work. See, I’m an etcher, do a lot of engraving. Requires a steady hand, and it’s gettin’ harder. I've been tryin' to manage it with some over-the-counter stuff, liniments and such. Helps a little, but not like it used to. I haven't really done much about it beyond that, figured it was just part of gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knuckles and base of the thumbs, worse in the mornings and with cold weather. It's impacting your engraving work. And you’ve been managing it with over-the-counter liniments. That’s good you've been trying to stay on top of it. Now, let's talk about your overall health a bit. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. Broke my arm once fallin’ out of a tree, but healed up fine. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, I reckon. Always ate pretty healthy – my wife was a good cook, focused on fresh food. And I never smoked, never really cared for it. Drank a little whiskey now and then, socially, but nothing heavy. Still do, occasionally, a small glass with supper. Mostly just water these days, though.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Londell. A clean medical history is a great starting point. Tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm that healed well, no other major illnesses or surgeries, and a healthy lifestyle overall. That's fantastic. No smoking and only occasional, moderate alcohol use is also very good. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, later in life. And her mother, my grandma, had… well, I think it was diabetes. Type 2, I believe. On my father's side, he had some heart trouble, nothing major, but he did have to watch his cholesterol. That's about all I can recall, to be honest. My family wasn't much for talkin’ about health issues, kept things pretty private. I don't really know much beyond that. It's possible there was more, but I just wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure in your mother, Type 2 diabetes in your grandmother, and heart trouble in your father. That's helpful to know, thank you. It's not uncommon for families to be private about these things. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter liniment for my hands, like I said. And I take a multivitamin, mostly just to be safe. Nothing fancy, just a standard one I picked up at the drugstore. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really botherin' me, I'll take some ibuprofen. But not regularly, just when I need it. That’s about it. I don’t really like takin’ pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so over-the-counter liniment, a multivitamin, and occasional ibuprofen for your arthritis. Good to know you prefer to avoid medication when possible. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I’ve had a few bee stings over the years, but nothin’ more than a little swellin’. My wife always said I was lucky that way, didn’t have the sensitivities some folks do. I’ve never had any trouble with penicillin or any of those common allergies. I think I'd remember if I did!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Londell. No known allergies. Alright, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just the usual – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a bit. I've always figured a good check-up is a good thing. And I trust your judgement, of course. Just let me know if anything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you'll just hop up on the table here, we'll get started. Okay, your blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not significantly so. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. No signs of infection or excessive wax buildup. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly noted. Pulses are strong and regular in all extremities. I do see some slight swelling and bony prominence in your knuckles, consistent with arthritis. It doesn’t appear to be severe, but we can discuss some strategies to manage the pain and improve your function. Alright, that completes the quick physical exam. Everything seems generally good, but we will need to do some blood work to get a more complete picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I appreciate you takin' the time to look me over. And yes, my hands have been botherin' me a bit more lately, so anything you can suggest would be greatly appreciated. I mostly just want to keep doin’ what I enjoy, and that means bein’ able to work with my hands.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, and that’s a very reasonable goal. We’ll definitely work towards that. The blood work will give us a baseline to assess your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. It will also help us rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. I’ll also order a sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to get a better idea of the inflammation in your body related to the arthritis. While we wait for those results, we can discuss some lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter options to help manage your arthritis pain. There are also some physical therapy exercises you can try to improve your hand function and range of motion. Would you like me to give you some information on those now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. Any information you can give me about exercises or ways to ease the pain would be greatly appreciated. I've been tryin' to avoid too much stress on my hands, but I haven’t really done any focused exercises. And I'm always open to learnin' new ways to manage things. I reckon it's never too late to start takin' better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s a handout with some gentle hand exercises you can start with. These are designed to improve your range of motion and strengthen the muscles in your hands. Remember to start slowly and stop if you feel any pain. This handout also details some ways to protect your joints. Things like using larger tools with thicker grips, avoiding repetitive motions, and taking frequent breaks. Warm water soaks can also help to ease the pain and stiffness. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can be helpful for managing pain, but it's important to use them as directed and avoid long-term use. We can also discuss topical creams or gels, like those containing capsaicin, which can help to reduce inflammation. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: No, that's all pretty clear, Doctor. Thank you. The exercises look manageable, and I appreciate the tips about protectin' my joints. I hadn't really thought about that much, to be honest, just tryin' to avoid doin' things that hurt. And I'm careful about takin' pills, don't want to rely on 'em if I can help it. Capsaicin… isn’t that in peppers? I do enjoy a bit of spice, but I don't know if I want to rub peppers on my hands!
DOCTOR: You are correct, it is derived from peppers! But don't worry, it's a very refined form and doesn't feel like rubbing peppers on your hands. It works by desensitizing the nerves in the area, which can help to reduce pain. It does take a few days of consistent use to see results, and some people experience a mild burning sensation at first. But it's a relatively safe and effective option for many people. We can certainly discuss other options if that doesn't appeal to you. Now, regarding your blood work, I’ll get the order sent to the lab, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a more comprehensive plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that all sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. And I will definitely call if anything changes. I reckon I'm in good hands with you, so to speak! I’m lookin’ forward to gettin’ those results back and seein’ what we can do. Thank you again for your time and help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Londell. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And I will, I promise.
