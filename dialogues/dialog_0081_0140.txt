DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… rather unpleasant. It’s in my mouth. A white coating. It’s not… dignified, to be frank. I assumed it was something easily remedied. I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: A white coating, you say. And how long has this… undignified coating been present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A few days, perhaps? It’s difficult to say precisely. I don’t spend a great deal of time examining my mouth, naturally. It’s more of a… general discomfort. It makes eating rather unpleasant, and my wife has been… hinting that it's not particularly appealing to look at. Though frankly, she worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Right. A few days. And is this discomfort constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It’s worse with certain foods, certainly. Anything sweet makes it… more noticeable. And it feels a bit… rough, if I’m being honest. Not painful, just… irritating. I had a rather nice piece of flan yesterday, and it was… quite unpleasant afterward. Though, I shouldn't have had it, probably. It's not exactly health food.
DOCTOR: Flan. Yes, well. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. No, not really. Perhaps a bit… tired, but that’s probably just life, isn’t it? I work hard, Doctor. Felling trees is not a sedentary occupation. It’s not as if I’m lounging about eating flan all day, despite what it may seem. My wife is always telling me to rest, but… well, you know. A man’s got to provide.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any fever, chills, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And swallowing… no, not difficulty, exactly. It’s just… uncomfortable, as I said. It feels a bit scratchy. And honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining about a bit of scratchiness. I’ve endured far worse in my line of work. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it. I have a schedule to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There is a patchy white coating on your tongue and the inner cheeks. No visible ulcers or bleeding. It appears to be thrush – a fungal infection. It’s not uncommon, particularly if your immune system is slightly compromised, or if you’ve been taking antibiotics recently. Have you taken any antibiotics lately?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? No, not recently. I haven't been ill, not properly. Just the usual aches and pains from the work, you understand. And what does “compromised” mean? I assure you, I’m a perfectly healthy man for my age. Perhaps it’s just the humidity? It's been dreadful lately.
DOCTOR: Humidity doesn’t cause thrush, Mr. Schieber. Now, while it's possible you have a minor immune system fluctuation that we're not aware of, it's also common in individuals with poor oral hygiene or those who use certain medications. Do you regularly use any inhalers, or mouthwash?
PATIENT: Inhalers? No. Mouthwash… occasionally. My wife buys it. Some fancy brand with fluoride, I suppose. I don’t pay much attention. It tastes rather… medicinal. I prefer a good, strong coffee, if I’m honest. Look, Doctor, is this something serious? Because frankly, I don’t have time for… complicated illnesses.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious, Mr. Schieber, but it’s certainly not something you want to ignore. It can be quite uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can spread. I'm going to prescribe you an antifungal mouthwash. Rinse with it twice a day for two weeks. And, I strongly advise improving your oral hygiene. Brush twice a day, floss, and limit sugary foods and drinks. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Mouthwash, twice a day. Very well. And less sugar. I suppose I can manage that. But two weeks? It seems rather… excessive. Look, is there anything else? I really must be going. I have a crew waiting for me. And the cost of this… mouthwash? I haven't got insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Two weeks is the standard course of treatment, Mr. Schieber. Skipping doses or stopping early can lead to recurrence. As for the cost... I’ll write you a prescription for a generic brand. It should be relatively inexpensive. There are also over-the-counter options, though I wouldn’t recommend them as a first line of defense. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with anything, to be frank. I eat everything. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Simple tastes, simple constitution. Look, is that it? Can I go now? This whole process has been… rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Here. Take this to a pharmacy. Follow the instructions carefully. And if the condition doesn't improve within a week, or if it worsens, I expect you to return for a re-evaluation. Otherwise, I believe that concludes our consultation.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, it hasn't been a particularly… pleasant experience. Humidity, indeed. .
