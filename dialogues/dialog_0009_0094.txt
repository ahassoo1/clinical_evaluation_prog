DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh... good morning. Yes. My husband... he made me come. Something about... learning? I work with metal, you see. Very strong metal. Not much time for... this. I don't really remember what he said, exactly. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It sounds like you're quite busy. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Your husband is thoughtful to want you to get checked out. It doesn't have to take long at all, and we’ll focus on what’s most important. Just to clarify, when your husband says “learning,” is he concerned about a specific symptom or health issue?
PATIENT: Symptom? No... not really. He just keeps saying I should know more about... things. Like, what happens if... something breaks? I lift heavy things. Lots of bending. Sometimes my back... feels stiff. But it's always been like that. Is that a symptom? I don't know what he's talking about, honestly. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about potential issues related to your work, with the heavy lifting and bending. Back stiffness is certainly something we can talk about, and it's good you mentioned it. It can be a sign of something, but it also can be just part of the job. To help me understand a little better, can you describe the stiffness?
PATIENT: Describe? It... hurts. When I stand up too fast. Or if I've been bending a long time. It's not... sharp. Just… achy. Like a really old, tired muscle. It goes away after a while if I move around. But it's always there, a little bit. And sometimes, when I lift something really heavy, I feel it in my shoulders too. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the words for these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Achy” and “old tired muscle” are very helpful descriptions. And it’s good to know it's better with movement and affects your shoulders sometimes. That gives me a clearer picture. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Work... well, I cut metal. Big sheets of metal. And bend it. And sometimes weld it. It's... loud. And dirty. I’ve been doing it for... a long time. Maybe ten years? I don’t remember exactly. We make... things for buildings. You know, the walls, the roof. Heavy stuff. I lift a lot. Mostly with my back. We don’t have fancy machines. Mostly just... me and my hands. And my back, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ten years of cutting, bending, and welding, lifting heavy metal without a lot of machinery. That’s very physically demanding work. It sounds like you’re quite strong! Let’s talk a little about your overall health. Have you had any other aches or pains besides your back?
PATIENT: Other aches? Hmm... not really. Sometimes my hands are a little sore, but that's just from the metal. And... I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired. I don’t really get sick. I haven't been to a doctor in... a long time. I don't like doctors. They always tell you not to do things. And I need to work. Can't be sick. That's not an option. Is this all they ask here? It’s taking up my time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good that you generally feel healthy, and I respect your need to stay healthy for work. We'll try to be as quick as possible, and I promise not to tell you to stop doing what you need to do. We just want to make sure everything is as safe as possible. Before we move on, just a few quick questions. Have you ever had any serious injuries?
PATIENT: Injuries... hmm. Nothing serious. I’ve cut myself a few times, little cuts. And I’ve twisted my ankle once, but it healed. My husband always tells me to be careful. He worries too much. I've burned myself a little with the welding, but nothing bad. Just little things. I’m strong. I can handle it. Is that what you want to know? If I’m broken or something? I’m not broken.
DOCTOR: No, I just want to get a full picture. “Little cuts and burns” are still important to know. It sounds like you've been very careful and resilient. Alright. Let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had problems with their back, or any other health issues that run in the family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had… something with her bones. When she got old. I don’t remember exactly what. She lived far away. We didn’t see her very often. My father… he was strong. Always working. Never sick. He died… a long time ago. I don't really know about their health. We didn’t talk about things like that. Is this important? I feel like you’re asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don’t know much about your family’s health history. It’s common. Knowing something can sometimes be helpful, but it’s not always essential. One last few questions about you. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't take medicine. Never have. And I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I eat everything. I need the energy for work, you see. I can't be sick. That would be... bad. Is that all? Can I go now? I have things to do. I'm wasting time here. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies and no medications. That’s good to know. Alright, Airam. I think I have enough information for now. Before we finish, I would like to do a quick physical examination, just to get a better understanding of your back and shoulders. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examination? You want to… touch me? No. Absolutely not. I don't like that. I’m fine. I told you, I’m strong. I can feel everything. I don't need you to poke and prod. My husband made me come here for… learning. Not for you to touch me. No. I'm leaving now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. I completely understand and respect your wishes. You are absolutely right to say no if you’re uncomfortable. We can absolutely skip the physical examination. It sounds like your husband is concerned about your health given the physical demands of your work. Based on what you've told me, you're generally healthy, strong, and don't have any allergies or medical conditions. However, given the back stiffness, I do recommend some preventative measures to help protect your back and shoulders. Would you be open to discussing some exercises and proper lifting techniques?
PATIENT: Exercises? Lifting techniques? I’ve been lifting metal for ten years. I know how to lift. My husband probably told you I don’t know how. He always thinks I need help. But… I guess… I could listen. But no touching. And keep it short. I have things to do. I don't have time for a long lecture.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No touching, I promise. And it will be brief. We'll focus on a few simple things. Okay, so you've been lifting metal for ten years. That means you've developed a lot of strength and experience. The goal isn't to change how you lift, but to reinforce good habits and minimize strain. One key thing is to keep the load close to your body. The further away the metal is, the more stress on your back. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Close to the body… yes. I do that. Most of the time. It's easier to control. But sometimes… the metal is big. Awkward shapes. It’s hard to keep it close. My husband always tells me to be careful. He worries too much. Is that what you’re going to tell me? To be careful?
DOCTOR: It is important to be careful, but it sounds like you already are careful and aware of the challenges with awkward shapes. And yes, you’re right – your husband probably tells you that a lot! Okay, so let's talk about how to manage those awkward shapes. When lifting something heavy and unwieldy, try to bend your knees and keep your back straight. Use your leg muscles to do most of the lifting, not your back. And it's okay to ask for help, even if it's just to stabilize the load. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Knees… yes. I try to bend my knees. But sometimes… I forget. It’s fast. I need to be quick. And asking for help… is embarrassing. I’m strong. I can do it myself. But… okay. I’ll try to remember to bend my knees. And maybe… ask for help if it’s really heavy. But no promises.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Airam. You don’t need to make promises. Just being aware of these things is a big step. And it’s okay to forget sometimes – we all do. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s to minimize strain over time. One last thing. Pay attention to your body. If you feel any sharp pain, stop immediately. Don’t push through it. And if the pain doesn’t go away, see a doctor or physical therapist. Would you be open to getting a referral to a physical therapist, just in case?
PATIENT: Sharp pain… yes. I know sharp pain. That's bad. I stop. Always. Referral… a physical therapist? What do they do? More poking and prodding? No. I don't want a referral. I’m fine. I just need to get back to work. I think… that’s enough learning for today. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. No referral, and we won’t do any poking and prodding. I understand. Just remember to listen to your body, try to keep the load close, bend your knees, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. Here’s a handout with some basic lifting techniques and exercises. I wish you all the best at work, and please, don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Airam. .
