DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Seil, it’s… a delicate matter, really. Something a woman doesn’t often discuss. It's about… my friend’s husband. He's been… having a bit of a problem, and she thought it best to come in and get a professional opinion. It's rather embarrassing, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. You're doing the right thing by seeking medical advice, and I assure you, anything you share with me will be kept strictly confidential. It's perfectly normal for these things to be sensitive. Just to clarify, you're seeking medical attention on behalf of your friend's husband?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. He… well, he wouldn’t come himself. Too much pride, you see. And frankly, I think he's a bit… ashamed. It's a… discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I’m being honest. She’s terribly worried. It's not… normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s certainly not normal, Ms. Wartick, and you're right to be concerned. A discharge is a sign something isn’t right. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it’s… yellowish-green, I believe. And rather… thick. Not watery, thankfully. She says it sometimes has a bit of an… odor. A bad one. It's been going on for… oh, I suppose a week or so now. He hasn’t mentioned any pain, but he is a man, you understand. They don't tend to complain easily. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful information, Ms. Wartick. The color, consistency, and presence of odor are all important clues. And yes, men often don't report symptoms as readily as women do. Has he noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, she did say he’s been… going to the bathroom more frequently. Not a great deal more, but… noticeable. And a bit of burning when he… finishes. She wasn't very specific, if you understand. Honestly, I’m doing my best to extract information from him secondhand, and it's proving… difficult. He just grumbles and says it's "nothing." Is that concerning, Doctor? It sounds like a simple irritation, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Increased frequency and burning sensation are definitely things we need to investigate further, Ms. Wartick. While it could be a simple irritation, those symptoms can also indicate a more serious underlying issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about his medical history, if that’s alright with you. Have you or your friend ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, that’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? I certainly hope not! We are… respectable people. I can assure you, Doctor, neither of us has ever engaged in… that sort of behavior. It’s simply… unthinkable! But, to be perfectly honest, I don’t know about his entire past. He doesn't share everything, you see. Are you suggesting… something untoward? It’s a bit… upsetting to even consider.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was too direct, Ms. Wartick. It was not my intention to cause any offense or imply anything untoward. I simply need to rule out all possibilities to ensure we arrive at the correct diagnosis. It's a standard part of the evaluation process. Regardless, we’ll proceed with caution. Has he had any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. He's a bit… stout, perhaps, but generally healthy. As for prostate problems… well, he's a man of a certain age. He complains of getting up at night to… relieve himself, but he just attributes it to his age. He doesn't go to the doctor much, you see. Thinks it's a waste of time. Honestly, he's very stubborn. Are you sure this isn't just a minor inconvenience? Perhaps a bit of irritation from… shaving? He's very particular about his appearance.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Frequent urination can be related to several things, and the fact that he doesn’t see a doctor regularly makes gathering information more challenging. While shaving irritation can sometimes cause discharge, the yellow-green color and odor you described are less typical of that, and it warrants further investigation. Ms. Wartick, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a physical exam. It will involve checking his temperature, pulse, and a brief examination of the affected area. It’s the best way to assess the situation and determine the next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness! A physical exam? You want to… examine him? I don't think that's necessary, Doctor. And frankly, I’m not sure he would approve. I came here to get your opinion, not to have… well, everything laid bare! Surely, there's another way? Perhaps some sort of… medication? Or a cream? I really think you're overreacting. It sounds like a simple irritation. I'm sure it will clear up on its own. I think I'll just take his word for it. It's really not a big deal. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, my intention is only to provide the best possible care. However, without a proper examination, it's difficult to accurately diagnose the cause of the discharge and recommend the appropriate treatment. Given the symptoms you've described, it's important to rule out potentially serious infections that require specific medication. A physical exam is the most reliable way to do that. If he is unwilling to be examined, I strongly recommend he see a urologist. They specialize in these types of issues and can provide a more thorough evaluation. I can provide you with a referral if you’d like. I understand your discomfort, and I respect your wishes, but I cannot provide a diagnosis or prescribe medication without further information. Ultimately, his health is the priority. .
