DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, alright. I am here because… well, I have been having trouble breathing. It is a… a whistling sound when I breathe out.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound, you say. How… long has this been occurring, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe… two weeks now? Perhaps a little longer. It comes and goes, you see. Not all the time. Sometimes it is worse when I walk, or… when I am doing things.
DOCTOR: "Comes and goes," right. And is this… whistling sound accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my chest feels tight. Not painful, exactly. Just… squeezed. And I get a little tired, quicker than usual. I do not know if that is from the breathing, or just… getting older.
DOCTOR: "Getting older." Yes, well. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… now that you mention it… yes. A little. Just at the end of the day, usually. I thought it was from standing too long when I am helping my grandson with his garden.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any history of… heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. My father had high blood pressure, I think. But I have always been quite active. I used to be a trainer, you see. For the school teams. I keep myself moving.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I had a reaction to some cream once, many years ago. It made my skin very itchy. I do not remember what it was called. And… I think I was a little sick after taking some pills for a cold, but that was a long time ago too.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. It is… a white pill. I take it every morning. Helps with the pain in my hands. And sometimes I take something for my stomach, if it is bothering me.
DOCTOR: And what is the name of this… medication for your arthritis, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. My grandson helps me with my pills, he knows the names. I… I really do not remember. It comes in a little orange bottle.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s move on to a quick physical examination, then. Please, if you would, take a seat on the examination table. I need to listen to your lungs and heart.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds good. I hope it will not take too long.
DOCTOR: It won’t. Now, if you could just breathe deeply through your mouth… Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels… strange to breathe so deeply.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is fine. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Deep breath, please. And exhale. Again. Your heart sounds… somewhat irregular. And I do detect some wheezing in your lungs.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Irregular? That does not sound good. Is that… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Given your age and these findings, I suspect you may be experiencing some degree of… congestive heart failure and possibly some underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, it's premature to jump to conclusions. We'll need some tests.
PATIENT: Congestive… what? And pulmonary… that sounds very scary. What kind of tests, Doctor? Will they be… painful?
DOCTOR: It's not scary, Mrs. Kilton. It's simply a matter of gathering information. We'll need a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram – that's a simple heart tracing – and some blood work to assess your kidney function and check for inflammation. The X-ray is painless, the EKG involves some stickers on your chest, and the blood work… well, it's a needle prick. Not pleasant, but hardly excruciating. I'll order those now.
PATIENT: A needle prick… oh dear. I do not like needles very much. Will it take long to get the results, Doctor? And… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: The results should be available within a few days, Mrs. Kilton. And if it is something serious – which, again, is not a certainty – we will discuss treatment options. Those might include medication, pulmonary rehabilitation, or, in some cases, referral to a specialist. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for a bronchodilator to help ease your breathing in the meantime. It's a standard treatment for wheezing. Do you have any questions before I conclude?
PATIENT: A broncho… what? Will that… medicine help right away? And… will it interact with the pill I take for my arthritis? I do not want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: The bronchodilator, Mrs. Kilton, will help open your airways and make breathing easier. It should provide some relief within a few hours. As for interactions, it’s unlikely to interfere with your arthritis medication, but I will flag your medication list in your chart. Here is the prescription. Take it to your local pharmacy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the test results. Do you have any other urgent concerns?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope it is nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the checkout. Please schedule that follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you… I hope it is nothing too serious… .
