DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t got all day. It’s my stool, see? It’s…black. Been happening for a bit now. And I take pills, you know, for the aches. The regular kind, what everyone takes. Is that what you need to know? Because frankly, I don't see what else it could be.
DOCTOR: Black stool, alright. And you’ve noticed this for…how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… not a week, certainly. Maybe… three weeks? It comes and goes, not every single day, thankfully. But it’s definitely been happening on and off for about three weeks, I’d say. Honestly, it’s just unsettling. And I told you, it’s these pills I’m on. They have to be doing something. Are you going to test me for something, or…?
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of intermittent black stools. And you suspect it’s related to your medications. Can you tell me the name of those medications, Dawnetta?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. You want me to remember the name? Honestly. Well, they're the little white ones... the round ones. I get them from the pharmacy, of course! I take them for my joints, you know, the aches and pains. My husband gets them for me. He knows the name, probably. I just take two every morning with my breakfast. Look, are you a doctor or a pharmacist? I just want to know why my stool is black!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. It is important to know the specific medications you’re taking, even the little white ones, as some can cause changes in stool color. While some medications can cause dark stools, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly! No, not really. Just the… the stool. I’m tired, but who isn't? I’m seventy-three years old! I get a bit winded when I go up the stairs, but that's just age, I think. No stomach pain, no… nothing like that. Just the black stool. I really don't understand what the fuss is about. Are you going to poke and prod me now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, Dawnetta. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'd like to check your vitals. It won’t be much poking and prodding, I promise. It helps me get a better picture of what's going on. Could you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod. Honestly, I knew it. Fine, fine. But don’t expect me to be comfortable. I have a bad back, you know. And make it quick, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular. I’m not detecting any tenderness in your abdomen, and it doesn’t feel distended. I also don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any issues with bleeding, like nosebleeds or bleeding gums?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Goodness, no. Not really. I mean, I get a little cut now and then, like everyone does, but nothing major. I’ve never had a nosebleed in my life, that I can remember. My gums don't bleed when I brush my teeth. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person, considering my age. It’s just this… stool. This ridiculous black stool. I just want to know what’s causing it and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the color?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… no, not really. It’s pretty much the same as always, honestly. Sometimes a little harder, sometimes a little softer, you know. But nothing dramatic. No diarrhea, no… problems going. Just…normal, except for the color. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Are you going to run some tests, or are you just going to keep asking me questions all day? I have a bingo game tonight!
DOCTOR: You’re right, Dawnetta. We should investigate this further. I’m going to order a stool test to check for blood. Also, a complete blood count, just to make sure everything is as it should be. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with. And don't expect me to come back if it's something complicated. My husband will have to take me, and he hates doctors. Honestly, it's a whole ordeal. Just… get the tests done, quickly. And tell me where to go, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the requisition form. You'll need to take this to the lab down the hall. They'll give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. It's a fairly simple process. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to document our conversation and these findings. If you experience any significant abdominal pain, dizziness, or feel weak, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get this over with. Honestly, it's been a waste of my time. Where is this lab, exactly? And can I just get a little piece of paper with the address, please? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It's just down the hall to your left. And don't worry, the staff there are very helpful. Just to be clear, we’re investigating the cause of the black stools. It can be caused by a variety of things, including certain medications, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. We’ll discuss the results when they come back. If you don’t mind, I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today, just to check on your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week? Honestly. Fine, whatever. Just get me out of here. I have things to do. And don’t expect me to remember all of this. My husband will have to handle the appointment. Yes, just schedule it. I’m going now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day. .
