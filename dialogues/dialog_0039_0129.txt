DOCTOR: Hello Dawnetta, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. It's my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years, I suppose. Is that what you want to know? It's probably just that, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, black stool…and you’re taking red pain pills for arthritis. Yes, that’s a good place to start. It could be related to the medication, you’re right. But we need to rule out other things, just to be safe. Could you tell me a little more about the stool?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. More details? It looks black, alright? Like I said, tar. Not… not runny, thankfully. More… solid. But dark. And it smells…well, it smells like stool, what do you expect? It’s not pleasant, I assure you. I haven’t noticed any blood, if that’s what you’re getting at. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to stop taking the pills, or if I'm going to… well, you know. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, solid, dark stool, no blood…that’s helpful. And you’re understandably worried about whether it’s serious. It's good you’re bringing this up. To be thorough, and because black stool can indicate a few different things, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Oh, goodness. Well, I eat. I eat what my husband makes. He's a good cook, thankfully. I haven't been less hungry, if that's what you mean. Maybe a little tired, but who isn't at my age? I wouldn’t say my appetite has changed. It’s just… normal. I don't eat a lot of fancy things, mind you. Mostly meat and potatoes. Is that relevant? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm back in school taking a quiz.
DOCTOR: No quiz, I promise! Just trying to get a good picture of what’s going on. Meat and potatoes is perfectly fine – that's good information. Now, have you had any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No! Heavens, no. I haven't been sick to my stomach. Not a bit. I haven't thrown up in… oh, I don't even remember when. Probably years. I get a little heartburn sometimes, if I eat too much spicy food, but that’s it. Are we getting anywhere with this? I just want to know if I can keep taking my pills. My arthritis is awful when I don’t.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod slowly, reviewing my notes. I seem to be missing a key piece of information, but what?
PATIENT: Okay, no vomiting, occasional heartburn. Right. Now, I'm going to ask about your… well, your bowel movements. Besides the color, have you noticed any changes in how often you’re going, or the consistency?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Have you noticed any changes in how often you’re going, or if they feel different—harder, softer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's all pretty regular. I go… well, I go when I need to. Not more, not less. And it’s… solid. Like I said before. Nothing loose or runny, thankfully. It’s just… dark. Is this going somewhere? I'm a very practical woman, Doctor. I don't have time for endless questions. I have a garden to tend to, you know. And my husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: You’re right, we should probably get a better look. Would you mind if I listened to your abdomen and do a quick exam?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you want to poke around? Honestly, I don't see how that's going to help. But fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it, alright? I have things to do. And please, don’t find anything dreadful. I'm not a young woman anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to gently feel your abdomen here… and listen. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay. Your abdomen feels…soft. Not particularly tender. I don’t hear anything unusual. I'm going to check your vital signs, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse… everything looks stable so far.
PATIENT: Stable, you say? That’s good, isn’t it? Look, are we getting closer to figuring out if I can keep taking my pills? My arthritis is flaring up just thinking about not taking them. I'm starting to ache all over. Honestly, this is all a bit much. Do you think it could just be the pills? It feels like it's the pills.
DOCTOR: It could be the pills, yes. But black stool warrants investigation. I want to be thorough. Now, just to confirm, what’s the name of the pain medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. I told you, the red ones! The little red pills… my husband gets them for me. I think… I think it's Naproxen? Is that it? Naproxen. He gets them from the pharmacy, the big one downtown. He’s very good about remembering things, I'm terrible with names. But yes, I'm fairly certain it's Naproxen. And I take two of them, twice a day. Every day. For years. Is that enough information for you this time?
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen… and it looks like you’re also taking Omeprazole. Is that right?
PATIENT: Omeprazole? What's that? I don't remember… my husband must have added that. He’s always trying to get me to take more pills. Is that something for my stomach? He says the Naproxen is hard on it. I honestly don’t pay attention to all of them. He manages everything. Yes, I think that’s what it is…something for my stomach. He's a very good husband, you know. Just…very particular about my health. But why are you asking about all this now? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay. The Omeprazole is a medication to protect your stomach lining, often prescribed with Naproxen to prevent ulcers. Here's what I’m thinking… Sometimes, changes in bowel movements can happen when medications interact. And sometimes, even with Omeprazole, you can still experience stomach irritation. It's possible the black stool is related to a small amount of bleeding in your stomach, even if you aren't feeling any symptoms. However, we need to confirm this. I'm going to order a stool test to check for blood. We'll also do a blood test to check your iron levels and make sure everything else looks okay. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and stool tests? Honestly, this is becoming quite the ordeal. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just the pills. I can feel my arthritis acting up already. Just get it over with, please. And can we please hurry? I have a garden to tend to, you know. And my husband will be wondering where I am. And honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We'll get these tests ordered right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. And we’ll get the stool sample kit to you as well. It's just a routine precaution, I promise. While we wait for the results, I’m going to suggest temporarily stopping the Naproxen. We can discuss alternative pain management options in the meantime. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Stopping the Naproxen? Oh, heavens no. Absolutely not. I can’t possibly stop taking the Naproxen. My arthritis will be unbearable. I can barely get out of bed as it is. No, I won’t stop taking the Naproxen. Not even for a day. Is there anything else you need from me? I really need to get going. This has taken long enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your concern. Stopping the Naproxen abruptly isn’t ideal, especially with your arthritis. Okay, how about this?
PATIENT: Yes? Go on. I’m listening. But please be quick about it. I can feel my arthritis flaring up just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll continue the Naproxen, but I want you to take a medication called a proton pump inhibitor, a stronger version of the Omeprazole you’re already on, to better protect your stomach lining. And we'll monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any black, tarry stools, or any stomach pain, or feel weak or dizzy, please call us immediately, or go to the emergency room. Does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
PATIENT: A stronger pill? More pills… Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. But… alright. Fine. A stronger pill. As long as I can keep taking the Naproxen. And if I start to feel unwell, I’ll call. But I doubt it will come to that. It's probably just… my stomach. It's always my stomach. Now, can I please go? I really need to get back to my garden. And my husband will be wondering where I am. This has taken up my entire afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, you can go. The nurse will bring the prescription for the stronger medication to you. And remember, if you experience any changes in your symptoms, please don't hesitate to call. Here’s a summary of our plan: continue Naproxen, start a stronger proton pump inhibitor, and monitor for any worsening symptoms. We’ll follow up in a week to see how you’re doing. Thank you for your patience, Dawnetta. And please, enjoy your garden. It sounds lovely.
PATIENT: Enjoy my garden… Well, alright then. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I hope this stronger pill doesn’t give me any side effects. Honestly, I just want to get back to my normal routine. And tell your nurse to hurry with that prescription! My husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: I will, Dawnetta. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good afternoon. .
