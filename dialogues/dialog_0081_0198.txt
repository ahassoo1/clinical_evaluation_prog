DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking lately… I’d like to learn more about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I’ve heard it can be helpful for… well, just feeling more centered, I suppose. I don’t really have a problem, exactly, just… wanting to feel a bit calmer, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I read an article – it was in a magazine, I believe, Real Simple, on July 12th, 2025 – about how it helps with stress. And honestly, work can be a bit… intense sometimes. Though I enjoy it, fixing the signals and switches, it’s just… a lot of responsibility, you know? Ensuring everything runs smoothly. It gets my mind going.
DOCTOR: So, you're seeking… lifestyle advice, essentially?
PATIENT: I suppose that’s a good way to put it, yes. Lifestyle advice. I hadn’t really thought of it that way. I just… I feel like I’m always thinking, always planning the next step, even when I’m off work. And I’d like to… I don’t know… quiet that a bit. Is that something you can help with? I mean, do you recommend classes, or… books? Or is this something you do here? I’m a little unsure where to start.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, I am an Internal Medicine physician. I address physiological ailments, not… psychological states. While I acknowledge stress can contribute to various medical conditions, I am not qualified to provide guidance on mindfulness techniques or meditation. Perhaps a qualified therapist or counselor would be a more suitable resource. I can certainly provide you with a referral, if you'd like. Though, I must say, dedicating medical resources to something that isn't an illness seems… inefficient.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I hadn’t realized… I thought it was something doctors were starting to offer more often, especially with how much stress impacts… everything. You’re right, of course. A referral would be wonderful, if you don’t mind. Someone who actually specializes in it. And I apologize for taking up your time with something… inefficient, as you said. I just… thought I’d ask. Is there anything else I should be focusing on, health-wise, given my line of work? Any particular screenings or… things to watch out for?
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your profession – a signals and switches technician, you mentioned – and your age, we should certainly discuss preventative care. You're at an age where regular screenings become increasingly important. Have you had a recent physical exam and blood work?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one with Dr. Petrov – he’s retired now, unfortunately – on March 15th, 2025. Everything was… normal, I think. Cholesterol was a little high, he said, but nothing that needed immediate medication, just watching my diet. And my blood pressure was good, 128 over 82, if I remember correctly. He also checked my thyroid, because my mother had some issues with that, and that was fine too. He mentioned a colonoscopy was coming up, but he said I wasn’t quite at the age yet. Does that help? I have the records somewhere, if you’d like me to get them?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… helpful. A recent physical is good. However, I prefer to have my own baseline data. We will repeat the blood work, just to be certain. And while Dr. Petrov's assessment is valuable, I have my own standards. Specifically, I'd like to check your lipid panel – a more detailed cholesterol breakdown – and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Also, given your mother's thyroid issues, a repeat TSH level would be prudent. We’ll also perform a basic EKG, just as a precaution. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. A detailed lipid panel, TSH, and an EKG. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Is there anything else? Because I do have to get back to work this afternoon – the 3:15 express train has been flagged for a possible signal malfunction. It's probably nothing, but… it needs checking. I just want to be sure I understand what we’re doing and why, so I can… manage my expectations, I suppose. And schedule accordingly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, I assure you, these are standard preventative measures. We are not diagnosing anything. We are establishing a baseline to monitor your health proactively. As for your train signal, that is… frankly, outside the scope of my medical expertise. I recommend you focus on your own well-being, and leave the railway maintenance to the appropriate personnel. The lab requisition is printing now. You'll need a fasting blood draw, so no breakfast this morning. And please, schedule the EKG as soon as possible. Time is of the essence when it comes to preventative care. Here you are.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Preventative care. I understand. No breakfast. And schedule the EKG. I think I'm starting to get the message. Well, thank you, Doctor. For your… thoroughness. And the referral, if you still think it's a good idea. I’ll go take care of the blood work and the EKG. And… I really should get going. That 3:15 express… Have a good day, Doctor Paulino.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sugino. I will have my nurse provide you with the referral information. And do prioritize your health. It is… paramount. Have a productive day. .
