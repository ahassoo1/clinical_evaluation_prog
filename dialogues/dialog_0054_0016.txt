DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Farson. Nicky Farson. Yes, well, it’s this bruising. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m on a blood thinner, of course – been on it for years since…well, never you mind. But lately, any little bump, any little thing, and I look like I've been in a fight. It’s embarrassing, frankly. And concerning. I don’t want to end up in the hospital because of a scratch.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. I understand. Bruising easily when you’re on a blood thinner is definitely something we need to look into. It is concerning, and you're right to bring it up. Just to clarify, when you say "lately," about how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it’s…hard to say exactly. A few months, maybe? It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It just…gradually got worse. At first it was just a little more than usual, and I thought, “Oh, I probably just walked into something.” But now…now it’s…significant. I don't even remember bumping into things half the time. It's quite frustrating, actually. I used to be so careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual increase over a few months. That's helpful to know. And you said it’s happening with even minor bumps?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Minor bumps! I was helping my neighbor with his garden last week – just moving a few potted plants – and I got a bruise on my forearm. A potted plant, Doctor! Honestly. It's not like I was wrestling a bear. And another one… just reaching for a book on the shelf. It's… ridiculous. Are you even listening? This isn’t normal, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, I am listening. And no, that doesn’t sound normal, even with being on a blood thinner. It’s good you’re paying attention to this, and even better that you came in to get it checked out. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Ugh. Where do I even begin? Well, as I mentioned, I’ve been on a blood thinner for years. It was after… my wife passed. Blood clot. Nasty business. Other than that… high blood pressure, controlled with medication. And my knees ache, but who doesn't have aching knees at my age? I had my gallbladder out… a long time ago. Is this really necessary? I feel like I’m giving you my life story. I just want to know why I’m bruising like a peach.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, but it helps me to understand the whole picture, Mr. Farson. Knowing about the blood clot and the high blood pressure is particularly important. And the aching knees…well, that gives me a sense of your overall health. You mentioned being on a blood thinner for years after a blood clot. Do you know what kind of blood thinner you're taking?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, I don’t. I just…take the pills the pharmacy sends me. My wife always handled all that. She kept track of everything. After she… well, I just continued going to the same pharmacy, and they send me refills. I’m sure it’s the same one. Small white pill, I think. Is it really that important what kind it is? I’ve been taking something for years, and it’s always been fine until recently. This is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It’s not uncommon to not remember specific details, especially after a loss. We can definitely figure this out. It is important to know exactly which blood thinner you're taking, as different ones have different effects and require different monitoring. Let me check your records here at the pharmacy to see what’s been prescribed. It might take a moment to pull up. While I’m doing that, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. No… I haven’t noticed anything major. I’ve been a little more tired lately, perhaps. But I’m 58 years old, Doctor. I expect to be tired! And… sometimes my gums bleed a little when I brush my teeth. Just a tiny bit. It’s nothing… significant. I really don’t think so. Are you looking for something specific? This is all rather unsettling, you know. I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and slight gum bleeding. Those can be related to blood thinners, so it's good you mentioned them. We'll keep those in mind. Alright, it looks like you've been consistently prescribed warfarin for the past seven years. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Warfarin… War-far-in… No. That doesn’t ring a bell at all. Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea what that is. My wife… she always dealt with the doctors. She'd explain everything, make sure I understood. I just… took the pills. I’m starting to get a headache, frankly. This is a waste of my time. Is warfarin… strong? Is that why I’m bruising?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson, that's alright. It’s not uncommon to not remember medication names. Warfarin is a blood thinner, and it requires regular monitoring with blood tests to make sure the dosage is correct. Since you're bruising more easily and have noticed some gum bleeding, it’s possible your warfarin level is too high. That’s why we need to do a blood test to check it. Before we do that, though, let’s quickly go over a few other things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’m not a fussy eater. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. But no, no allergies. I’m quite robust, actually. Honestly, I think this whole thing is being blown out of proportion. A little bruising… People get bruises. Are you going to poke me with a needle now? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Yes, we’ll need to draw some blood to check your warfarin level, and a complete blood count as well. It will just be a quick prick, and it will help us figure out what's going on. It's important to understand the level so we can adjust your medication if needed. Before we do that, just a few more quick questions. Are you taking any other medications besides the warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me think... Yes, I take a pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small pink one. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take ibuprofen. But that's only when I need to. And… oh, sometimes a little something for my heartburn. Something over-the-counter. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case. This is all rather tedious, isn’t it? Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen occasionally for your knees, and something over-the-counter for heartburn. That's helpful to know, thank you. It’s important to know about all the medications you’re taking, even the over-the-counter ones, as they can interact with each other. Alright, Mr. Farson, I think we have enough information for now. Let's go ahead and do that blood draw. It will just take a few minutes. After we get the results, we'll discuss them and make a plan. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. I’ll meet you back here once you’re finished, and we can go over everything. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please be quick. And don’t poke me too hard. Honestly, I’m not looking forward to this at all. I’m starting to feel quite faint, actually. This is ridiculous. I just wanted to know why I’m bruising like a peach. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. The phlebotomist is very good – it should be quick and as painless as possible. And we will figure out why you’re bruising. Just take a deep breath, and we'll get through this.
