DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is giving me trouble. A sore, it is. Been there a little while now, and it’s not getting better. It hurts to walk, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a while and is making it difficult to walk. I understand. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, like a little cut, but it hasn't healed. Now it’s… well, it’s red and kinda deep. And it sometimes feels warm. I try to keep it clean, but it still bothers me. I have… the sugar sickness, you know? The doctor told me about it years ago. Does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for telling me that. The “sugar sickness,” as you call it – diabetes – can definitely affect healing, so that’s important information. It sounds like this sore has been present for some time and isn’t improving with basic care. Just to clarify, when you say “years ago” with the diabetes diagnosis, do you recall approximately how many years ago, and are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years… maybe twenty years now? Something like that. A long time. And yes, I take a pill every morning. A little white one. I think it helps, but sometimes I forget to take it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. They know me well there. Do they tell you when I pick it up? They might have a record.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Twenty years is a significant time, and it’s good you’re taking medication for your diabetes, even if it’s not always consistent. We can certainly check with the pharmacy for a record of your medication. Now, back to the foot sore for a moment. Has the sore changed in size or appearance recently?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I think it might be a little bigger now. Not much, but… maybe a little. And it sometimes… smells a little bit. I try to wash it good, but it’s hard to get rid of the smell. Also, sometimes my leg feels… achy. Not always, but when I walk a lot. It’s mostly in the calf, I think. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the sore is possibly growing, has an odor, and you’re experiencing some aching in your calf. The odor and the ache in your calf are concerning, and combined with your history of diabetes, we need to take a closer look. I'd like to do a quick physical examination of your foot and leg. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want this sore to get better. It's making it hard to do things. I like to garden, you see, but I can't do much walking on the dirt now.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on and get you back to gardening as soon as possible. First, I’m going to take a look at the sore itself. Could you please remove your sock and shoe on your affected foot?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, it might be a little tender. I apologize if it’s not pretty to look at. It’s been bothering me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I see the sore. It is located on the plantar aspect of your foot, near the base of your fifth toe. There’s some surrounding redness and inflammation, and it does appear to be deep. The area is warm to the touch, and I’m detecting a diminished pulse in your foot compared to the other side. Your calf feels slightly tender as well. Based on this initial examination, it appears you may have a developing foot ulcer, potentially complicated by a possible infection. Given your history of diabetes and the diminished pulse, this needs to be addressed promptly.
PATIENT: Oh dear. An ulcer? And an infection? That doesn’t sound good. What does that mean? Will I have to go to the hospital? I'm not a fan of hospitals, you see. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe some cream? I've tried some things from the store before, but they didn't help much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. An ulcer means there’s a break in the skin, and the redness, warmth, and diminished pulse suggest a possible infection. It’s important to take this seriously, especially with diabetes, as infections can sometimes become quite serious. We aren’t necessarily looking at a hospital stay right now, but we do need to take action. Simply using over-the-counter creams likely won’t be enough. I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Specifically, I recommend a wound culture to identify any bacteria present, and a vascular study to assess the blood flow to your foot. These tests will help us determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, it’s very important that you avoid putting any weight on the foot as much as possible. I’m going to have the nurse bring you a pair of special shoes to help relieve pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Tests and special shoes… I can do that. I don’t want it to get worse. No weight on the foot… that will be hard, but I’ll try my best. I appreciate you taking care of this. What about the pain? It’s been getting worse, especially at night. Is there something I can take for the pain?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. We’ll work through this together. Yes, let’s address the pain. Given your history, we need to be careful with pain medication. I’m going to start you on a low dose of acetaminophen – that’s Tylenol – which is generally safe for people with diabetes. We can adjust the dosage if needed. I will also write you a prescription for a topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the wound twice daily after washing it with mild soap and water. The nurse will go over detailed instructions for wound care and medication usage before you leave. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in three days to review the test results and assess your progress. If you experience any fever, increased pain, redness, or swelling, please contact the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Acetaminophen and ointment… and I’ll be careful about keeping it clean. Three days for a follow-up... I can do that. And I’ll watch for fever and redness. Thank you so much for everything. I feel a little better just knowing we have a plan. Do you think I’ll be able to garden again? Eventually? That’s what I really want.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm glad to hear you feel a bit more reassured. And yes, I absolutely think you'll be able to garden again eventually. It may take some time and effort, and we need to get this wound healed properly first, but that is certainly a realistic goal. We’ll work towards that together. The key is to follow the treatment plan, manage your diabetes carefully, and protect your foot. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions and medication orders. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and explain everything. I really appreciate it. I’ll see you in three days. Stop.
