DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. VODZAK. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. VODZAK, nice to meet you too. It's… well, it's my stomach. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with… going to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. Diarrhea, basically. It’s been going on for a while, and it’s… annoying. I think someone mentioned something about it being connected to something I have… like a food thing? I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: I see. Annoying is a good way to put it – dealing with ongoing diarrhea can certainly disrupt your life. And you mentioned someone alluded to a possible food-related cause?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. My… husband, I think it was, said something about… IBD or celiac? Or something like that. He does a lot of the… doctor stuff, usually. I just feel unwell, and he gets all the details. Honestly, I don't remember being told much when I was first diagnosed, if I was diagnosed. Does that make sense? It feels like a blur.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It’s very common for one partner to take the lead with medical information, and it can be overwhelming to remember everything, especially if it was some time ago. So, let’s try to piece things together. You mentioned IBD or celiac disease. Do you know when you were told about this possibility, or roughly when these symptoms first started?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's a good question… I really don’t know. It was… a few years ago, I think? Maybe five? Or more? It feels like a long time, and everything kinda blends together. The symptoms… they come and go, you know? Sometimes I’m okay for a bit, and then it starts again. Lately, it's been… more often. It's just been… persistent. I don't really keep track of when things start, to be honest. Sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly helpful, Jase. It's completely understandable that it's hard to remember details from several years ago, especially with intermittent symptoms. Let’s focus on now. You said lately the diarrhea has been more persistent. Can you describe what it's like?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Now is easier. Um… it’s just… a lot. Like, several times a day. It's watery, and… sometimes there's cramping. Not awful cramping, but enough to make me not want to go far from a bathroom, if you know what I mean. And it wakes me up at night sometimes. That's the worst part, really. It's just… exhausting. I haven’t been eating much because I’m worried about it, which I guess makes it worse? I don't know. Everything feels a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly disruptive to your sleep and daily life, and understandably frustrating. It's good you've noticed the connection between eating and the symptoms – that's helpful information. To get a clearer picture, let me ask about other things you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I… think so? Maybe? It’s hard to say. Sometimes there’s… a little bit of red. It's not a lot, and it's not always there, but I have noticed it a couple of times. I just sort of… ignored it? I didn’t want to think about it. Is that bad? I don't really like thinking about… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay that you've ignored it – it's common to avoid thinking about things that are uncomfortable. However, noticing blood in your stool is something we definitely need to investigate further. It doesn’t automatically mean something serious, but it’s important to rule out potential causes. To get a more comprehensive understanding, let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so? Maybe a little? My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really been weighing myself. My husband does the weighing, usually. He’s been… busy lately, though. So, it’s hard to say for sure. I haven’t been feeling particularly hungry, so maybe I just haven't been eating as much. It’s all a bit… blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that. "Blurry" is a good way to put it, and it’s helpful for me to understand the situation. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Um… I have… high blood pressure, I think? My husband gives me pills for it. And… I had my gallbladder out a few years ago. That's all I can really remember, to be honest. Everything else… is a bit of a blank. I think that’s everything. I really rely on my husband to remember things, and he's not here right now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jase. It’s perfectly alright. High blood pressure and a history of gallbladder removal are important to know. And it’s good you’re taking medication for your blood pressure. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the medication for your blood pressure, are you currently taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… I take… something for heartburn sometimes. Just when it's really bad. It's an over-the-counter thing, I think? Like… Tums or something. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I think we ran out a while ago. I haven't replaced it. That's it, I think. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! I don't think so… I mean, I haven't had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. My husband always checks when he gets me new medication, so if there was anything he would have said something. No… I think I’m okay. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Okay, Jase, this is helpful. Now, let's briefly touch on family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, colon cancer, or other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… That’s a hard one. My… my dad had some stomach problems, I think. He wasn’t very good at talking about it. Something about… ulcers, maybe? And my mom had… high blood pressure, like me. She was on medication for it too. That’s all I can really remember, honestly. We don't really talk about medical stuff much in my family.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Knowing about the high blood pressure is helpful. Now, finally, let's briefly touch on social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. My husband and I are both pretty healthy, we try to be, anyway. We just eat reasonably well and try to stay active when we can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for sharing all of this with me, Jase. That gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Dr. VODZAK. I just want to figure out what’s going on, so I can feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Okay, I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they're a bit hyperactive, which isn’t entirely surprising with the diarrhea. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen now to check for any tenderness. Tell me if anything feels painful. Okay… there's some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant, but nothing too concerning. No rebound tenderness, which is good. Your abdomen isn’t distended. Based on your history and the physical exam, the persistent diarrhea, cramping, and occasional blood in your stool are concerning. Given your husband’s mention of IBD or celiac disease, and the tenderness in your lower left quadrant, I want to order some tests to investigate further. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I just want to know what’s wrong. Tests are good. What kind of tests? Will they be… unpleasant? I'm a little nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable to be nervous. I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation or anemia. I’m also going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolytes. The most important test, given your symptoms and husband’s recollection, is a stool sample analysis. This will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, and blood. We'll also test for C. difficile, a common cause of diarrhea. To further investigate the possibility of celiac disease, I’d like to order a blood test for specific antibodies. Finally, I'd like to order a colonoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your colon to visualize the lining and take a small tissue sample if needed. It’s the most definitive way to diagnose IBD or celiac disease, but it does require bowel preparation, which can be a bit unpleasant, I won’t lie. We can discuss the bowel prep in detail if the other tests indicate it’s necessary. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Ugh. That’s… a lot. A colonoscopy… that sounds… scary. And unpleasant bowel prep? I really don’t like the sound of that. What if the blood tests show something… bad? Is it definitely something serious?
DOCTOR: It is a lot, and your reaction is completely valid. A colonoscopy can sound daunting, but it’s a very safe procedure, and we take every precaution to ensure your comfort. We’ll give you medication to help you relax and manage any discomfort. And yes, the bowel preparation isn’t pleasant, but it’s a necessary step to get a clear view of your colon. Now, regarding the blood tests, it’s too early to say definitively if something is serious. The tests are simply to gather information. They can help us rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as infection or inflammation, and determine if further investigation, like the colonoscopy, is necessary. If the blood tests show something concerning, it doesn’t automatically mean you have IBD or celiac disease, or anything serious. It simply means we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a plan of action together. I understand you're anxious, and I want to reassure you that we'll take things one step at a time. Let’s start with the blood tests and stool sample. We’ll get those results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That… that does sound better. Blood tests and a stool sample… I can manage that. Where do I go to get those done? And… how long will it take? I need to get this sorted out, so I can get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very good approach. I’ll write you a lab requisition for both the blood tests and the stool sample. You can go to any lab that accepts our insurance – I’ll provide a list of convenient locations nearby. The blood tests should take about 15-20 minutes. For the stool sample, you’ll receive a collection kit at the lab. There are specific instructions for collecting the sample – it’s important to follow them carefully. You’ll need to bring the sample back to the lab within 24-48 hours of collection. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Avoid foods that trigger your diarrhea, such as dairy, caffeine, and sugary drinks. You can also try over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide, but use them cautiously and follow the package instructions. Do you have any questions about the tests or symptom management?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything for now. So, blood tests and a stool sample… and then we wait. Okay. Thank you, Dr. VODZAK. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve made me feel… a little bit better. I’ll go and get those tests done as soon as possible. And I'll try to stay hydrated and avoid triggering foods. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then.
