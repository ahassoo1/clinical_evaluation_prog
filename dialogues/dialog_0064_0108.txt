DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, I ain't one for small talk. It’s my stomach. Been bleedin’. Not a little, either. It’s… unpleasant. And frankly, I’m tired of dealin’ with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bleeding is definitely not something to ignore. Can you tell me a bit more about this bleeding?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? It's blood, coming outta me, from down there. Dark, kinda chunky sometimes. Happens mostly after I… well, after I use the bathroom. Though it’s been happenin’ more randomly lately. Not a pleasant topic, I assure you. And I don’t need a lecture about details, doc. I'm a grown man.
DOCTOR: No lecture, Mr. Gentz, I assure you. Just trying to get a clear picture. When you say "dark, chunky sometimes," how often would you say that happens?
PATIENT: Ugh, look. It's not every time. Maybe… two, three times a week now? It used to be just a little bit, you know, a few drops. Now… it’s enough to worry me. And it’s not like I got money to just be runnin’ to the hospital every other day. My wife… well, she handled all that. Now it’s just me. And I’m tellin’ ya, this ain’t right. It’s different.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it’s good you came in. A change in bowel habits, especially with bleeding, is something we need to investigate. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s been going on. Now, besides the bleeding, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes? Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I just know somethin’s wrong. I feel… tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And… look, this is embarrassing, but I haven’t been eatin’ much. Don’t have much of an appetite. Everything just… sits in my stomach. And, yeah, I’ve been a little weaker, too. Can barely get through a shift at work these days. It's a good thing I don't need to lift much, being where I work. But still. Not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, loss of appetite, feeling weak… those are all important things to know. And it’s good you’re telling me all this, even if it’s embarrassing. You work, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, I work at the… well, it's a crematory. Burns the dead. Not glamorous work, I assure you. Been doin’ it for… fifteen years now. It's quiet, mostly. Which is good, considering. Not many folks wanna talk to a guy who burns bodies all day. But it pays the bills. Or, used to. Now, with me feelin' like this, I'm worried about keepin' my job, honestly. And I definitely can't afford to lose it. It's not like there's a lot of options for a guy my age.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fifteen years is a long time. And I appreciate you being upfront about everything. Now, have you had any pain with this bleeding, or at all?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… sharp pain. More like a dull ache, kinda low down in my belly. Comes and goes. It's been worse lately, though. Especially after… well, you know. It's not somethin' I usually bother with, frankly. I can handle a little discomfort. But this… this is different. It keeps me up at night sometimes. And the tiredness… it’s just makin’ everything worse. It's like I'm runnin' on empty.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I ain’t been to a doctor in… well, probably ten years. My wife took care of all that. I remember she said somethin' about my blood pressure bein' a little high once, but she handled it. Gave me some pills, I think. I don’t really remember. Other than that… nothin’. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Tough as nails, she used to say. Now… well, clearly somethin's changed. I ain't as tough as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. And it's alright if you don't remember specifics. We can work with what you do recall. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never needed 'em. Broken a few bones workin’ over the years, but never anything that needed cuttin'. Just a few casts, that’s it. I pride myself on bein’ a sturdy fella. Though, like I said, that’s changin’. It’s just… I don’t understand what’s happenin’ to me. I’m gettin’ too old for this. And frankly, I’m worried about what this is gonna cost. I got nothin' saved up, you know? My wife… she handled all that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. We'll take it one step at a time, Mr. Gentz, and figure out what's going on. And we can discuss options for care and potential costs. I want to get a better understanding of your family history now, if you can recall. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had… stomach problems, I think. Lots of pain, she used to complain about. They never really figured out what it was. Just gave her some pills to manage the pain. She died young, though. Heart attack, I think. My father… he was healthy as an ox. Lived 'til he was eighty. Other than that… nothin' I can think of. My wife's family… I didn't really know 'em that well. She didn’t talk about 'em much. Honestly, doc, I’m not a family history kinda guy. I just know somethin’s wrong with me right now. And I need it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. We don't need a perfect family history. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. My wife gave me pills for headaches sometimes, and I never had any trouble. Never reacted to anything. I can usually handle anything. Though, like I said, I ain't been feelin' like myself lately. Maybe I'm startin' to develop allergies now. Everything’s different, doc. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. And how much this is gonna cost. I'm really startin' to worry about that, honestly. I don't have anyone to help me with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Gentz, and we will definitely discuss that. We have resources available to help. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Not since… well, not since my wife passed. She had a whole cabinet full of pills, for everything. But I don’t take nothin’ anymore. I figured I could handle it on my own. Clearly, I was wrong. And, frankly, I’m tired of dealin’ with this. I just want it fixed, doc. And I need to know how much it’s gonna cost me. I can’t afford to be runnin’ back and forth to the hospital every other day. I got nothin’ saved up.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible next steps, including potential costs and resources. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I got a shift to get back to later, if I even can make it through it. Just… be quick, alright? And tell me what you find. I don't want any surprises. And I want to know how much this is gonna cost. Every step of the way. I need to know what I'm gettin' into.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as we go. And I'll keep you informed of any potential costs. If you could lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let’s get this over with. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? And tell me what you’re doin’ before you do it. I don't like surprises. And again… how much is this gonna cost? Just lay it on me straight. I can’t afford any hidden fees.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope first, just to get a general sense of things. Then I'll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. As for the costs, we'll have a better idea after the exam and any potential tests. But our billing department is very transparent, and we can discuss options if needed. Now, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing some normal bowel sounds… a little diminished, but not alarming at this point. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that’s… tender right there. Lower left side. It’s not sharp pain, like I said, just… uncomfortable. Feels kinda… bloated. And yeah, it hurts a little when you press on it. Not a lot, but enough to notice. Just… be careful, alright? I don't wanna make it worse. And… how much is this gonna cost? Seriously, doc, I need to know. Every poke and prod has a price tag, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left quadrant. I'm also noting some mild guarding, which means your muscles are tensing up when I press on that area. That can indicate some inflammation. Now, I'm going to continue palpating to check for any masses or other abnormalities. I'm also checking your vital signs now. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, and your pulse is 80. Your temperature is normal at 98.6. I'm not feeling any obvious masses, but there is definite tenderness and some resistance in the lower left quadrant. Okay. Based on this exam, I'm concerned about possible inflammation or irritation in the lower left quadrant of your abdomen. Given your symptoms of bleeding, fatigue, and loss of appetite, I think we need to do some further testing.
PATIENT: Testing? What kinda testing? More poking and prodding? What's it gonna cost? And what does "inflammation" even mean? Is it serious? Look, doc, I ain’t a doctor, alright? Just tell me straight. Is this somethin’ I need to worry about? And how much is this gonna cost? I’m startin’ to get really worried here. I can barely afford to be here, let alone pay for a bunch of tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz. It's perfectly normal to be worried. "Inflammation" simply means your tissues are irritated and swollen. It can be caused by a number of things, and it's not always serious, but it's important to figure out the cause. Given your symptoms, I recommend a complete blood count to check for anemia and infection, and a stool test to look for blood and possible infection. We may also need to consider a colonoscopy to get a better look at your colon, but we can discuss that after we get the results of the initial tests. The CBC and stool test will cost around $200 to $300. A colonoscopy, if needed, would be significantly more, around $1500 to $2000. I know that’s a lot of money, and I want to assure you that we have resources available to help. We can discuss payment plans or financial assistance programs. Our billing department can provide you with more information. Right now, my priority is to figure out what’s going on and get you the treatment you need. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: $200 to $300... alright. I can maybe swing that. But $1500 to $2000? Doc, that’s… that’s impossible. I don’t have that kinda money. I’m a widower, workin’ a dead-end job, and barely makin’ ends meet. I ain’t got insurance, and my wife… well, she handled all that. So, what if I just… skip the colonoscopy? Is that even an option? Can you figure out what’s wrong with just the blood tests? I don’t want to get myself into debt over this. I’m really startin’ to regret comin’ here. I shoulda just suffered through it. Look, doc, I need you to be straight with me. Is this serious enough to warrant that kinda cost? Or can we just… try somethin’ else? Maybe some pills or somethin’? I just want it to stop, and I can’t afford to go broke over it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your financial concerns completely, and I wouldn't recommend any tests or procedures without thoroughly discussing the risks and benefits. Given your symptoms of bleeding, fatigue, and the tenderness in your abdomen, we need to rule out any serious causes. A colonoscopy is the most accurate way to visualize your colon and identify any abnormalities, such as polyps or tumors. While it's the most thorough approach, it’s not the only option. We can start with the blood tests and a stool test. If those tests are inconclusive, we can discuss other options, such as a CT scan of your abdomen, which is less expensive than a colonoscopy but may not provide as much detail. However, I want to be clear: skipping a thorough investigation could delay a diagnosis and potentially worsen your condition. If there is something serious going on, early detection is key. I want to work with you to find a solution that’s both affordable and effective. Let’s start with the blood tests and stool test. If those results are concerning, we can discuss financial assistance programs or other options for the colonoscopy. In the meantime, I can prescribe you some medication to help manage the bleeding and discomfort, but that’s just a temporary solution. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Blood tests and stool tests. That’s all I can afford right now. And yeah, some pills to stop the bleedin’ would be good. Just… don’t give me nothin’ too strong, alright? I don’t want to be knocked out cold. And you promise you’ll work with me on the costs? I need to know I’m not gonna end up in debt over this. My wife… she always took care of this stuff. I feel lost without her. So, what do I need to do? Where do I go? And how long is this gonna take? I got a shift to get back to, you know? I can't be missin' work. Just… make it quick, alright? And keep the costs down. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I'll write you a prescription for iron supplements to help with the anemia and a medication called mesalamine to help reduce the inflammation and bleeding. It's a mild medication, and shouldn't knock you out cold. I'm going to give you a lab requisition for the blood tests and stool test. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. It should take about 30-45 minutes. The results usually come back within 2-3 business days. Once I have the results, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. As for the costs, I’ll have our billing department contact you to discuss payment options and financial assistance programs. They can also provide you with a detailed breakdown of the costs. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And call me when the results are in. Don't keep me waitin'. I need to get back to work. And… thanks, doc. I guess. It's just… a lot to take in. Alright. Let's go. Show me where to get these tests done. I got a shift to make. And I'm really startin’ to feel weak.
DOCTOR: Of course. Right this way. The lab technician will take excellent care of you. Just let them know you’re here for the tests I ordered. And Mr. Gentz, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. .
