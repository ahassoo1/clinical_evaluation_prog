DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is fine. Look, I’m here for this… test. For the army. They want me to get checked out first, you know? Seems a bit much, but rules are rules. I need a paper saying I’m… fit. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Hartness. So, this is a pre-enlistment physical. I see. Okay. To get that paper you need, we’ll need to go through a pretty standard exam and some questions. Just to make sure everything is as it should be. First, can you tell me a bit more about why the army is requesting this check-up now?
PATIENT: Why now? Honestly, I haven't the foggiest. They just… do. Always have. It's… bureaucracy, I suppose. They sent a letter. Said I needed this done before I could even think about signing up. I'm 51, not some young pup. You'd think they'd be happy someone still wants to serve. But no. Paperwork. It’s always paperwork.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It is a lot of paperwork. Okay. Well, let’s focus on getting you what you need. To start, can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm. Let me think. Nothing major. Had a bad back a few years back, lifting some steel. The wife made me go to a physical therapist. Helped a bit, mostly just told me to lift with my legs. Other than that… I get the occasional cold. Nothing a good Swedish remedy can’t fix. And my knees creak a little in the winter. You get old, things wear out, you know? I don’t need a diagnosis for getting old.
DOCTOR: Right, you're absolutely right about things wearing out with age. We just need to document everything for the army's records. Okay, so back pain...was that a single incident, or ongoing?
PATIENT: It was… a single incident, really. I was moving a large engine block in the workshop. Bad form, probably. The wife… she always said I don't listen. It hurt like hell for a week or so, then the therapist got me doing some stretches. Haven’t had trouble like that since, thankfully. It’s just… I’m more careful now. And I make sure to listen to the wife more. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good. Listening to your wife is always a good idea. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had anything cut open. I take care of myself, you know? Good food, sensible lifting...and I avoid doctors if I can help it. Too many needles and poking around. And waiting rooms full of… sniffles. No thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little vitamin D in the winter. Sweden doesn’t get a lot of sun, you see. Helps with the bones. That’s it. Nothing else. I don’t believe in filling myself with pills unless I absolutely have to. And I certainly don't go around asking for… prescriptions. Healthy living, that's what I’m about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I can eat anything. I like everything. Though, I don’t particularly care for those… fancy French pastries. Too sweet. But that's a preference, not an allergy. I've never had a reaction to anything. Never. Though, my wife is allergic to cats. And dust. But that’s her problem, not mine.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father lived to be 88, strong as an ox. Worked in a shipyard all his life. Didn’t go to doctors either. My mother, she had… well, she had headaches. A lot of headaches. But that’s all I remember. Nothing major. My grandfather, he fell off a roof when he was young, broke his leg. But that was an accident, not something… inherited. Honestly, we're a pretty healthy bunch. Strong Swedish stock, you know. We don't get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never. Disgusting habit. My father always said it rots your lungs. And smells awful. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't like being around people who do. It’s… unhealthy. And frankly, a bit silly. I like fresh air, thank you very much. A good walk in the woods is much better.
DOCTOR: Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of snaps with the wife on a special occasion. Maybe a beer with friends during the midsummer celebrations. Nothing excessive. I don't need alcohol to have a good time. And I certainly don't drink every day. Sensible drinking, that's what I believe in. A little bit won't hurt anyone. Keeps the blood flowing, they say. But no, I’m not a drinker. Not really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? I don’t particularly enjoy having strangers listen to my insides. But if it’s what I need to get this paper, then… go ahead. But be gentle. And quick. I have things to do, you know. Engines don't assemble themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hartness. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, if you could just sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me… Heart sounds are regular rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal. Alright, that’s all. Everything appears normal so far. I'll need to get your height and weight. Could you stand on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. I knew I was in good shape. Never been sick a day in my life. Except for that one cold a few years back, but I told you about that. There. Get on with it. Don't take all day. I haven't eaten since breakfast. And I’m not getting any younger, you know. These old bones need fuel.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's 53 kilograms and 187 centimeters. Your BMI is… 15.1. Mr. Hartness, your BMI is significantly low. This is considered underweight. We need to discuss this. Are you intentionally restricting your diet?
PATIENT: Underweight? What are you talking about? I eat plenty. Good Swedish food, lots of potatoes and meat. My wife feeds me well. I may be… lean, but I'm strong as an ox! Look at these arms! Lean is healthy, isn’t it? Not some… bloated mess. I work hard, physical labor all day. It burns calories! What’s wrong with that? You're telling me I need to gain weight? That sounds ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness. And I appreciate you telling me you feel strong and healthy. However, a BMI of 15.1 is a medical concern. It can lead to weakness, fatigue, and other health problems. It’s possible there's a reason for this low BMI that we haven’t yet identified. While you say you eat well, it might be helpful to have some blood work done to check for any underlying medical conditions or nutritional deficiencies. Would you be willing to consider some basic blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Now you're just trying to find something wrong with me! I don’t need blood tests! I've never had blood tests in my life, and I don't intend to start now. It's a waste of time and money. I feel perfectly fine. Strong as an ox, I tell you! Look, I just need this paper for the army. Are you going to give it to me, or are you going to keep poking and prodding and asking for tests? I haven't got all day, you know. I have engines to assemble! And a wife who’s probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration and your desire to get this paper quickly. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Providing you with a form stating you are fit for duty without thoroughly assessing your condition would be irresponsible. Your BMI is significantly below the healthy range, and ignoring that could potentially lead to serious health consequences. I am willing to compromise. I will provide you with a limited physical exam form with a note stating my concern about your low BMI and recommending a follow-up with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. This will allow you to submit the form to the army while still addressing the potential health concern. However, I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with a doctor to discuss this further. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: … Fine. A limited form. With a note. But no poking around! And I'm not promising anything about seeing another doctor. My wife will have a fit if I start spending all my time in waiting rooms. Just get it over with. I need that paper. And I’m not wasting another minute on this nonsense. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Here you go. This form states you have undergone a physical examination and lists the findings. As you can see, I’ve included a note expressing my concern regarding your low BMI and recommending further evaluation. I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment with your doctor, even if it’s just for a quick check-up. It's important to rule out any underlying health issues. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Finally. Thank you. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have things to do. .
