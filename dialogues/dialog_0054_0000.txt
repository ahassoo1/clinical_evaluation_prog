DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. I had a nasty cold last week – just a little one, really – and now my legs feel…well, like jelly. It started a couple of days ago, just a slight wobble, but it’s gotten worse. It’s just…weak. I don’t understand why a simple cold would do this. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It is unusual for a cold to cause leg weakness, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. “Like jelly” is a helpful description. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It was maybe three days ago, like I said. I was unloading groceries from the car. Nothing heavy, just the usual. And I just…felt unsteady. I thought I was tired, to be honest. I brushed it off. But then yesterday, getting out of the shower… I nearly fell. It felt like they just wouldn't hold me up. It’s both legs, and it’s…consistent, I guess. It hasn’t gotten better at all. I don’t like this. It’s just…not normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started with a feeling of unsteadiness three days ago while unloading groceries, and has progressed to difficulty holding yourself up, particularly yesterday in the shower. And it’s been consistent since then, meaning no improvement. That’s helpful to know. Besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, my hands have been a little…tingly. Not constantly, just off and on. And I’ve felt a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who hasn't been tired lately? That’s probably not important. Oh! And my feet feel…cold. Even when the rest of me isn’t. They’re always cold, actually. I always have to wear socks, even in the summer. Is that relevant? It’s just…something I’ve always dealt with.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Ms. Firestone. The tingling in your hands and the consistently cold feet are definitely worth noting. Has the tingling been in all your fingers, or just some?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly in my fingertips, Doctor. Like when you’ve been holding something really cold for too long. That sort of feeling. And it comes and goes, it’s not constant. Honestly, I barely noticed it until you asked. I just…dismissed it as being silly. I don’t want to waste your time with unimportant details. I just want to know why my legs are failing me after a simple cold. It’s…frightening, really.
DOCTOR: It’s not wasting my time at all, Ms. Firestone. These details help me build a complete picture. Fingertip tingling that comes and goes is useful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, my doctor always tells me my cholesterol is a little high, but he never puts me on anything for it. Just tells me to watch my diet. And I was diagnosed with…osteopenia, years ago. Bone density. But that’s just…old age, I suppose. I'm not on any medication, haven’t been for years. And I don’t really have any allergies. No, I think that’s it. I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was ages ago and doesn’t bother me anymore. Really, I’m quite healthy, usually. This leg thing is just…so strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slightly elevated cholesterol, osteopenia diagnosed in the past, a hysterectomy years ago, and otherwise generally healthy. No current medications or allergies. That’s helpful. Now, has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had similar issues, like leg weakness, tingling, or any neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother…she had arthritis, badly, in her hands and knees. Very painful, towards the end. And my father…he had heart problems. He died of a stroke, actually. But I don’t think he ever had anything like this. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Runs marathons, the silly man. No, I don’t recall anyone else having…leg weakness or tingling. It's just…me. And it's all so sudden. It’s really quite unnerving, Doctor. It feels like something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It is unsettling to experience new symptoms like this. Alright, let’s move on to some basic questions. Could you describe your typical daily activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I used to be very active. I loved to garden, I walked my dog every day. But after the divorce…I haven’t been as motivated, I suppose. I do a little light housework, I go to the grocery store, I visit my daughter and grandchildren a couple of times a week. Nothing strenuous, certainly. I sit a lot more than I used to, I’ll admit that. Watching television, reading…I’m not a very…ambitious person these days. It’s rather sad, really. But I haven’t completely given up, I assure you. Just…less energetic.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and I saw what it did to her. Horrible cough, always wheezing. No, I wouldn't dream of it. As for alcohol… I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a week. But that's it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I don't engage in such…activities. Really, I lead a very…ordinary life. A rather boring life, if I’m being honest. But a respectable one.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Firestone. Now, with your permission, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Please, go ahead. I’m a bit nervous, if I’m being honest, but I’ll try to cooperate. Just…be gentle, alright? My legs feel rather fragile at the moment. I don’t want to fall or anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then we'll move on to the neurological exam. It will involve some simple tests, like checking your reflexes with a small hammer and asking you to move your legs in different directions. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s move on to the neurological exam. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. 130/80… is that good? I never really pay attention to those numbers. Alright, here I am. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. It’s a bit…cold in here, actually. But I’ll manage. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just…try not to hit me too hard with that hammer, alright? I’m a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I won’t hit you hard, Ms. Firestone. It’s a very gentle tap. I’m just checking your reflexes. Okay, let’s start with this leg. That’s a good response… Now, let’s try the other one. Hmm… That’s a little diminished on this side. Now, I’m going to ask you to move your legs against my resistance. Could you please try to push your leg down against my hand?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels…a bit weak, doesn’t it? I’m trying, Doctor, I really am. But it’s not as strong as it used to be. It feels…effortful. Like I’m wading through mud. And it's…uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but…just…not right. I don’t know how to explain it. It's just…not working properly. I feel rather silly, struggling like this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Firestone, you're not silly at all. It's good you're letting me know what you're feeling. I notice some weakness on that side, as you said. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Could you close your eyes, and tell me when I touch your foot with this?
PATIENT: Alright, closed. Yes, I can feel it. Just tell me when you touch it. It's a bit numb, actually. Not completely, but…less feeling than usual. Like wearing thick socks. It feels…distant. And cold. Always cold. Is that normal, Doctor? Is this all connected? This weakness, the tingling, the cold feet… It’s all rather unsettling, really. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. Your sensation is indeed diminished on both feet, as you noted. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes again, but this time I’m going to look at how your toes curl when I stroke the sole of your foot. Hmm… That’s a little sluggish on this side. Okay, that completes the neurological exam. Based on what I’m seeing – the weakness, diminished sensation, and sluggish reflexes – I think we need to do some further testing to get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Further testing? Oh, dear. What kind of testing? Is it going to be painful? I don’t do well with needles, Doctor. And what do you think it is? Is it something serious? My mother always said I worry too much, but…this is frightening. My legs just…stopped working properly after a simple cold. It doesn't make any sense. Please tell me you have some idea of what’s going on. I just want to get back to normal, you know? Spending time with my grandchildren…that’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Firestone, and I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time. It's good we are investigating this. Based on the exam, the possibilities include a few different things. It could be something affecting the nerves, like peripheral neuropathy, or it could be related to a problem with blood flow. It’s also possible, though less likely given your symptoms, that it’s a muscle issue. The testing I’d like to order includes a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, and inflammation. I also want to order an MRI of your lower back to rule out any nerve compression. And finally, I’d like to send you to a neurologist for a nerve conduction study, which will help us assess the function of the nerves in your legs. The blood test is just a standard draw, a little pinch, and shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. The MRI is painless, you’ll just lie in a scanner for a bit. The nerve conduction study can be a little uncomfortable, it involves some small electrical stimulation, but it’s usually well-tolerated. We will start with the blood test today. Then we can schedule the MRI and neurology appointment. It’s important to get this checked out, but I don’t want you to panic. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds…extensive. MRI, nerve conduction studies… It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Nerve conduction studies with electrical stimulation? That sounds…unpleasant. And what if it is something serious? My mother… she had arthritis, and it was so painful. I don’t want to end up like her, unable to do anything. Vitamin deficiencies? I eat reasonably well, I think. But I do have a bit of a sweet tooth… Could that be it? Too much sugar? And a neurologist? I’ve never seen a neurologist before. Are they…scary? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor, but…could we maybe start with the blood test? And just see what that shows? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, you know? I just want to know if it’s something simple. Something I can fix with a change of diet or something. I’d rather not have an MRI or a nerve conduction study if we don’t need to. I’m a bit of a worrier, as I said. This is all rather frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Firestone. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to start with the least invasive tests first, and we can absolutely do that. Let’s start with the blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, and inflammation. That will give us some valuable information. We can then review the results together, and if needed, we can discuss the MRI and neurology referral at that time. I assure you, neurologists are not scary! They are specialists in the nervous system and very good at diagnosing and treating these types of conditions. We will only refer you if it’s necessary. I will order the blood test now, and the lab is just down the hall. They will take a small sample of blood, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to avoid sugary foods and drinks, and to try to eat a balanced diet. We will take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. I want to assure you that we will find out what’s going on and develop a plan to get you back to feeling your best. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the blood test?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright. Just the blood test for now. That sounds…manageable. And then we’ll see what the results say. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I do tend to worry a lot, as I said. It’s just…my legs are so important to me. Being able to walk and spend time with my grandchildren…that’s everything. Is there anything I should do before the blood test? Should I fast? Drink anything special? I don’t want to mess up the results. I’m always so careful about these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Firestone. I understand your anxiety, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Yes, for the blood test, it’s best to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. So, if you can, try to schedule the test first thing in the morning after you’ve had a good night’s sleep. That will give us the most accurate results. The lab technician will give you specific instructions when you arrive, but it’s good to be prepared. And don’t worry, it’s a very routine procedure. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Fast for 8-12 hours, and drink only water. I can manage that. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease…a little. I still worry, of course, but…knowing what to expect helps. I suppose I should go down to the lab then? Is it…easy to find? I’m not very good with directions.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s very easy to find. Just head down the hallway to your left, and you’ll see the lab on your right. It’s well-signposted. And if you get lost, just ask one of the nurses at the reception desk, they’ll be happy to help. I’ll be here in the office if you have any questions after the blood test. And we’ll review the results as soon as they come back. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you need anything at all. I hope everything goes smoothly. Please try not to worry too much, and remember that we will take things one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will try not to worry. One step at a time… that’s what you said. I suppose I'll go then. Thank you again for everything.
