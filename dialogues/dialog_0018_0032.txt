DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Stilaire, you say? A… French name, isn’t it? Yes, well. It’s… a delicate matter, really. Something a man doesn’t usually discuss with… well, anyone, let alone a woman. It’s… a discharge. From… down there. It’s been… present for a few days now, and my wife insisted I come. She's a very… practical woman, my wife. Though frankly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to discuss personal matters, and I assure you, this is a safe space. Many men experience similar concerns, and we can certainly address this. It’s good that your wife encouraged you to seek medical attention; early evaluation is always best. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. Well… it’s… wet, naturally. And… a bit… yellowish, I suppose. Not terribly… pungent, but noticeable. It’s not… gushing, mind you. More of a… a dampness. And it seems worse after… after I relieve myself. Though I can’t say for certain. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Things just… blur. Is that… is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, that is very helpful. Thank you for being so forthcoming. The color and consistency, as well as the association with urination, are important details. You mentioned it seems worse after you urinate; is there any pain or burning sensation during urination as well?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not exactly pain. More of… a slight stinging. Very brief. Barely noticeable, truthfully. I’ve had worse stubbing my toe, I can assure you. Though… now that you mention it, there is a bit of… discomfort afterward. A lingering… irritation. But I assumed that was just… well, age. Things don’t work the way they used to, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It's easy to dismiss changes as simply being "part of getting older." However, it's always best to investigate new symptoms. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Goodness. That’s… a long story. Let me see. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, of course. A bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing serious. My wife handles most of the doctor appointments, to be honest. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, I couldn’t say. Years, certainly. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And… I think that’s it. I had a bit of trouble with my prostate years ago, but they… removed something. A long time ago. Honestly, the details are rather… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krok. It's helpful to know about the arthritis, blood pressure medication, and the previous prostate issue. Do you happen to remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication name… oh dear. My wife keeps track of all that. It’s… a small white pill, as I said. Round, I believe. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I really couldn’t say the name. It begins with a… a letter, I suppose. Perhaps a ‘B’? Or a ‘P’? Honestly, Doctor, my memory is simply dreadful. I apologize. It's not intentional.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. Don't worry about it at all. We can look up the medication in your records. Now, let's move on to a few other questions. Have you had any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. Not that I've noticed. I might have felt a little… warm yesterday, but that was just the weather. It's been quite humid lately. Chills, no. And body aches… well, my joints ache most days, but that’s just the arthritis, as I said. Nothing unusual. I’ve been feeling… quite normal, all things considered. Except for… this issue, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I am a man of… respectable habits. A small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps. But nothing excessive. A bit of red wine, good for the heart, you know. My wife and I enjoy a quiet evening at home most nights. That’s about the extent of it. We are… rather simple people.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krok. Now, before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me see… I don’t believe so. My wife always checks the labels carefully. I might have had a bit of a rash once, years ago, after eating some… shellfish, perhaps? But it wasn’t serious. A little cream cleared it right up. Nothing that required a doctor’s visit. I don’t recall any… major allergies. I’m a fairly hardy man, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a gentle examination of your abdomen and groin area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An examination? Well… I suppose so. Though I must say, Doctor, I am not particularly fond of… being poked and prodded. But if it’s necessary… alright. Just… be gentle, please. And perhaps explain what you are doing as you go along? I am… a man of a certain age, you see. And my modesty… well, it's still intact.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concerns and will respect your modesty. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to gently palpate your abdomen. Are you experiencing any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just… a bit of pressure. My stomach… it's not what it used to be, you know. A bit sensitive, perhaps. But no sharp pain. Just… discomfort. It’s like… pressing on a balloon, perhaps? Soft, but… noticeable. And now… the groin area, you said? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Yes, the groin area. I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and discreet as possible. I'm feeling some mild tenderness here on the right side. Do you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little tenderness. Not sharp, mind you, but… a bit uncomfortable. It’s… a dull ache, really. And… now that you mention it, I think I do feel a… a slight swelling, perhaps? Just a little lump, under the skin. It’s been there for… a while, I think. I just assumed it was… age. Or perhaps a pulled muscle? I do enjoy a bit of gardening, you know.
DOCTOR: I see the lump you’re referring to, Mr. Krok. It is approximately the size of a marble and feels somewhat firm. Given your symptoms of discharge and tenderness, along with this lump, I suspect it may be a lymph node. Lymph nodes can become enlarged due to infection or inflammation. However, to rule out any other possibilities, I would like to order a few tests. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count. We’ll also need to perform a culture of the discharge to identify any bacteria present. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. More poking and prodding, I presume? Very well, Doctor. If it’s necessary. Though I must say, I am not fond of needles. My wife will be… most displeased. But if it’s to get to the bottom of this… alright. A urine analysis, a blood count, and… a culture, you said? Just… try to be quick, please. And explain everything as you go along? I am… a simple man, you know. I don’t understand all the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will explain everything in simple terms and be as quick as possible. The urine analysis is a simple test to check for infection. The blood count will give us an overview of your overall health and help us identify any signs of inflammation. The culture will help us pinpoint the specific bacteria causing the discharge, which will guide our treatment plan. The blood draw will be quick, and the urine sample is a simple matter of providing a cup. I’ll have my assistant come in shortly to collect these samples. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. Well… is it serious, Doctor? That’s what I’d like to know. Is it… something terrible? My wife… she worries terribly, you see. And I don’t want to cause her any unnecessary distress. And… will it affect my… gardening? I do enjoy my tomatoes, you know.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Mr. Krok. It's too early to say definitively what's causing your symptoms without the results of the tests. However, based on my initial examination, it doesn’t feel like anything immediately life-threatening. It's more likely an infection or inflammation, which we can typically treat with antibiotics. As for your gardening, it’s possible this may cause some temporary discomfort, but I don't anticipate it being a long-term issue. We’ll have a better idea once we have the test results, and we can discuss a treatment plan to get you back to your tomatoes as soon as possible. I want to be thorough, and getting these tests done will give us the best information to determine the right course of action. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… please be quick with the tests, Doctor. And explain everything to my wife, will you? She’ll want to know all the details. She's a very… practical woman, my wife. Needs to understand everything. Oh… and… thank you, Doctor. For being… gentle. And for not laughing. It’s… not easy, discussing these things.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Krok. I assure you, I will explain everything to your wife in detail, and I will be as thorough as possible. And please, know that you have no need to feel embarrassed. Discussing these things is part of my job, and I am here to help. My assistant, Sarah, will be in shortly to collect your samples. She’s very kind and will walk you through everything. I will call you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss the next steps. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… tell Sarah to be gentle, will you? And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… most kind. I believe I'll just… wait for Sarah, then.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will let Sarah know to be gentle. Please just relax, and I will be in touch as soon as I have the results.
