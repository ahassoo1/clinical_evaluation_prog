DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Kamahele, is it? Yes. Frankly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… the university. The students, mostly. It’s quite… draining, you understand. I’ve been a teacher for a very long time, and standards have… declined. Terribly. I suppose that’s what you want to know. I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand wanting to be brief. Though, to best help you, I do need to understand how this is draining you. Is it stress?
PATIENT: “Stress” is a rather… simplistic term, Doctor. It’s more a general… irritation. They don’t apply themselves. The apathy is astounding. I spend my days… repeating basic concepts. It’s… demoralizing. And the paperwork! Endless, pointless paperwork. Really, it’s a waste of a perfectly good mind. I used to conduct research, you know. Important research. Now… it’s just this.
DOCTOR: So, it sounds like you’re feeling quite frustrated with your work, and perhaps a sense of… loss, with not being able to focus on research as you once did. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms along with these feelings?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. I… I suppose my appetite isn’t what it used to be. And I sleep… fitfully. But that’s just age, I assure you. Perfectly normal. I don't need a lecture on geriatric ailments, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. It’s just… exhausting, being surrounded by… mediocrity. Is that what you want to know? Can we please expedite this?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Just trying to get a complete picture. Loss of appetite and trouble sleeping can be connected to stress, or other things. Has your weight changed recently, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Weight? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea. I don't weigh myself. It’s… vulgar, really. I’m… a reasonable size, I suppose. I haven’t been gaining weight, if that’s what you’re implying. And I certainly haven’t been losing any, not intentionally. It’s really quite irrelevant. Look, is there a test you can give me? Some sort of… diagnostic? Just to prove I’m perfectly sound, and that it’s just the… situation, you understand? The appalling state of modern education.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. We can do some basic tests. Before that, just to get a fuller understanding, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Really, Doctor. It’s… quite extensive, naturally, given my age. A few childhood illnesses, nothing remarkable. A broken wrist, many years ago. And… a rather unpleasant bout of influenza in 1987. But truly, nothing that would be relevant to this… situation. I assure you. I've always been a robust individual. Are you quite finished with these… inquiries? I have a rather important lecture to prepare, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just one more question then. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I eat everything. A sensible diet, naturally, but… no allergies. And medications… a small dose of something for my blood pressure, perhaps? Doctor Milenov prescribed it, years ago. I can’t recall the name. It’s… unimportant. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite… agitated. Can we simply proceed with the test? This is a waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure – just to confirm what you mentioned – and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, no unnecessary prodding. I'm not an invalid. Let's just get this over with. The sooner I can return to my lecture preparation, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll be as efficient as possible. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute. Lungs sound clear, but a bit shallow. Blood pressure is 142/90. A little high, as you suspected. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Coordination seems good. Overall, a fairly standard assessment for someone of your age, but your blood pressure is something we should address.
PATIENT: "Standard," you say? I assure you, Doctor, I was always exceptionally sharp. Always. And my blood pressure is likely elevated due to the… stress of dealing with incompetent students and endless bureaucracy. It’s hardly a medical anomaly. Honestly, I fail to see what this accomplishes. Is that it? Can I go now? I have a lecture to prepare. A very important lecture. I'd rather not waste any more of my time on… trivialities.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Given your insistence on stress being a major factor, and the fact that you've been generally healthy, we can start with some lifestyle modifications and monitoring your blood pressure at home. I’d like to recommend a blood pressure cuff so you can track your readings daily. I also recommend prioritizing relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or meditation. Would you be open to discussing some options?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques? Meditation? Doctor, with all due respect, I’ve spent a lifetime cultivating my intellect. I hardly need to be told to “relax.” And a blood pressure cuff? More gadgets to clutter my home. Honestly, it’s… insulting. Look, I came here because I thought you could offer a quick solution. Something to allow me to return to my work without further… complications. If you’re going to suggest endless monitoring and… self-help exercises, I’d rather simply accept my fate and continue as I am. Is there anything you can prescribe that will allow me to lower my blood pressure without resorting to such… nonsense? A pill, perhaps? Something simple? That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Given your preference, we can consider a low-dose antihypertensive medication. However, I strongly recommend regular monitoring of your blood pressure, even with medication, to ensure it’s effective and to minimize potential side effects. I’m going to prescribe Lisinopril 10mg daily. It’s a common medication with generally mild side effects. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one month so we can check your blood pressure and discuss how you’re feeling. It’s important to understand that medication is just one part of managing your blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications, like reducing stress and maintaining a healthy diet, are still important. Would you like me to provide you with some information on stress management techniques and healthy eating?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… fine. As long as it doesn’t require me to drastically alter my life. And no, thank you, I don’t require any pamphlets on “healthy eating” or… “stress management.” I’ve lived a long and productive life, Doctor. I think I know how to take care of myself. Just… write the prescription. And please, don’t waste any more of my time. I have a lecture to prepare. A very important lecture. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Here’s the prescription. Please remember to schedule a follow-up appointment in one month. If you experience any side effects, or if your blood pressure doesn’t improve, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. And… I wish you all the best with your lecture. .
