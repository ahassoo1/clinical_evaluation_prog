DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it's this itching, really. All over. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s… irritating, to say the least. Not dangerous, I don't think, but just really bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. Itching can be quite disruptive, even if it doesn’t seem dangerous. “A little while now” is a bit vague, so could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this itching?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? Around the middle of June, I’d say. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little… tickle, really. But it's gotten progressively worse, especially the last week or so. I can remember because my grandson, Leo, was visiting then, and I noticed it was bothering me even when I was trying to play with him.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks, starting around mid-June, and worsening over the last week – that gives me a better timeframe. And you noticed it interfering with activities, like playing with your grandson. Is the itching all over your body, or is it concentrated in specific areas?
PATIENT: It's pretty much everywhere, to be honest. My arms, my legs, my back… even my scalp feels a bit itchy. It’s not worse in any one spot, just… consistent. I don't think there's any redness or bumps, though. It’s just… an itch. A really annoying itch. I scratched a little at first, but I try not to now, because I don’t want to make it worse. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Consistent, all-over itching without visible rash is certainly something we need to investigate. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the itch, such as fatigue, weight loss, fever, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No fever, no tiredness more than usual, and my weight is about the same. Everything else feels pretty normal, honestly. My appetite is good, I sleep okay… just this itch. It's a bit of a mystery, isn't it? It’s not like I’ve been exposed to anything new, not that I can think of. I haven't changed soaps or detergents, and I haven’t been traveling.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does sound a bit puzzling. Let’s go through some of your medical history to see if we can uncover anything. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, but that cleared up years ago. I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Doctor prescribed it, a few years back now. I can’t remember the name offhand, but it’s not new. I’ve been on it a long time. And I’m generally a healthy man, if you don't mind me saying so. I try to eat well, and I walk every day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and it’s helpful that you’re generally healthy and active. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for blood pressure, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think the doctor said it started with an ‘A’… Amlodipine, maybe? Yes, I think that’s it! Amlodipine. It’s a small white pill, and I take 5 milligrams every morning. I keep it in a little plastic container on the kitchen counter. I’ve been taking it regularly, no missed doses. I'm pretty good about remembering my pills. It’s just the itch that’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily. Thank you for that information. Have you ever had any skin conditions in the past, such as eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: No, never. My skin has always been pretty good, actually. A little dry in the winter, but nothing serious. I never had any rashes or anything like that when I was a kid, and I haven't had any problems as an adult. My wife, bless her soul, always said I had good skin. She used to make me special lotions, but that was years ago now. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My mother had arthritis, quite bad towards the end. My father was generally healthy, lived to be 85. My sister had high blood pressure, but that's about it, really. No history of skin problems that I know of. It wasn’t something we talked about much, to be honest. We were more focused on other things, like work and raising families. It wasn’t a big medical family, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do understand. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn’t approve, and I didn’t want to disappoint her. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after she passed away. Didn’t feel right, you know? And I’ve never touched any of those other things. I prefer a good cup of tea, myself. And a quiet evening at home. I’m a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no significant changes in your lifestyle recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing really. I still walk every day, same route, same time. I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week, helping with the computers. I see my grandson, Leo, whenever I can. It's been a quiet year, honestly. Maybe a little lonely sometimes, but nothing out of the ordinary. The only thing that's really changed is this… itch. It’s really the only thing bothering me, and it just came on suddenly. That’s what’s so strange about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like there haven't been any major life changes that could be contributing to this. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin more closely. This will help me rule out some potential causes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a closer look at your skin. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, redness, or bumps. The skin appears dry overall, but there's no significant evidence of inflammation. No lesions or signs of infection apparent on your scalp either. The skin is generally unremarkable… just a bit dry. No tenderness noted on palpation. Everything appears normal on physical exam, which, while not definitive, does help us narrow down the possibilities. It’s a bit puzzling, frankly. Given the lack of visible rash and the persistent itching, we should run some blood tests to investigate further. This will help us assess your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any underlying systemic conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then let's do it. Blood tests sound fine. I'd like to know what's going on, and if that's the best way to find out, then I'm happy to cooperate. I trust your judgment. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. It’s just… bothersome, you know? I just want to get back to enjoying my walks and spending time with my grandson.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I agree, let's proceed with the blood tests. I'll order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will give us information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The CMP will assess your liver and kidney function, as well as your electrolyte levels. And the TSH test will check your thyroid function. The lab technician will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we can review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend using a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day to help soothe your skin. And avoid any harsh soaps or detergents. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. That all sounds sensible. So, just a little prick in the arm, and then we wait for the results? And in the meantime, keep my skin moisturized. I can do that. I guess I'm just a bit anxious, you know? It's not the discomfort of the itch itself, it's the unknown. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. I'm glad I came in. Do I need to fast before the blood tests? That’s probably a silly question. I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and not silly at all! Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We need to ensure accurate results for the CMP, and fasting is essential for that. We’ll get you a lab slip and instructions before you leave. It's best to schedule the test as early as possible tomorrow morning. The results should be available within 3-5 business days. Once they’re back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me. I really appreciate it. And thank you for reminding me about the fasting – I would have definitely forgotten! I’ll schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, as you suggested. And I'll try to relax and keep my skin moisturized in the meantime. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better now that we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get the lab slip printed for you on your way out. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I hope you have a pleasant evening and a good night's rest. We’ll be in touch soon. Please let the receptionist know you’re checking out. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye. .
