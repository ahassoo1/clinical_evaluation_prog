DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it's this pain in my side... keeps coming back, you see. And I seem to be getting water infections quite a bit these days as well. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's starting to wear me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and recurring water infections. That does sound frustrating, especially when it's been going on for a while. Let’s start with the side pain. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, frustrating is a good word for it. It's mostly on my right side, lower down, like where your hip bone is. It’s not always sharp, sometimes it’s just a dull ache. It comes and goes, but it's been happening more often lately. And sometimes it radiates around to my back, you know? It’s hard to describe exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It is often hard to describe pain. Radiating to the back is important information. Is there anything specific that seems to trigger the pain – certain movements, activities, or times of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really anything specific, Doctor. I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem to be worse after eating, or with exercise... I haven't been doing much exercise lately, mind you. It just… comes on. Sometimes when I’m just sitting, sometimes when I’m walking. It’s very unpredictable, which makes it difficult to plan things.
DOCTOR: I see. Unpredictable pain is definitely more challenging. And you mentioned it's been happening more often lately – can you give me a rough estimate of how frequently you're experiencing this pain now, compared to, say, six months ago?
PATIENT: Let me think… Six months ago, maybe once a month? Now… it feels like at least two or three times a week, sometimes more. It's really starting to bother me, and I worry about it all the time. It keeps me up at night sometimes too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a significant increase in frequency, and the impact on your sleep is concerning. We’ll want to investigate that further. Now, let's talk about these recurring water infections. How often would you say you’re getting those, and have you been treated for them each time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the water infections. It’s probably about once a month as well, maybe a little more. And yes, I’ve been to the doctor each time, and they’ve given me antibiotics. They seem to help while I'm taking them, but then it comes back a few weeks later. It’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: A cycle is a good way to put it, and it's good you've been seeking treatment each time. Okay, so approximately monthly for both the side pain and the water infections, with the antibiotics providing temporary relief for the infections. Before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask about any other symptoms you're experiencing. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, changes in your bowel habits, or blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, thankfully. No nausea or vomiting either. My bowel habits are… regular, I suppose. Nothing much changed there. But… …yes, I have noticed blood in my urine sometimes. Not every time, but it's happened a few times now. It's usually just a little, but it worries me, of course. It’s usually at the end of urination, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make a difference. Blood in the urine, even a small amount, is something we need to investigate. We’ll definitely want to rule out any serious causes. Okay, Mr. Espinueva, I'm going to perform a physical exam now. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently press on your sides and back to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. I’ll also need to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please do what you need to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this and hopefully find some relief. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Please lie back comfortably on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please try to breathe normally. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit diminished. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain, and if so, where and how severe it is. We'll start on your right side... Okay, and how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that's a bit tender, Doctor. Right there… about halfway down on my right side. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like a bruise. It doesn't radiate out when you press on it, just… uncomfortable. It's definitely worse when you press down, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting the tenderness on your right side, mid-abdomen. Now, I'm going to gently press along your back. Please let me know if you feel any pain there as well. And how about here, along your spine?
PATIENT: That’s… a little uncomfortable, but not as bad as my side. It's more of a general ache, like old muscles. I have always had a bit of trouble with my back, to be honest. It doesn't feel connected to the pain in my side, though, if that makes sense. It's just my usual back trouble.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It's good to know the distinction. Alright, I’m going to check your reflexes now. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Please keep your legs relaxed. And now your ankle reflexes. Reflexes are two plus bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I want to listen to your lungs just to rule out any respiratory causes of discomfort. Take a deep breath for me. Lungs are clear. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, I think we need to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever tests are needed. I’m just eager to find out what’s causing all this trouble. What sort of tests are you thinking of? And will they be painful? I worry about needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll try to minimize any discomfort. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a urinalysis to look for blood and signs of infection in your urine. We’ll also do a urine culture to identify any bacteria present. And finally, I’d like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast to get a more detailed look at your kidneys, ureters, bladder, and other organs in your abdomen. The blood work will involve a small sample taken from your arm – a quick pinch. The urinalysis is just a sample of your urine. The CT scan will require an IV to administer the contrast dye, which some people feel a warm sensation from. It’s a relatively quick scan, and the technician will explain everything thoroughly. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or iodine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I've had scans before, a few years back now, and I didn’t have any problems. I don't recall any allergies to anything, to be honest. I’m a bit worried about the IV, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgement. I just hope it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the previous scans. And I understand your apprehension about the IV. It’s usually quite quick, and the nurse is very skilled at inserting them. Okay, so we'll proceed with the CBC, CMP, urinalysis, and CT scan with contrast. I’ll write up the orders now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions about the CT scan appointment. It’s best to drink plenty of water between now and the scan to help your kidneys flush out the contrast dye. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to start you on a course of antibiotics to address the possible urinary infection. I’ll prescribe a seven-day course of nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day. Please take it with food to minimize any stomach upset. Do you have any questions about the medications or the tests so far?
PATIENT: Seven days of antibiotics, that sounds good. Nitrofurantoin… I’ve not taken that one before, but I’ll make sure I take it with my meals. And I'll drink plenty of water, as you said. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just hope we can get to the bottom of this soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your hope, Mr. Espinueva, and we'll do our best. I will review the test results as soon as they are available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you experience any fever, chills, worsening pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Here’s a written summary of the instructions, the antibiotic prescription, and the lab orders. Do you need help scheduling the CT scan appointment?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind scheduling the CT scan, that would be wonderful. I’m not very good with these things myself. Thank you for all your help so far. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, I've scheduled you for a CT scan at Radiologic Imaging Center on August 5th at 10:00 AM. You’ll need to arrive 15 minutes early to complete the necessary paperwork. Remember to drink plenty of water before your appointment. They'll ask you about any allergies and medical conditions, and they will explain the procedure thoroughly. They will also advise you about any dietary restrictions. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: August 5th at 10:00 AM… Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. That gives me a few days to drink plenty of water! Thank you very much, Doctor. I think that’s everything for now. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll see you at my follow-up appointment then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad we were able to get everything scheduled. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
