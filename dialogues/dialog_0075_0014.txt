DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Panjoj. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see... Oh, right. It's about some papers, I think. My wife, she said something about needing forms? For... time off work, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something with the company and... being sick? I just want to get it sorted, if you could help.
DOCTOR: Alright, so your wife is requesting some time off work due to illness and needs me to complete some forms. Do you know what kind of illness she's experiencing, or what her employer requires on these forms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, it’s me needing the forms, not my wife! She just handles the paperwork, bless her. And... illness? Well, I’ve been feeling… off. Tired, mostly. And a bit weak. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a bad cold, just… not my usual self. As for what the company needs… no, I haven’t a clue. Something about… FMLA, maybe? She mentioned letters. I really don’t keep up with these things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco, no problem at all. FMLA – Family and Medical Leave Act – that’s likely what we’re dealing with. It allows employees time off for medical reasons. Let’s start with understanding what’s been going on with you. You mentioned feeling tired and weak. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it started… oh, I don’t know, a few weeks ago, maybe? Just… less energy. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now, I need to sit down after a bit. And I… forget things easier. Little things, mostly. Like names, or where I put my keys. It’s… frustrating. It’s not sudden, just… a slow fading, I guess. Does that make sense? I used to be so sharp.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A gradual onset of fatigue and some memory difficulties. And is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I think. But some days are worse than others. Like, if I try to do too much, it really knocks me out. Even just walking the dog feels like a big effort sometimes. And… well, my wife notices it more than I do, I think. She keeps telling me I’m slowing down. She’s probably right. It’s just… hard to admit, you know? I’ve always been a strong, healthy man.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s often difficult to acknowledge changes in our health. Let's try to get a better picture of what might be going on. Besides the fatigue and memory issues, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… maybe a bit of trouble sleeping? I used to sleep like a log. Now I wake up a few times during the night. And… now that you mention it, my appetite hasn’t been great. I haven’t lost a lot of weight, but I don’t feel hungry like I used to. It’s all a bit… vague, honestly. I’m not sure what’s normal anymore. It's just a general feeling of… being unwell. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, memory issues, trouble sleeping, and decreased appetite. That gives us a little more to work with. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you experienced any pain, any changes in your vision, any dizziness, or any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. A few aches and pains, like you get when you’re getting old, but nothing specific. Vision… no changes that I've noticed. And no dizziness. Bowel… well, everything seems normal there, if you don't mind me saying. Sorry to be so… blunt. It’s all a bit embarrassing talking about these things. I'm not used to going to doctors. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s important to be honest, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. A few bumps and scrapes over the years, but nothing that needed much attention. My wife always tells me I need to see the doctor more often, but I just… never have. She keeps track of all that stuff, so I honestly don't know. She's the one with the medical records, I’m sure. Is it alright if I ask her when I get home? I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: Actually, Mr. Limtiaco, I'm seeing some records here. You were diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, and you've had a few elevated cholesterol readings as well. It looks like you were prescribed lisinopril for the blood pressure, but it's been discontinued. Do you recall that?
PATIENT: Oh! Now you mention it... yes, yes, I think I do remember something like that. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. And I tried those pills… but they made me feel… funny. A bit dizzy, I think. And my wife said I was more irritable. So, I stopped taking them. She said, “Oh, you don’t need those,” and… well, I trusted her. She’s always right about these things. I honestly forgot all about it. It was just a little thing, I thought. I’m so sorry. It’s all a bit… muddled in my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were previously diagnosed with hypertension and discontinued lisinopril due to side effects. That’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies? Let me see… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife says I’m lucky that way. She always checks everything before I take anything, just to be safe. I really rely on her. Honestly, I'm drawing a blank. I think I'd remember something like an allergy. I’m usually pretty good with remembering things like that… or at least, I used to be. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, nothing at all. Not since I stopped the blood pressure pills. My wife says too many pills are bad for you. She’s a big believer in natural remedies. She makes me drink all sorts of teas and… things. Honestly, I don’t even know what’s in them. She just says they're good for my health. She’s very… particular about what I put in my body. I just take what she gives me. And… well, that’s it. I’m a pretty simple man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, and if an exam will help, then go right ahead. I’m a bit worried, to be honest, but I'm glad I came in. I hope you can figure out what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step over here and lie down on the table, that would be great. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then check your reflexes and blood pressure. I'm listening to your heart now… sounds are a little faint, but regular. No murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Blood pressure is currently 140/90. A little elevated, but not dangerously high. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Balance is slightly off, but again, not alarming. Your coordination seems mostly intact. Everything seems relatively stable, Mr. Limtiaco, but your blood pressure is a bit high, your reflexes are diminished, and your balance is slightly impaired. Given your history and the symptoms you’ve described, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work, yes. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong, and if blood tests will help, then please, go ahead. My wife will be glad I’m getting things checked out properly. She's always telling me I need to be more proactive about my health. It's just… a lot to take in. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab technician will draw some blood here in the clinic. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you try to get a little more rest, eat a healthy diet, and avoid strenuous activity. It's also important to stay hydrated. Given your history of hypertension and the current blood pressure reading, I’m going to start you on a low dose of lisinopril again, if you’re comfortable with that. We can monitor your blood pressure closely to make sure it doesn’t cause any side effects. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Lisinopril again? Oh… I don’t know, Doctor. I remember feeling… unwell when I took it before. Dizzy, and… irritable, like my wife said. I don’t want to feel like that again. But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary… I trust your judgment, but I’m a bit worried about the side effects. Is there anything else I could try? Perhaps… a different medication? Or… maybe just try to manage it with diet and exercise? I just… don’t want to feel bad again. And I don’t want to upset my wife if I stop taking it once you prescribe it. She gets so… concerned.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly reasonable to be hesitant about restarting a medication that caused side effects in the past. We can certainly explore other options. There are other blood pressure medications available, yes. However, given your history, lisinopril is often a good first-line choice. We can start with a very low dose—lower than what you took before—and monitor you very closely for any side effects. If you experience any discomfort, we can stop it immediately and switch to a different medication. Alternatively, we can try a more conservative approach—diet and exercise—for a few weeks and see if we can get your blood pressure under control that way. However, given your current reading, it may not be enough. We would need to check your blood pressure frequently to ensure it doesn't get too high. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Mr. Limtiaco. I want you to feel comfortable with whatever we decide. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I really don’t like the idea of feeling bad again. The dizziness… and upsetting my wife… Perhaps… let’s try the low dose, then. But if I feel unwell at all, promise me we can stop it right away. And… could you maybe give me something for the dizziness, just in case? And… maybe a note to show my wife, explaining why we’re doing this, so she doesn’t get too worried? She gets so anxious about my health. She's a good woman, but… she worries a lot. Yes, please. A low dose, and a note for my wife. And something for the dizziness.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. We can definitely do that. I'm prescribing a very low dose of lisinopril—5mg once daily—and I'm also prescribing a medication for motion sickness—meclizine—which can help with the dizziness if it occurs. You can take it as needed. Here's the prescription for both medications, and here's a note for your wife explaining why we’re starting lisinopril and what to watch out for. It also includes my contact information, so she can reach me if she has any concerns. I want you to know that I’m here for you, Mr. Limtiaco. If you experience any side effects at all, please don't hesitate to call me. We can always adjust the medication or switch to something else. I also want to emphasize the importance of regular check-ups. We’ll need to monitor your blood pressure closely, and I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. The note for my wife is a great help. And knowing I can call you if I feel unwell… that puts my mind at ease. Two weeks… yes, that’s good. I’ll schedule the appointment right away. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. Thank you for listening to my worries. I feel much better now. I think… I think that’s everything. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Limtiaco, I think that’s everything for today. Just remember to take the medications as prescribed, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And try to get some rest! It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. I'm going to have the nurse come in to review the discharge instructions with you one more time before you leave, just to make sure you have all the information you need. Take care of yourself, Mr. Limtiaco. And don't worry—we’ll figure this out together.
