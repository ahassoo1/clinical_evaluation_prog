DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Reisig, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I reckon. My daughter… she's trying to get her husband over here from… well, a ways away. And I understand there's paperwork and things, and vaccinations he needs to be able to come. I'm trying to help her sort it all out, but I'm a bit lost on what exactly is required.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. It sounds like you’re assisting your daughter with her husband’s immigration process, and vaccinations are a necessary part of that. I'm happy to help clarify what's needed. To start, could you tell me a bit more about where he’s coming from?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Helping her out where I can. He's coming from… let me see… Ukraine. That’s where he's from, yes. It’s been… difficult for him, naturally. She met him while she was teaching over there a few years back. A good man, but… a long way from home.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. Knowing he’s coming from Ukraine is very helpful. The required vaccinations will depend on his age and vaccination history. Do you happen to know if he has a record of his vaccinations?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t think she does. Things were… different over there when he was younger, you know? Records weren’t always kept as well as they are here. She asked him, but he wasn't sure. He said he had some shots as a boy, but nothing specific that she could tell me. He doesn’t have any papers or anything like that. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that records might be incomplete. Not having documentation doesn't necessarily mean we can't proceed, but it does mean we’ll likely need to administer some vaccinations to ensure he meets the requirements. To be certain, we’ll need to review what’s currently recommended for individuals immigrating from Ukraine. And, of course, to best determine his needs, I’d like to ask a few questions about his medical history, if you don't mind. First, do you know his date of birth?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. I appreciate you explaining it. She did tell me his birthday… let me see if I can recall it correctly… It’s March 15th, 1982. Yes, that’s right, March 15th, 1982. I hope I remembered that correctly. She’s very eager to have him here, and I want to get this right for her.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. March 15th, 1982 – that’s very helpful. Let me just confirm that in the system... Okay, perfect. So, given his date of birth, he's currently 43 years old. Typically, at his age, the recommended vaccinations for immigration include verification of measles, mumps, rubella , tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis , varicella , polio, influenza, and hepatitis B. We will also need to consider COVID-19 vaccination. Have you or your daughter discussed any specific requirements from the immigration authorities?
PATIENT: No, we haven't. She mostly just… read something online about needing shots, and the forms mentioned something about a doctor’s visit. She isn’t very good with paperwork, and I offered to come with her to sort it out. We didn’t really get any specifics about which shots, just that they were needed. She just wants to be sure he can come here legally and safely, you know? Is there a list I can take to her? Something that spells it all out?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed with the immigration paperwork. I can absolutely provide you with a list detailing the required vaccinations, as per the CDC guidelines for individuals immigrating from Ukraine. Here you go. This document outlines everything that is generally required. It also includes information about the age requirements and any potential waivers. Now, while this is a good starting point, to determine exactly what vaccinations he needs, I’d like to ask a few questions about his past medical history. Have you or your daughter ever been made aware of any specific medical conditions he has?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. She said he had a bad case of the flu a few years back, while he was still in Ukraine. A really bad one, she said he was in bed for nearly a month. But other than that… not really. He seems like a very healthy man, strong and active. He worked as a carpenter, you know? A skilled craftsman. She didn’t mention anything about any long-term illnesses or conditions. Does that flu count as something I should mention?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Skarbek. A severe case of the flu is certainly relevant. While it doesn’t necessarily preclude him from immigrating, we want to ensure he has fully recovered and doesn’t have any lasting complications. Has he ever been hospitalized for any reason, aside from that flu?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. She said he always avoided doctors if he could. Old-fashioned sort of man, she said. Preferred folk remedies and resting it off. She had to practically drag him to a doctor when he had that bad flu, and even then, he wasn’t too happy about it. She said he’s a bit stubborn, but a good man at heart. Is that helpful information, Doctor? I don't want to bore you with stories.
DOCTOR: That’s actually quite helpful, Mr. Skarbek. Knowing his history of avoiding medical care gives me a better understanding of his potential vaccination status and any hesitancy he might have. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies he might have. Does he have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. That’s a good question. She didn’t mention any food allergies, no. And he doesn’t seem to have any sensitivities to anything around the house. But… she did say he was stung by a bee once when he was a boy, and his arm swelled up pretty badly. She said he was very sick for a few days afterward. Is that something I should tell you? I’m not sure if that counts as a serious allergy, but I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very important to know, Mr. Skarbek. A significant reaction to a bee sting definitely counts as an allergy. We need to document that. That suggests a potential for anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction. We'll need to be prepared for that during any vaccinations. Now, one last question regarding his medical history before we move on to a physical exam. Does he currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, he doesn't take anything regularly. She said he’s a very simple man, doesn’t believe in relying on pills and potions. When he has a headache, he’ll just rest or drink some tea. He’s very particular about what he puts into his body, she said. Very healthy lifestyle, mostly. He eats a lot of vegetables from his garden, and he’s always active. I think that’s all she told me about his medical history, Doctor. I hope I haven’t left anything out. I’m trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Skarbek. You’ve provided a very thorough overview of his medical history. It sounds like he’s generally a very healthy individual. Now, with his consent, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess his overall health and check for any contraindications to vaccination. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: No, he isn't. He's still in Ukraine, as you know. She’s the one who’s been handling most of the paperwork, and she encouraged me to come speak with you so she can be prepared when he arrives. I’m hoping to be able to take a list back to her with everything he'll need. Would you be able to give me something to show him when he gets here? Something that explains the vaccinations and what to expect? I’m sure he’ll have questions.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. That’s perfectly understandable. We can proceed with gathering information and preparing a plan for when he arrives. Given that he isn't here today, I can’t perform a physical exam. However, I can still review the general vaccination requirements and provide you with educational materials to share with him. Here's a summary of the vaccinations he'll likely need, based on his age and immigration status. This document also outlines the potential side effects of each vaccine, so he's aware of what to expect. And this is a general consent form for vaccinations. He’ll need to sign this before receiving any vaccines. Given his history of avoiding medical care and his bee sting allergy, it would be prudent to discuss these concerns with him before administering any vaccines. We may want to consider having epinephrine available in case of an allergic reaction. Do you have any questions about these materials or the vaccination process?
PATIENT: No, that all seems very clear, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. The information about the bee sting allergy is especially helpful. I’ll make sure to emphasize that to her, and we’ll talk to him about it when he arrives. Having the epinephrine on hand sounds like a very good idea. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve really put my mind at ease, and I feel much better prepared now. Is there anything else I need to do or bring when he comes for the shots? Perhaps a record of any previous vaccinations he did receive, even if it’s just a rough estimate?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad I could help. Regarding additional documentation, any record of previous vaccinations, even if incomplete, would be helpful, but it's not essential. We can proceed even without it. It’s also a good idea to bring his insurance information, if he has it. Mostly, encourage him to be open and honest about his medical history and any concerns he may have. And, if he experiences any unexpected side effects after receiving the vaccines, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I believe that covers everything for now. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions. We look forward to welcoming him to the clinic when he arrives. Have a good day, Mr. Skarbek.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. You have been most helpful. We will certainly contact you if we have any questions. Have a good day to you as well. .
