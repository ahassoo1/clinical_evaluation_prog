DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning Doctor. Right, well… it’s my ear, you see. Feels blocked, like something’s… full. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. A while. It’s just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: “A while,” is… not terribly helpful, I'm afraid. But we can work with that. Is it painful at all, or just the sensation of fullness?
PATIENT: No, not painful, no. Just… muffled. Like when you go up high in a plane, you know? That feeling. It’s not constant, either. Comes and goes. I… did have a bit of a cold a few weeks back, maybe? Or was it last month? See, it’s all a bit fuzzy. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. A cold… sometime recently. And has anything specifically made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. I mean, lying down doesn’t seem to change it. Loud noises… well, they just seem loud, obviously. I work outside, a lot, so there are loud noises. Agricultural inspections, you see. Makes it a bit hard to hear sometimes, when it’s blocked. I… don't know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Agricultural inspections. Interesting. And do you use any hearing protection during these inspections?
PATIENT: Hearing protection? Oh, uh… sometimes. When it’s really loud. It’s… not always practical, you know? Lots of moving around, checking fields, talking to people. It’s a bit awkward wearing big earmuffs while you’re trying to have a conversation. I mostly just try to… avoid the worst of it. Don't always succeed, mind you.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, avoiding it isn’t typically a sustainable solution, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Let’s have a quick look at your ear, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… quick, if you could? I have a lot on today, you see. Inspections… they don't wait for anyone.
DOCTOR: Of course. This won’t take long. Just tilt your head slightly to the left… Excellent. Hmm… there’s some cerumen build-up. And the tympanic membrane… looks a little dull. Similar on this side. Moderate cerumen impaction bilaterally. No obvious signs of acute infection, but the build-up is significant.
PATIENT: Cerumen… impaction? Is that… bad? Look, I don't pretend to know medical terms, Doctor. Just… is it fixable? Will I be able to hear properly again? I really need to be able to hear when people are talking to me. It's important for my job.
DOCTOR: It's not serious, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, but it is certainly impacting your hearing. The wax is blocking your ear canal. Fortunately, it’s relatively straightforward to address. We can remove it with irrigation or manual extraction. I recommend irrigation, it’s less… invasive.
PATIENT: Irrigation… alright, that sounds… less bad than extraction, I suppose. Is it… uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I really shouldn’t be away from work for too long, you understand. Inspections… they pile up quickly. And will it definitely work? I don't want to come back in a week with the same problem.
DOCTOR: It can be slightly uncomfortable, a brief sensation of pressure, like water in your ear. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes per ear. And while it's generally very effective, there's always a small chance some wax might remain, requiring a repeat procedure. We'll do our best to remove as much as possible during this visit, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Do you have any allergies to ear drops?
PATIENT: Ear drops… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven’t used them in years, if ever. My wife… she usually handled all that sort of thing. It’s been a while since… well, never mind. So, no allergies, as far as I remember. Can we just get it over with then, Doctor? The sooner I can hear properly, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with the irrigation then. I'll have the nurse prepare the necessary equipment. Just lie down on the examination table, and we'll get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s get it done, then. Hope it doesn't take too long. Inspections, you know. They won't do themselves.
DOCTOR: Yes, inspections. Always the inspections. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. This might be a little chilly. I’m going to gently flush your ear canal with warm water. Let me know immediately if you experience any pain or dizziness.
PATIENT: Oh, that is chilly. And a bit… strange. Feels like water in my sinuses. But no pain, not yet. Just… cold and weird. Is it supposed to feel like that?
DOCTOR: It’s normal to feel some pressure and a sensation of fullness, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s the water dislodging the wax. Hmm… it's starting to clear up. Just try to relax. Alright, that should be sufficient for now. Let's do the other ear.
PATIENT: Alright. Get it over with. This other one… feels a little worse already, if that’s possible. Feels more… blocked. Honestly, I think I’ve had this problem for ages. Just… hurry, if you could, Doctor? Inspections are piling up, and I don't want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. There we go. Much better. And that's that. Alright. That should resolve the majority of the blockage. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Well… it feels different. Not sure if it’s better, exactly. It's… quieter, maybe? Hard to say. Everything just sounds… muffled still. Like there's still something there. But it’s not as… full, I suppose. I… honestly, it's hard to tell. I’ll probably need to wait until I’m back outside, with all the noise, to really know. Is there anything else you can do?
DOCTOR: Well, we've removed a significant amount of cerumen from both ears, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Sometimes, it takes a little time for your hearing to fully return to normal after a blockage. However, given your occupation and the persistent muffled sensation, I recommend a formal audiometry test. It will allow us to assess the extent of any residual hearing loss. I'll write you a referral to an audiologist. If the test reveals any significant impairment, we can discuss further options. But frankly, given your lack of hearing protection and constant exposure to loud noises, it's likely there's some degree of noise-induced hearing loss already present. You really need to prioritize hearing protection, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s essential for preserving your hearing long-term.
PATIENT: An audiometry test… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. But honestly, I’m not sure I have time for all these tests. Inspections… they take up all my time. And I’ve been doing this job for years, and I can still hear, mostly. Look, I’ll think about the hearing protection. But right now, I just need to get back to work. Can I at least get a copy of this referral?
DOCTOR: Very well. Here’s the referral. The audiologist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I strongly advise you to follow up with them promptly. Ignoring a potential hearing loss will only worsen the situation, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. And while I understand your busy schedule, your health should be your priority. Now, if you have no further questions, I suggest you get back to your inspections. But please, consider investing in some proper hearing protection. It’s a small price to pay for preserving your hearing for years to come. .
