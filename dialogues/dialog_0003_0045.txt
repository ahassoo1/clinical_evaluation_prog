DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Yackey. Now, let's get straight to the point, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, please. Straight to the point is good. It’s this… flushing. Happens sometimes. Not always, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Flushing. And when does this… flushing occur, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s… mostly on my face, you see? And neck. Sometimes chest. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… warm. And red. I notice it after I eat, usually. Not everything I eat, though. It's… hard to say what brings it on. Sometimes spicy food, but not always. Last time, it was just a sandwich. Plain turkey sandwich.
DOCTOR: A plain turkey sandwich, you say. Interesting. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… six months? Seven? It started slow, just a little color, you wouldn’t even notice. Now… well, now it’s more obvious. My daughter pointed it out. She worries, you know? Good girl, that Priya.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are there any other symptoms that accompany this flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Sometimes my heart feels… a little fast. Not racing, just… aware of it. And… maybe a little dizzy. But that doesn't happen every time. And no headaches, no nothing like that. Just the warm face and sometimes the heart. It goes away pretty quick, usually. Within… fifteen, twenty minutes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I always been… small. 121 pounds, always. Maybe a little up, a little down, but nothing to write home about. I eat regular. Not much junk food, you know? Mostly rice, vegetables, a little chicken. Simple things.
DOCTOR: And your daughter mentioned this started about six months ago, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. About six months. She came to visit and said, “Papa, your face is very red.” She's got a good eye, Priya does. Always notices things. And she worries if I don't eat enough, or if I'm out in the sun too long. She’s a good girl. A very good girl.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Never been much of a medicine man, you see? I try to stay healthy. Rice and vegetables, fresh air… that’s what keeps me going. Used to go for walks every day, before… before my wife passed. Now… it's harder to get motivated, you know? But no pills, no nothing.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a problem with anything, really. Eat most things. Sometimes a little gas from the beans, but that's just… beans, you know? Nothing serious. Not an allergy. Never been to the hospital for allergies or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your family history… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… That’s a good question. My mother, she had… problems with her stomach. Not sure what, exactly. We didn't have doctors back then, you see? Rural village, everything was different. And my father… he was a strong man. Always healthy. No, I don't think so. Nothing major that I know of. My wife… she had high blood pressure, I think. But that was later in life. It's all a little fuzzy, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I see. And finally, do you drink alcohol or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a drop of alcohol. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife… she didn't like it. Said it was bad for your health. And I agreed with her. Always been a healthy man, mostly. Until this flushing, you know? Just want to figure out what's causing it. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Withycombe. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to perform a quick physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll need to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. And… is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, Mr. Withycombe. Just a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope. Nothing to worry about. Now, relax your arm for me… good. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, but a slight murmur is present. It's faint, but worth noting. I’ll document that. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Skin appears normal, with some mild flushing noted on the face and neck. Alright. Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That will be all for the examination.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Glad it didn't involve needles. So, what do you think it is? Is it something serious? That murmur… is that bad? My heart feels okay, most of the time. Just a little fast sometimes, like I said.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Withycombe, based on what you've told me, and the findings of the physical examination, it’s difficult to say definitively. The flushing, combined with the occasional palpitations and the murmur… could indicate a number of things. Given your age and the lack of other significant symptoms, I suspect it may be rosacea with some associated cardiac changes. However, a murmur always warrants further investigation. To be certain, I would like to order a few tests. Specifically, I recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying inflammation. I'd also suggest a thyroid panel, just to be thorough. We’ll also need a urine sample for analysis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: EKG… and blood tests? Urine sample… That sounds… complicated. How much will all of this cost? I don't have insurance, Doctor. I'm a widower, you see? It's just me. I try to save where I can. And… what if it is something serious? I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. The costs can be… significant without insurance. I will see if the clinic offers a payment plan, or if there are any assistance programs available. As for the tests themselves, we need to determine the cause of your symptoms. Ignoring them could lead to more serious complications down the line. The EKG is relatively inexpensive, perhaps $75. The blood count and thyroid panel will be around $150. The urine analysis is the least expensive, about $25. I can also write a referral to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation if the EKG shows any abnormalities. They, of course, would have their own fees. Given your history, I recommend proceeding with the initial blood work and EKG. We can discuss the results and formulate a plan from there. Do you agree?
PATIENT: $250… That’s… a lot of money, Doctor. But… I don't want to ignore it, like you said. It’s just… difficult. Okay. Yes. Do the tests. The EKG and the blood work. But… can you help me with a payment plan? I can pay a little bit each month, maybe? And… will you explain the results to me clearly? I don't understand a lot of medical terms. I just want to know what’s going on with my heart.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Withycombe. I will speak with the clinic administrator to see what payment options are available. I can assure you, I will explain the results in plain language, avoiding technical jargon as much as possible. My priority is to ensure you understand your condition and treatment plan. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood samples now. And I’ll write the order for the EKG. The nurse will explain how to schedule that. Just try to relax. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, let’s get these tests ordered. Nurse Patel will be in shortly. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for helping me. And… thank you for explaining things clearly. It makes me feel… a little better, knowing you’re trying to help. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. I'll be reviewing your chart in the meantime. Nurse Patel will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
