DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Pipkorn. Real pleasure’s all mine. Well, it's this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, see? It’s been botherin’ me for…oh, goodness, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you say it's located at the back of the head. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not like a throbbing, you know? More like a… a steady pressure. A tightness. Sometimes feels like somethin’s pullin’ back there. Not sharp, thankfully. More… dull. And it kinda radiates, spreads a little bit to the sides of my head, if that makes sense. It doesn’t make me wanna lie down in a dark room, but it’s definitely distracting. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Steady pressure, tightness, radiating to the sides… not sharp, thankfully. And it hasn’t been accompanied by any nausea, vomiting, or vision changes, correct?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. And my eyes are seein’ just fine, as far as I can tell. Everything's lookin’ clear. I did bump my head a little while back, helpin’ my grandson with a…well, it was a complicated treehouse project. But that was…oh, must be six months ago now? Didn’t think much of it at the time, just a little bump. But I wondered if maybe it was somethin’ to do with this headache. Could be, right?
DOCTOR: A head injury six months prior… that's good to know. And was there any loss of consciousness or dizziness at the time of the injury?
PATIENT: No, no knockin' out or anything like that. Just a little "ow" moment. I just rubbed it, felt around, made sure nothin' was broken, and carried on. Didn't feel dizzy then, and haven't felt dizzy since. It wasn't a hard bump, you know? Just kinda walked into a low-hangin' branch. It was more embarrassing than painful, to be honest! But I always worry these things could come back to haunt you, even the small ones.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s wise to consider all possibilities. Now, let's get a bit of your medical background. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was gettin’ a little high, so he put me on a small pill for it. I take that every mornin'. Other than that… not much, really. My knees ache a little sometimes, like most folks my age, but the doctor never said it was arthritis or anything serious. Just old age creepin’ in, I guess! I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright, hypertension managed with medication… and some age-related joint discomfort. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… names have never been my strong suit. Let me see… it’s a little white pill… small… starts with an ‘A’ I think? Amlodipine? Is that right? Or something close to it. My daughter helps me refill it, so she’d know for sure. I just take it like I’m supposed to, every mornin’ with my coffee. I don't like messin' with pills unless I have to. It's been workin' pretty well, thankfully. Keeps the doctor happy, at least!
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, correct. And how about any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' that I know of. I used to get a little itchy when I was a kid around certain flowers, but I outgrew that. Never had a bad reaction to any medicine, thankfully. My wife used to worry about that, always askin' before I took anything new, but she… well, that was a long time ago. But no, no allergies that I’m aware of. Clean bill of health in that department, knock on wood again.
DOCTOR: Very good. And just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you’re currently taking besides the amlodipine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Besides the blood pressure pill… nothin' really. Oh, wait! My grandson got me tryin' these little chewable vitamins. He says they're good for energy. They taste like orange slices. He calls 'em… somethin' with a 'C' in it? Calcium? No, Vitamin C! Yeah, Vitamin C chewables. But I only take 'em when he reminds me. He’s very diligent about my health, that boy. I don’t take 'em every day, just… now and then. It's probably not even worth mentionin', but you asked!
DOCTOR: Vitamin C supplements, intermittent use. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological assessment and check your vital signs. Is that alright with you, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Sounds good to me. Whatever you need to do. I always trust the young doctors. You all went to school for a reason, right? Go right ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… funny.
DOCTOR: Of course. First, let's check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I'm noting a blood pressure of 148/86, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.2 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to assess your reflexes and cranial nerves. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. There we go, keepin' right up with you. My eyes aren't what they used to be for readin' small print, but they still work okay for followin' a finger, thankfully. This is just like when they checked my eyes at the DMV, right?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly concerning for your age. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Sure thing. How’s that? I try to keep my grip strong, but these old hands don’t work like they used to. I used to be able to chop wood all day, but now… well, now I mostly just drink coffee.
DOCTOR: I’m palpating your head and neck now. Do you feel any tenderness in these areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little bit at the very base of my skull, right where the headache usually is. It’s not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache when you press on it. Like a bruise, almost, but not swollen or anything. It's probably just where I've been rubbin' it, tryin' to make it go away. Just a little sensitivity there, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Based on the physical exam and your history, it could be tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in the neck. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the headache, and the diminished reflexes, I would like to order a few tests to rule out other possibilities. Would you be willing to have some blood work done, including a complete blood count and a thyroid panel?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Well, I don't love needles, but if it’ll help figure out what's goin’ on, I guess I can do it. I always get a little lightheaded after, so maybe I should bring my daughter with me next time? She’s good at keepin' me calm. A thyroid panel… is that somethin’ serious? I've never had one of those before. But yeah, okay. If you think it's best, I'll get the blood work done. Just let me know where to go.
DOCTOR: A thyroid panel is just to check your thyroid function; it can sometimes cause headaches. And yes, bringing your daughter would be a good idea. I'll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab across the street at St. Luke's Hospital. They're open until 5 PM today. Now, while we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to see if that helps with the tension. It’s not a long-term solution, but it may provide some relief. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, like I said before. I always worry about side effects, though. Will it make me drowsy? I like to be able to think clear, you know? And I don’t want anything that will mess with my blood pressure pill. My daughter always double-checks everything, so she can read the leaflet too, if that’s alright. She’s got a good eye for those things.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, yes, but it's usually mild. And I will ensure there are no interactions with your amlodipine. I'll write a prescription for cyclobenzaprine 5mg, to be taken at bedtime as needed. Please, do have your daughter review the information leaflet. And while we’re waiting for the lab results, try to reduce stress, and ensure adequate hydration. If the headache worsens significantly, or you develop any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Cyclobenzaprine… alright, I can try to remember that name. Stress… well, that’s easier said than done, Doctor. But I'll try. And I'll drink more water, for sure. My daughter's gonna be happy I'm gettin' checked out. She worries about me, always has. Hmm… let me think… No, I think that covers everything. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness. I'll get the blood work done tomorrow morning, and I'll let you know how it goes.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gibbel. You’re welcome. Please contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
