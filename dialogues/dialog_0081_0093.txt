DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, Dr. Paulino. Honestly, it's... well, it's a bit of a mess, isn’t it? Sleep mostly. Been feeling… not quite right when I wake up. Not sick, exactly. Just… not good. And I suppose I should probably be a bit fitter, seeing as… well, never mind. It's all a bit vague, to be honest. I don't really remember when it started, just that it's been going on for a while.
DOCTOR: A “mess,” you say. And not feeling “quite right” upon waking… could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Look, I don’t do details, alright? It’s just… tired. Achy. Like I haven’t properly rested, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. And a bit… sluggish. Like wading through treacle. It’s not painful, just… unpleasant. Honestly, I’m not one for complaining, but it’s getting to the point where it's affecting things. I used to… well, I did things. Now, not so much. And don't ask me what those 'things' were, because frankly, I'm drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Right. “Tired, achy, sluggish.” And this has been ongoing for… how long precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? That's the problem, isn't it? I really can’t put a date on it. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. It's all… blurry. Before… before my wife… everything was different. I was… busier. More focused. Now? Time just sort of… slips by. It's frustrating, really. I’m not usually this… absent-minded. But honestly, trying to recall specifics feels like chasing shadows. Is this… is this something you deal with a lot? People forgetting things? It probably comes with getting older, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: While memory lapses can occur with age, it’s important to determine the cause. Losing focus and general fatigue are… nonspecific symptoms, to say the least. We need to establish a timeline, even an approximate one. You mentioned things were different before your wife… and you experienced a change after that. Can you describe that change?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate you trying to be… thorough. But dwelling on it… it doesn't help. It was… a difficult time, obviously. She was… everything. And after… well, everything just felt… pointless. I stopped caring about things, I suppose. Stopped going out. Stopped… well, stopped doing. The workshop kept me busy, mostly. Repairing instruments. It's… mechanical. Doesn’t require much… thought. The fatigue just sort of crept in after that. It's not like a sudden thing. Just… less energy. Less motivation. I just… existed. Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at… explaining feelings. It’s all very… messy.
DOCTOR: A significant life event followed by a period of decreased activity and subsequent fatigue. Understood. Now, regarding your physical health… do you experience any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… sharp pain, no. Just… aches. Like I said, general achiness. Mostly in my back, I suppose. From bending over instruments all day. Old man stuff. And sometimes my shoulders are a bit stiff. But it’s nothing… debilitating. I’ve always been… resilient. Never one to complain about a little discomfort. It’s just… there. Background noise, really. I’m more concerned about feeling… drained. Like a battery that won’t hold a charge. Is that… is that even a real thing? Being physically tired without actually doing anything strenuous?
DOCTOR: It is, certainly, a real thing. Let's move on to other systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I’m hungry, I suppose. Mostly simple things. Sandwiches. Soup. Don't really have much of a sweet tooth. Weight… possibly? I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. It’s probably… gone down a bit. I’m a tall fella, so I can afford to lose a few pounds. It’s not like I’m wasting away or anything. Don't make too much of it. It's just… things aren't what they used to be, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your sleep?
PATIENT: That’s the whole point, isn’t it? The sleep. It's… fitful. I get to bed at a reasonable hour, I suppose. Around ten, usually. But then I toss and turn. Wake up several times during the night. It's not like I’m thrashing around or anything, just… restless. And then I wake up feeling… not refreshed. Like I haven't slept at all. Sometimes I get up and make a cup of tea. Sit in the workshop for a bit. It’s better than staring at the ceiling. And it's not like I can just… switch it off, you know? My mind just… wanders. Thinking about… things. Things I'd rather not think about.
DOCTOR: Fitful sleep, restlessness, waking unrefreshed. We've covered a fair amount now. Let’s briefly review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – measles, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, climbing a tree. And I had a bad back a few years ago, from lifting something heavy in the workshop, but it healed up fine. Honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor. Never been much of a fan, to be honest. Waste of time, usually. And my wife… she always handled those things. I suppose I should probably pay more attention to it now. But truthfully, it all feels a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not a fan of being cut open, if you don’t mind. I prefer to keep all my original parts, thank you very much. I’ve always been… lucky, I suppose. Good genes. A healthy lifestyle, mostly. Apart from the occasional late night in the workshop, tinkering with instruments. It's not like I live a particularly exciting life. No need for complicated medical procedures.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tricky one. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Died when I was young. And my mother… she had some sort of arthritis, I think. Bad joints. Spent most of her later years in a wheelchair. Apart from that… not really. We weren't a very close family, if you don't mind. Didn't really talk about those things. It's all a bit vague, to be honest. I wouldn’t rely on my memory for specifics. It's probably not relevant, anyway. I'm sure it's just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… well, that’s a sad story. Before… before my wife, we had a good life. Friends, parties, trips to the seaside. But after… after she passed away… I just… withdrew. I don’t really do social things anymore. I spend most of my time in the workshop. It’s… quiet. Peaceful. Easier than being around people. They… remind me of things. Things I’d rather not think about. I have a few… acquaintances, I suppose. People from the village. But I don’t really socialize with them. I prefer my own company, to be honest. It's a lonely life, but it's… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Social withdrawal. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never really had any problems with medications. I don't take much, thankfully. Just the occasional painkiller for my back, if it's really bothering me. And I'm not allergic to anything specific… food, plants, animals… nothing comes to mind. I've always been quite resilient, to be honest. Good constitution. Don't react to much. Is that everything? I feel like I've divulged my entire life story to you. I hope it's… helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That is quite a comprehensive history. Let me just summarize. You’ve been experiencing fatigue, restless sleep, and a general lack of energy for an indefinite period, following the loss of your wife. You’ve withdrawn socially and spend most of your time in your workshop. You report no significant medical history, surgeries, or allergies. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your current condition. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. It's not like I have anything to hide. Just… don't poke too much, alright? I’m not exactly fond of being prodded and poked. And please, be quick about it. I have… things to do. Instruments to repair. Whatever you need. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit shallow. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or organomegaly. Finally, I’ll examine your throat and ears. Throat is clear, ears are normal. Alright. That concludes the physical exam. I’m noting some slightly elevated blood pressure and a fast heart rate, but otherwise, the exam is largely unremarkable.
PATIENT: Remarkable, unremarkable… it all sounds rather… clinical, doesn't it? So, what does it mean? Am I dying or something? Is there something seriously wrong with me? I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? What are your thoughts? Do I need medication? A scan? An exorcist? Just tell me straight. I don't do subtlety.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, you are not dying. And there is no need for an exorcist. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, which could be due to a number of factors, including stress and anxiety. The lack of a definitive finding on the physical exam is, in itself, significant. Given your history of social withdrawal and loss, I suspect a significant component of your symptoms is related to depression and grief. However, to rule out any underlying medical causes, I'd like to order some basic blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. This will help us assess your overall health and identify any potential deficiencies or abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… more poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, it's just one thing after another. Fine. If you think it's necessary. But I'm telling you now, it's probably all in my head. Stress, anxiety, grief… whatever you want to call it. It won’t show up in a blood test. But alright. Do your tests. Just get it over with. And then what? Are you going to prescribe me happy pills? Because frankly, I’m not sure I want them. I prefer to deal with things on my own, thank you very much. Even if it means feeling miserable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand your reluctance. And I assure you, I will not simply prescribe you “happy pills” without a thorough evaluation. The blood work is simply a preliminary step to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Once we have the results, we can discuss your options further. These may include lifestyle modifications, therapy, or, if necessary, medication. But the decision is entirely yours. Here is a requisition form for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. They should be able to take care of you right away. Once the results are back, the lab will fax them to my office. I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to engage in some gentle exercise and getting adequate sleep. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Exercise… sleep… Easy for you to say. It’s not like I have a lot of free time, you know. Instruments don’t repair themselves. But alright. I’ll get the blood work done. Just to get it over with. Don’t expect miracles, though. It won’t change anything. I suppose I’ll see you again then. Whenever the results are back. Try not to bother me until then. And please… don’t mention the “therapy” again. It sounds… dreadful.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Redfern. I will contact you when the results are available. Please take care of yourself. .
