DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising, really. It's been getting worse, and I'm on blood thinners, so… it's a bit worrying. I don't want to waste your time, so I'll just get straight to it.
DOCTOR: Bruising, okay. And you’re already on blood thinners… that is something we need to look into. It’s good you came in. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, I started noticing it maybe a week ago? Small bumps at first, like from just bumping into things – normal stuff. But now… I got one on my arm yesterday just from, like, putting on a sweater. And another one on my leg, I don’t even remember how that happened. They’re bigger now, darker. It's just… a lot more bruising than usual, even for being on the medication.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you said this started about a week ago?
PATIENT: Yep. Exactly a week, I think. August 2nd is today, so around July 26th is when I first noticed it. I remember thinking it was just a bit clumsy that day, but it hasn’t really gotten better. It's just… more.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me what medication you’re currently taking for blood thinning?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It's… Warfarin, I think? Yes, Warfarin. My regular doctor prescribed it a few months back. I can't remember the exact dose, though. Sorry, I'm terrible with names and numbers.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. That's perfectly alright. We can look up the dosage in your records if you’d like. Do you happen to know why you were prescribed Warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes. It was for… atrial fibrillation. That’s what the doctor said. My heart was… fluttering, they said, and it could cause a stroke if I didn't take something. So, Warfarin. It’s been okay, mostly. Just… this bruising is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation, treated with Warfarin. And this increased bruising is a new development. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No bleeding gums or anything like that. No nosebleeds. Just the bruising. And maybe… a little more tired than usual? But I always get tired easily, so I don’t know if that’s related. It's hard to tell. Nothing major, though. Definitely just the bruising.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better look at the bruising and check for anything else. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then I'll take a look at your arms and legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just want to figure out what's going on. I appreciate you taking the time. Let's get it over with, please. I have a few things I need to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll try to be as quick as possible. If you could just have a seat here, and I’ll get started. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. And as I’m looking at the bruising… I see several ecchymoses on both your arms and legs, varying in size from about 2 to 5 centimeters. They appear to be at different stages of healing, some are newer and darker, others are fading. There's mild tenderness to palpation in a few areas, but no significant swelling or warmth. I don’t see any signs of bleeding under the skin at the moment.
PATIENT: That one's a bit sore, yes. But it's not painful, just… uncomfortable. So, what does that mean? Is it something serious? Is it the Warfarin? I just want to know what's happening. I don’t like being in the dark.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking questions. The increased bruising, especially while on Warfarin, is definitely something we need to investigate. It could be related to the medication – the dosage might be a little too high, or there could be an interaction with something else you’re taking. However, it’s also important to rule out other potential causes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your INR level – that’s how we measure how well your blood is clotting – as well as a complete blood count to see if there are any other abnormalities. We'll also want to check your liver function, as that can affect clotting as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. Fine. As long as it gets me an answer. Yes, do the tests. The sooner the better, really. I just… I've got things to do, you know? So, how long will that take? And will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. Depending on what the results show, we may need to adjust your Warfarin dosage or investigate further. It's likely you'll need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and make a plan. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause trauma or injury. And if you experience any unusual bleeding – such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Avoid injury, watch for bleeding, and come back when the results are in. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted. Let's just get the blood drawn, please. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. She'll explain the process to you. It shouldn't take long. Nurse, could you please come in and draw blood for Courtnye Hainley?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, the nurse has just taken your blood. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my staff contact you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – such as significant bleeding, severe pain, or dizziness – please don't hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Emergency room if something bad happens, wait for the call. That's it, right? Just hoping it’s nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll go home and try not to worry.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Courtnye, and try to take it easy. .
