DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it's a bit of a strange thing, really. I just... don't seem to get very hungry anymore. And when I do eat, I fill up awful quick. It's not like I'm enjoying my food less, just... less of it. My wife, Elsie, says I barely touch my plate these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Norval. That’s helpful information. It sounds like you've noticed a decrease in your appetite and experience early satiety – feeling full after only a small amount of food. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good way to put it, “early satiety.” Yes, that's exactly it. When did it start… that's a tough one. I suppose… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn't sudden, more like a slow creep. I just started leaving a bit more on my plate each time, then a bit more, and now… well, now Elsie's worried. I haven't been feeling sick, mind you. Just… not hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over three to four months. And you haven’t experienced any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, not a bit. No sickness, no pain… everything's working, regular as clockwork, if you know what I mean. Elsie checks, you see. She always does. No trouble there, thankfully. It's just this… fullness. It’s like my stomach’s telling me to stop before I’ve had enough.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Norval. And Elsie’s attentiveness is certainly helpful. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss during this time?
PATIENT: Now, that's a fair question. Elsie has been saying I’m looking a bit thinner, but I hadn't really paid it much mind. I'm not one for weighing myself, never have been. But she's usually right about these things. So, yes, I suppose I’ve lost a little weight, but I couldn’t tell you how much. It hasn't been drastic, not like disappearing overnight, but noticeable, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticeable weight loss reported by your wife. That’s important information. Let’s move on to other aspects of your health. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that's about it. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, I think. Always been a strong constitution, my mother used to say. I've never been one for doctors, to be honest. I try to stay active, get outside when I can, eat reasonably well... Well, used to eat well, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of appendectomy, otherwise generally healthy. And you mentioned staying active. Could you describe your typical activity level for me?
PATIENT: Well, I don't run marathons or anything! But I used to be a fisherman, you see. Spent a lot of time on the water, hauling nets, that sort of thing. Retired now, of course. Still walk most days, though. Down to the store for Elsie's groceries, around the village a bit… Nothing strenuous, but I keep moving. And I still help out with some of the cultural events, carving a little, things like that. It keeps my hands busy, and my mind too.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good level of activity, Norval. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a one. Never been much for pills. Elsie gives me a multivitamin now and then, says it’s good for an old man, but that's about it. I don't take anything regularly. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, if I need it. And a bit of liniment for my knees, when the weather gets damp.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Nope. Not to food, not to plants, not to anything as far as I know. Elsie asks every time I go to a new doctor, and I always say the same thing. Never had a reaction to anything. Lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a bit tricky. My mother lived to a good old age, but she didn't talk much about family history. My father passed when I was young, so I don't know much about his side. There was an uncle, Elsie's father, who had something with his heart, I think. But other than that… not that I know of. We weren’t a family that went to doctors much. A bit of a stoic bunch, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for families to not have detailed medical histories. Now, just a few questions about your social habits. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. Elsie's father smoked, and it wasn't a pretty sight. Put me off it for good, that did. Always thought it was a foolish habit.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner now and then, Doctor. Nothing heavy. Elsie and I both enjoy a little something with our meal. It helps us relax, you see. But it’s not every night, and it’s never more than one glass each. We're not big drinkers.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's helpful. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing that we haven't discussed yet?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, I suppose not. Just this… lack of appetite and the fullness. It’s not painful or anything, just… bothersome. I worry a bit, that's all. Elsie worries more, to be honest. She's a good woman, always looking out for me. And I suppose it’s just as well to get it checked out, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: I agree, Norval, it’s always best to investigate. Alright, I’d like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Just tell me if anything feels… peculiar. I'm not one for fancy medical things, but I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I’ll also check your reflexes and assess your overall well-being. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright. Just tell me if anything feels off. It's a bit chilly on my skin, isn't it? This room could use a bit of warming up, Elsie always says I feel the cold more as I get older. But go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to relax.
DOCTOR: I am noticing some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, specifically in the epigastric region. It's not sharp pain, but you are definitely tensing up when I press there. The rest of your abdomen feels soft, without any masses or significant tenderness. Alright, Norval. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Overall, you seem to be in stable condition, but the tenderness in your upper abdomen is something we need to investigate further. Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, there are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be something as simple as gastritis or indigestion, but we also need to rule out other conditions.
PATIENT: Gastritis, you say? That sounds… unpleasant. Elsie makes a lovely ginger tea, she always says it settles my stomach, but it hasn’t been helping much lately. What other conditions might it be, Doctor? I don’t want to worry Elsie unnecessarily. She gets anxious enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about Elsie, Norval. It’s good she has such a caring nature, and we want to address this carefully. Gastritis, as you mentioned, is an inflammation of the stomach lining. It can cause discomfort and early satiety. Other possibilities, though less likely given your age and medical history, include a peptic ulcer, or, more rarely, something like pancreatic insufficiency. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help assess your overall health, check for signs of inflammation, and rule out any underlying conditions. I would also like to order a stool test to assess for digestive issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a stool test? Oh dear. Elsie will be having a field day with that one. But yes, Doctor, if it's necessary, go ahead. I trust your judgement. It's just… a bit undignified, isn't it? But if it helps figure out what’s going on, then so be it. When do I need to get these done? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Norval. These tests aren’t the most pleasant, but they’re important for accurate diagnosis. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. This means no food or drinks, except for water. We can schedule the blood tests and stool collection for tomorrow morning. The lab is just down the street, and it shouldn’t take long. I’m sending a requisition to the lab now. Once the results are back – which usually takes a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat small, frequent meals, and avoiding any foods that seem to aggravate your symptoms. And please, don't hesitate to contact me if you experience any worsening of your condition. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Small, frequent meals… Elsie will be pleased to hear that. She’s always telling me to eat more regularly. Right, eight hours fasting, got it. I think that covers everything, Doctor. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. Just… thank you. It’s reassuring to know someone is looking into this. Elsie will be relieved. And I’ll try to remember to avoid anything that makes it worse. Perhaps no more of her rhubarb crumble for a bit… though that’s a sacrifice, to be sure.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease, even a little. And perhaps a temporary break from the rhubarb crumble is a wise decision. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, you’ll be back to enjoying your meals – and Elsie’s baking – in no time. Here are the requisitions for your blood tests and stool collection. The lab staff will provide you with detailed instructions. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today, Norval. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. And please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I will. And I’ll see you soon.
