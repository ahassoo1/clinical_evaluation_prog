DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Sham. Well, to be frank, my wife insisted. She's a bit...overly cautious, you know? But I wanted to get tested for, uh, that HIV thing. Just to keep the peace, really. Though I can't see why I would need to be tested. I'm a pretty careful guy.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, it's always good to be proactive, even if you feel it's unlikely. And your wife’s concern is understandable. Just to be clear, you're requesting an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. An HIV test. Though honestly, I think it’s a bit of a waste of everyone’s time. But she’s been on about it for weeks, so here I am. Is it going to take long? I have a lot on my plate, you know, making sure everyone else is doing things properly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a relatively quick process. Before we proceed, though, I need to ask a few questions. It's standard procedure, and helps me understand your risk factors. It’s important for accurate testing and, frankly, for proper counseling should the result be positive. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Really? What does that have to do with anything? Look, I work in compliance, I follow rules. I don’t have a lifestyle that needs…assessing. But fine, ask. Just don't expect interesting answers. I’m a pretty straightforward guy. And I'm married, if that's what you're getting at. Very happily, I might add.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's not about implying anything, Mr. Belan. It’s just part of the risk assessment. Let’s start with this: Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Absolutely not. That's…a rather personal question, don't you think? I've already told you, I'm a married man. A respectable married man. Why are you even asking about that? It's almost insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the question seemed insensitive, Mr. Belan. It’s standard protocol, and helps us ensure accurate testing. Sometimes, STIs can go undetected. Now, have you ever shared needles with anyone, even for non-medical reasons?
PATIENT: Needles? Are you serious right now? I work in an office. I manage paperwork. I do not…share needles. That's ridiculous. I’m starting to think this whole thing is a bit of a joke. Is this some sort of training exercise for you? Because frankly, you're wasting my time. And, I repeat, my wife is going to be furious if I'm here much longer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Let’s move on then. Have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Years ago. When I was… younger. I was in a car accident. It wasn't a big deal, a bit of a fender bender, but I lost some blood. It was in Kathmandu, though. The healthcare wasn't exactly…top-notch. I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago. Why is all this relevant? Is there something you're not telling me?
DOCTOR: The reason this is relevant, Mr. Belan, is that before widespread screening, there was a risk of contracting certain infections through blood transfusions. And given that the transfusion took place in Kathmandu, where screening protocols may have differed, it's important to consider. Do you recall approximately when this transfusion occurred?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it must have been… around 2010, maybe 2011? It was before we got married, definitely. I was still…finding my feet, professionally. It wasn't a fancy hospital, more of a clinic, really. And it was a bit chaotic. Lots of people. I don't remember the exact date, I wasn't exactly keeping a diary of medical procedures. But it was over a decade ago, for sure. Honestly, this is getting rather tedious. Can we just get on with the test? I have reports to finalize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the timeframe and location of the transfusion, we should proceed with the testing. We'll do a standard blood test. It's confidential, of course. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any risky behaviors that could potentially expose you to infection. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Risky behaviors? Really? I just told you, I'm a married man in compliance! What sort of establishment do you think this is? Latex… no, I don't think so. My wife buys the gloves for the house, I haven't paid much attention. Look, I'm trusting you’re a professional, but this line of questioning is becoming increasingly…unnecessary. Just do the test. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with the blood draw then. Nurse Patel will be in shortly to take a sample. She'll explain the procedure. It's a standard venipuncture – a simple blood draw from your arm. Afterwards, avoid strenuous activity for a few minutes. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. Just…get it over with. And please, tell Nurse Patel to be quick. I have deadlines, you know. This is a complete waste of my valuable time. Honestly, my wife is going to hear about this. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I'll let Nurse Patel know you're ready. .
