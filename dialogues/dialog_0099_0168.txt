DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit… delicate, really. I’m dating someone new, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is… as it should be. One doesn't want unpleasant surprises, you understand. It’s important to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Thoroughness is… admirable. Let's be direct then. You're concerned about sexually transmitted infections, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you put it so… bluntly. Yes, that is precisely it. Though, it’s not just that, you see. It's about overall health, ensuring he’s… a suitable partner, health-wise. One has standards, Doctor. And frankly, I wouldn’t trust him to have done this on his own. A professional opinion is vital.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly run some tests to give you peace of mind. Let’s start with a basic history. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: A recent one? Hmm. Well, the Medicare annual wellness visit, of course. But a thorough one? Not in… oh, perhaps two years ago? It was with Dr. Hemlock, before he retired. He was… adequate. Though I doubt he would have considered this level of detail.
DOCTOR: Two years ago with Dr. Hemlock. Adequate is… noted. Alright. And have you had any symptoms – anything at all – that prompted you to come in today specifically?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. That’s why I said it was preventative. I don't feel unwell, Doctor. I simply prefer to be proactive. One doesn't wait for a problem to manifest before addressing it. It’s… irresponsible, really. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes I feel… a little more tired than usual. But that could be anything, I suppose. This heat, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Fatigue… noted. And when did you start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s difficult to say precisely. Perhaps… the last month or so? It comes and goes, really. Not debilitating, just… a general lack of energy. I've been blaming it on my book club, honestly. We're reading a rather dense novel at the moment, and it's quite mentally taxing. But one must be sure, mustn't one? It wouldn't do to have something else going on.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you sexually active with this new partner?
PATIENT: Well, naturally. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? Though, I assure you, it’s… discreet. And I’ve insisted on protection, of course. But one can never be too careful, Doctor. Especially with… certain types of people. I wouldn’t want to burden you with details, but let’s just say his background isn't… entirely transparent.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're using protection, but concerned about potential exposures given his… background. We'll proceed as though there's a risk. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Thankfully, my health has always been quite robust. I do have a touch of seasonal allergies, and my knees bother me in cold weather, but nothing serious. My mother lived to be ninety-seven, so I suspect I’ve inherited good genes. Though, one can’t rely on heredity alone, can one? That’s why I’m here. To be certain.
DOCTOR: No chronic conditions, seasonal allergies, knees bother her in cold weather. Good genes… noted. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes, I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course. And a rather unpleasant bunion surgery on my left foot about ten years ago. It was… a difficult recovery. But thankfully, it healed well. Nothing else, no. I’ve always been rather averse to hospitals and… procedures. That’s why I prefer preventative measures. Avoid the need, you see?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, bunion surgery ten years ago. Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a complicated matter, Doctor. My mother’s side… well, there was a great deal of… secrecy. I know my grandfather had “nervous troubles,” as they called it then, and my aunt had something with her heart, but details were always… scarce. My father's side was more straightforward. He had high blood pressure, as did his father. But overall, I believe my lineage is… reasonably sound. Though, one never truly knows, does one?
DOCTOR: "Nervous troubles" and high blood pressure… noted. And what about your social history, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, goodness. Well, I’m married, as you can see from my chart. My husband, Reginald, is a retired accountant. We live a quiet life. I'm active in my book club, and I volunteer at the local library. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink—a glass of sherry with dinner on special occasions. Honestly, Doctor, my life is rather… unremarkable. And that’s precisely how I prefer it. Though, this… dating situation is certainly a deviation from the norm.
DOCTOR: Married, husband retired accountant, book club, volunteering, no smoking, rare alcohol use. Deviation from the norm… noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a daily multivitamin, and occasionally some ibuprofen for my knees when the weather is particularly damp. Nothing serious, Doctor. I pride myself on maintaining a natural lifestyle. I believe in nourishing the body with wholesome foods and… a positive attitude. Though, I suppose even the most diligent individual can benefit from a little support, can’t they? That’s why I’m here, after all. To ensure everything is… optimal.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen. Alright. Now, Ms. Pandolfi, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Thankfully, my constitution is quite strong. I've never had a reaction to anything. Though, I do get a slight rash from certain brands of laundry detergent, but that’s hardly a medical concern, is it? I believe in using gentle, natural products whenever possible. And I always, always read the labels. One must be cautious, you understand. Especially with… everything that’s in the market these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a physical exam. I'd like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. Then, given your concerns, I'll need to collect some urine and blood samples for testing. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of needles. Is there any way to… minimize the discomfort? And, of course, I expect complete discretion. I wouldn’t want this information… circulating. One has a reputation to maintain, you understand. Proceed as you deem necessary, but please be gentle.
DOCTOR: I assure you, everything will be handled with the utmost professionalism and discretion. We'll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Nothing significant, but we'll make a note of it. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities detected. Now, we will need a urine sample and some blood work. The nurse will assist you with that.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A murmur, you say? Is that… serious, Doctor? I do have a tendency to worry, you see. And I trust your professional judgment, of course, but a little explanation would be… reassuring. The nurse, you say? I hope she’s… discreet. Proceed as necessary. I’ll… try to remain calm.
DOCTOR: The murmur is mild, Ms. Pandolfi. It's likely benign, but we’ll run some tests to confirm. It's standard procedure. As for the nurse, she’s been with the clinic for years and is completely trustworthy. She’ll explain the blood work process. Now, let's get those samples collected. The results will take a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are available. Do you have any questions before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Though… the tests, will they reveal… everything? All potential… issues? One doesn’t want any surprises, you understand. It's best to be prepared, even if the news is… unfavorable. And will the results be confidential? I trust you implicitly, Doctor, but one must be cautious in these matters. Proceed as you see fit. I’ll… attempt to remain optimistic.
DOCTOR: The tests will provide a comprehensive overview of your health, Ms. Pandolfi. We'll be checking for common STIs, assessing your organ function, and looking for any signs of inflammation or infection. However, no test is 100% definitive. And yes, your results will be kept strictly confidential, in accordance with all applicable privacy regulations. Now, let's focus on getting these samples collected. The more information we have, the better equipped we'll be to address any concerns.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose one has no other choice. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Please inform me of every step of the process. I prefer to be… fully informed. And do ensure the nurse is… gentle. Proceed as you see fit.
