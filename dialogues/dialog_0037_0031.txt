DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, my left leg has been quite swollen lately, and… I have a heart thing, you see. The doctor told me it’s called… atrial… fibrillation? Something like that. It’s the reason for the swelling, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, thank you for sharing that. So, the primary concern is the swelling in your left leg, and you suspect it’s related to a condition called atrial fibrillation. Just to clarify, has a doctor diagnosed you with atrial fibrillation, or are you thinking it might be that based on something you’ve read or been told?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a doctor did diagnose it. A few years ago, now. I've had check-ups for it since. It’s just… I haven’t been to a doctor in a bit, and the leg swelling is new. It’s gotten worse over the last couple of weeks, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s helpful to know it’s a confirmed diagnosis. And you said the swelling has been worsening over the past couple of weeks. Can you describe the swelling to me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly in my calf, I think. My whole leg isn’t puffed up, just the lower part. It feels… tight, and a bit achy, if I’ve been on my feet too long. It’s not terribly painful, more… uncomfortable. It’s definitely bigger than usual, though. I noticed it when my trousers felt a bit snug.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily in the calf, tight and achy with prolonged standing, and you noticed it because your trousers felt tighter. Has this swelling come and gone before, or is this a continuous new development?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think it’s ever been this bad before. I’ve had some… puffiness in my ankles sometimes, but it usually went down if I put my feet up. This has been pretty constant for the last two weeks, even with resting. It doesn't seem to be going away on its own, which is why I decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a new level of swelling, persistent for two weeks, and not responding to rest as it has in the past. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the swollen area?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t feel warm to the touch, and I haven’t seen any redness. It just looks… bigger. A bit paler, maybe, than my other leg, but that might just be how the light is. I haven’t noticed any pain if I press on it, either. Just the achiness I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness, warmth, or pain with palpation, just achiness. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations recently?
PATIENT: Oh… palpitations, yes. That’s part of the… heart thing. It comes and goes. I get a fluttering feeling in my chest sometimes, especially if I’ve had too much coffee. It hasn’t been too bad lately, though. No chest pain, and I don’t think I’ve been short of breath. Maybe a little… winded if I climb a lot of stairs, but that’s just getting old, I expect.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you experience palpitations related to your atrial fibrillation, but no recent changes in that, no chest pain, and only mild shortness of breath with exertion. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Aside from the atrial fibrillation, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. The atrial fibrillation was the biggest thing, and that was a few years ago. I’ve not been in hospital for anything, thankfully. I do have… well, I don’t have insurance, if that’s important. That’s why I haven’t been to the doctor as often as I probably should.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important information, thank you for letting me know. And it's good to hear you haven't had any other major medical issues. Okay, and have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid all of that. Both my parents needed hip replacements when they got older, but I've managed to keep all my original parts, so far!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Nixon. Now, let's briefly touch on your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, blood clots, or anything else that comes to mind?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something with her legs… she had to have bandages on them for a long time. I don’t know what it was, exactly. Not heart trouble, though. Just… bad legs, I suppose. My mother always said it was hereditary. I can’t recall anything else, honestly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension in your father and a leg condition in your grandmother, though the specifics are unclear. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I enjoy a cup of tea with my dinner sometimes, but that's about it. And definitely no drugs. I’m a computer science teacher, you see. I spend most of my evenings marking papers and trying to keep up with the latest technology!
DOCTOR: That’s admirable, keeping up with technology these days. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one. I take… Warfarin, I think it’s called. That’s for the atrial fibrillation. It’s to thin the blood, the doctor explained. I’ve been on it for years, and I try to be very careful to take it at the same time every evening. It's important, apparently. I do have my blood tested regularly to make sure the dosage is right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, thank you for that comprehensive information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I’ll take a look at your leg and compare it to your other leg. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at it properly. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is 138/82, heart rate is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. Okay, I’m noting some mild edema – swelling – in your left calf compared to your right. The skin feels warm to the touch, but there’s no redness. I’m also checking the pulses in your feet. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Capillary refill is less than three seconds in both feet. There's slight tenderness to palpation over the calf muscle, but no sharp pain. Based on this initial exam, it appears you have some swelling and tenderness in your left calf, consistent with edema. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and Warfarin use, and the fact that this is a new development, we need to consider a few possibilities. One concern is deep vein thrombosis, or DVT – a blood clot in a deep vein. However, the lack of significant pain, redness, or warmth makes that less likely. We also need to consider other causes of leg swelling, such as muscle strain or lymphatic congestion.
PATIENT: Oh… a blood clot? That sounds… serious. I thought Warfarin was meant to prevent those. So, what do we do now? Do you need to take some blood? Or… do a scan of my leg? I'm not keen on scans if they aren't necessary, honestly.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Nixon, and you're also right, Warfarin is meant to prevent blood clots. However, it doesn’t guarantee complete protection, and it’s important to rule out a DVT given your symptoms and medical history. A scan is likely necessary, unfortunately. The best imaging test for a suspected DVT is a Doppler ultrasound. It’s non-invasive, uses sound waves, and doesn’t involve radiation. It's the most accurate way to visualize the veins in your leg and check for any clots. Before we order that, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test. It’s a simple blood test that can help us determine if there's evidence of a blood clot forming. If the D-dimer is elevated, it increases the likelihood of a DVT and supports the need for the ultrasound. If it's normal, it makes a DVT less likely, but doesn't rule it out completely. Would you be comfortable with a D-dimer blood test, to start?
PATIENT: A D-dimer test… yes, that sounds sensible. Much less scary than a scan, anyway. If that’s alright, then please do. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It’s my job. Alright, I’ll get the order in to the lab now. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes to get the results back. While we’re waiting, I’d like you to elevate your left leg on a pillow and avoid prolonged standing or walking. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had any problems with anything like that. And I will certainly keep my leg up. Thank you for reminding me. It's good to have a bit of direction, you see.
DOCTOR: Good. And just to reiterate, if you experience any sudden, sharp pain in your calf, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. While we wait for the results, let's discuss your Warfarin. Are you having any difficulties taking it regularly, or are you experiencing any side effects, such as easy bruising or bleeding?
PATIENT: No difficulties taking it, thankfully. I’m very careful with it. And… well, I do bruise a bit easier than I used to, but I just put that down to getting older! Nothing serious, just the odd bump when I knock into things. I haven’t had any bleeding at all. Mostly just a bit clumsy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Easy bruising can be a side effect of Warfarin, so it's good you're aware of it. We’ll keep an eye on that. Ah, excellent. The lab results are back. Your D-dimer level is elevated. While it doesn’t definitively diagnose a DVT, it’s concerning enough to warrant further investigation. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. Would you like me to schedule that for you now, or would you prefer to do it elsewhere?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? Well, if you think it’s best, then yes, please schedule the ultrasound. It’s probably easier if it’s done here. I suppose the sooner we know, the better. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I agree, the sooner we have a clear answer, the better. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for a Doppler ultrasound in the imaging department in one hour. They're located just down the hall. The technician will likely ask you some questions about your medical history and symptoms. The exam itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, continue to elevate your leg and avoid prolonged standing. I’ll review the ultrasound results as soon as they're available and discuss the findings with you. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: One hour… alright. No, I don’t think I do, actually. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly. I suppose I’m just a bit… anxious, now. But I trust you’re doing everything you can. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go and sit quietly for a bit, then. And keep my leg up!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Nixon. I'm here to help, and we'll take things one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to let the staff know if you need anything at all while you're waiting. I'll check on you after the ultrasound. Alright. Please take care, and I'll see you shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
