DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. After the cancer, you know? It’s in my leg. It’s just… puffy. And a little uncomfortable. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I understand. Swelling in the leg after cancer treatment is something we definitely want to investigate. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a month ago? After I finished all the… the treatments. It wasn’t much at first, just a little bigger than usual. But it’s gotten bigger since then. I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. Old legs, you know? But now… it bothers me when I walk.
DOCTOR: I understand. A month ago, following the completion of your cancer treatment, and it's gradually increased in size, now causing discomfort with ambulation. That's helpful information. To clarify, when you say “bigger than usual,” had you experienced any swelling in that leg before the cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never before the treatments. It was fine. Perfectly fine! I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but no swelling. This is new. Completely new. I’m… worried it’s something bad. Is it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Queener. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried when something new develops. We’ll certainly do our best to figure out what’s going on. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the location of the swelling more precisely?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s on my right leg. Mostly in the calf. The lower part, you know? Not the knee, not the ankle… right in the middle of the calf. It’s hard to explain. It feels… all puffy there. And a little warm sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Right leg, calf region, primarily, with some warmth noted at times. We'll need to examine it to get a more accurate assessment. Before we do that, have you noticed any changes in the skin color or texture in that area?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The skin… it looks the same, I think. Maybe a little red sometimes, but that could just be from walking. It doesn't feel different, not really. No bumps, no… I don’t know… nothing like that. Just puffy. And a little uncomfortable. I hope it’s not serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Queener. No noticeable changes in skin color or texture beyond possible redness associated with ambulation. Now, have you experienced any pain associated with this swelling?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More like… a heavy feeling. And a dull ache if I stand for too long. It doesn't hurt to touch it, not really. It's just… annoying. And it makes my shoe feel tight. That’s probably the worst of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. A heavy sensation and a dull ache with prolonged standing, no significant pain to the touch, and some discomfort due to shoe tightness. Before we proceed with the examination, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I had the cancer, of course. Breast cancer. They… took some things out, and I had the… the radiation. And the pills. I take pills every day. Aside from that… not much. I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s under control now. And my arthritis, but that’s just… old age. Is that enough? I don’t remember much else.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Queener. Breast cancer treatment with surgery, radiation, and ongoing oral medication, a history of hypertension now well-controlled, and arthritis. Could you please tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have the little bag right here. rummages in handbag Okay, there’s Tamoxifen… that’s the pink one. And Lisinopril… for the blood pressure. And… oh, and Ibuprofen sometimes, for the arthritis. That's it, I think. Unless… oh, a vitamin D pill. My doctor said I needed that. Small white one. Does that matter? I try to remember, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful. Tamoxifen, Lisinopril, Ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, except for the ones the doctor gives me! chuckles lightly No, seriously, I don't have any allergies. I'm lucky that way. Is that good? Should I be allergic to something? I worry about everything, you know.
DOCTOR: That is good, Ms. Queener. No known allergies. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on with your leg, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. This swelling… it worries me. Please, go ahead. Let's get it over with. I have a lunch date, you know. A small one. But still.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I understand your concern, and I’ll be as efficient as possible. Now, if you could please sit comfortably on the examination table, I’ll start by examining your leg. First, I’m going to palpate the area of swelling to assess its consistency and tenderness. Then, I’ll check the pulses in your foot and ankle, and compare the temperature of both legs. Finally, I'll look for any signs of skin breakdown or discoloration. Okay, the swelling is present primarily in the lower calf, it feels somewhat firm and there is mild tenderness to palpation. The pulses are present and equal bilaterally, and there's no significant temperature difference between your legs. There's no obvious skin breakdown or discoloration. Now, I'd like to measure the circumference of both calves to quantify the swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Measure away. I hope it’s not too bad. It feels bigger, you know? Just… bigger. Do you think it’s the cancer? Has it come back? Oh dear. Please just tell me what’s going on. I just want to know. Measuring is fine, though. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Queener. We will work through this step-by-step. Your right calf measures 38 centimeters, and your left calf measures 35 centimeters. That indicates a 3-centimeter difference in circumference. Given your history of breast cancer and the recent swelling in your leg, it’s important to consider several possibilities. One potential cause is lymphedema, which is swelling that can occur after cancer treatment due to damage to the lymphatic system. Another possibility is a deep vein thrombosis , a blood clot in a deep vein, which can also cause swelling and pain. While less likely given the lack of significant pain, we cannot rule it out without further investigation. To help us determine the cause of the swelling, I’d like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your veins and arteries. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot? That sounds… bad. Lymphedema… I think I read about that. Is it serious? A test… okay, if you think it’s necessary. Ultrasound… no pain, you said? Just… looking? Okay. Yes, do the test. I just want to know what’s going on. As soon as possible, if you can. I really don’t want a blood clot. That’s… scary. Can you explain it to me? What will it show? And how long will it take? I need to get to my lunch date, you know. A small one. But still.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Queener. A DVT can be serious, but it’s important to remember that we are only considering it as a possibility at this point. The ultrasound will help us determine if a clot is present. The ultrasound uses a handheld device that emits sound waves. It’s completely painless, and it doesn't involve any radiation. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and move the device across your skin. The sound waves will create an image of the veins and arteries, allowing us to see if there are any blood clots present. The test typically takes about 30 to 45 minutes to complete. Once the results are available, I will review them with you and discuss the appropriate course of action. While we wait for the ultrasound results, I also recommend elevating your right leg whenever possible, and wearing compression stockings to help reduce the swelling. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound or the other recommendations?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… I think I have some somewhere. Old ones, maybe. Elevation… yes, I can do that. My chair is quite comfy. Thirty to forty-five minutes… okay. That's not too bad. Will it show… everything? Will it show if the cancer has come back? Or if it’s something else completely? I just… I worry, you know? I’ve had so much treatment already. And… will I need more treatment if it is a blood clot? Or… something worse? Please, Doctor, just tell me what to expect. I need to know. I really, really need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Queener. It's perfectly natural to be worried. The ultrasound will primarily focus on assessing the blood flow in your leg to identify any signs of a DVT. It will not directly show if the cancer has returned, but if we find anything unusual, we may need to order further imaging, such as an MRI or CT scan, to investigate further. If the ultrasound reveals a DVT, treatment typically involves the use of blood-thinning medications, also known as anticoagulants, to prevent the clot from growing and to reduce the risk of complications, such as a pulmonary embolism. The duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the clot and your overall health. If the ultrasound is negative for a DVT, we will explore other potential causes of the swelling, such as lymphedema, venous insufficiency, or a musculoskeletal issue. I want to assure you that we will work through this step-by-step, and I will keep you informed every step of the way. We’ll address any concerns you have and make the best decisions together. Now, while we wait for the ultrasound results, I’m going to write a referral for the test and provide you with instructions on how to prepare. We will schedule the ultrasound for as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. It’s still… worrying, of course. But I feel a little better knowing what to expect. Just… please hurry with the test. And please let me know as soon as you have the results. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for not laughing at me when I worry. Old people worry, you know. It’s what we do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. I assure you, your concerns are perfectly valid, and I’m here to help in any way I can. And please, don't worry about worrying - it's perfectly natural, and I’m happy to address any questions or concerns you have, no matter how small. I’ll get the referral for the ultrasound processed right away and arrange for you to have the test as soon as possible. I will personally contact you as soon as the results are available to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, please remember to elevate your leg whenever possible, and wear compression stockings if you have them. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased pain, redness, or swelling, or if you develop a fever or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Queener. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
