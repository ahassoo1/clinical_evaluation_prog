DOCTOR: Right. Stephane Nissenbaum, 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day, Doctor… Osga, is it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear. And half my face feels… droopy. It’s quite alarming, really. I hope you can figure it out quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. “Quickly” is…ambitious. But we’ll try. One ear, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, just the left one. It happened overnight, I didn't bang my head or anything. And like I said, the left side of my face… it just feels weak. It’s hard to explain, but it’s definitely not right. I noticed it when I was brushing my teeth. Are you going to look at it, or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: I am looking at you. And asking questions helps me determine what to look for. But fine. Let’s have a look. Please sit still. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It feels… strange. Like half my face isn't listening to the other half. Honestly, I’ve never experienced anything like it. Is it a stroke? Because I read something about that… and time is of the essence, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some asymmetry on the left side. It’s subtle, but it’s there. And you’re right to be concerned about a stroke. We need to rule that out. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No dizziness. No headache. My vision is fine, as far as I can tell. I haven't felt weak anywhere else. Just this… facial thing and the hearing loss. And frankly, the inconvenience of it all! I have things to do, you know. This isn't how I planned my Saturday. Are you going to need to send me for a scan or something? I really don't have time for a lengthy investigation.
DOCTOR: Right, no headache, no weakness… good. The hearing loss is concerning, especially with the facial weakness. It could be a stroke, or something else, but we need to be thorough. I'm going to order a stat CT scan of your head, just to rule things out. And I’m going to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any history of high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Honestly, Doctor, do I look like someone with high blood pressure? I eat reasonably well, I don't smoke, and I’m quite active for my age. No, no history of either, thank you very much. And really, a scan? Couldn't you just give me something for it? A steroid, perhaps? I’ve heard those can help with… inflammation. This whole process is rather inefficient, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: No, I can't just "give you something for it." We need to know what we're treating. And a scan is the fastest way to do that. I'm sending the order to radiology now. It'll be a few minutes. In the meantime, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking anything, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I pride myself on being healthy. I take a multivitamin, if that counts. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Really, Doctor, are you questioning my lifestyle choices? This is getting ridiculous. Just get the scan done, and tell me what's wrong. I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: Right. No regular medications. Multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen noted. And yes, I'm trying to gather information. It's what doctors do. Look, the scan is ordered. While we wait, I'm going to check your blood pressure, just to be sure. It’s a standard procedure. And then we'll see what the scan shows. Please relax.
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you must. But I assure you, it will be perfectly normal. I told you, I’m a healthy woman. This is just a waste of time, really. And don’t tell me to “relax.” It’s incredibly condescending. Just hurry up. My date is with rather important people.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95. Several times. Hmm. That is elevated. Significantly. See, this is why I ask questions and do a proper examination. It’s not just about listening to your self-assessment. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension before?
PATIENT: Hypertension? Oh… well, my late husband’s doctor mentioned something once, about my numbers being a little high during a check-up. But he didn’t say anything serious! I just… didn’t bother following up. It’s probably just stress, from… everything. It doesn't mean anything. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It’s just a little deafness and a bit of facial drooping. Don’t tell me I need medication now.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Nissenbaum. The facial weakness and the elevated blood pressure are concerning. And yes, it very well could be a stroke, or something related to uncontrolled hypertension. We need to get this scan done, and then we'll discuss a plan. It’s not about making a mountain out of a molehill; it’s about your health. .
