DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I scheduled this appointment to discuss… planning for the future, if you will. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… should something happen. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and the details are… hazy. I think it has something to do with forms? An Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this. Planning for the future, as you say, is incredibly important, and it's common for details to feel a bit overwhelming. You're right, it sounds like you're interested in Advance Care Planning. That includes documents like an Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – and a POLST form, which stands for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. To start, perhaps we can clarify what each of those forms entails, and then we can decide which might be the most appropriate for you at this time?
PATIENT: That would be… most helpful, Doctor. Honestly, the terms all sound rather… serious. And a bit frightening, if I’m being frank. I confess, I don’t really understand the difference between them. I just want to be certain… that my preferences are respected, should I be unable to communicate them myself. Could you explain it in… simpler terms, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. It is a bit daunting, and you’re right to feel that way. Let's break it down. Think of an Advance Directive as a broader document. It outlines your overall wishes for your medical care if you become seriously ill and unable to make decisions. It can cover things like what kind of treatments you want, or don't want, and who you want to make decisions for you. It’s generally used when you are facing a medical situation that isn’t immediately upon us. A POLST form, on the other hand, is a more specific medical order. It's for people with a serious illness or frailty, and it tells healthcare professionals what treatments you currently want or don't want – things like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. It’s a form that travels with you, so emergency responders or doctors in any setting know your wishes. Does that distinction make a little more sense?
PATIENT: …So, the Advance Directive is… a more general plan for the future, a statement of overall preferences. And the POLST form is… a more immediate set of instructions, for current medical needs. Is that correct? It is starting to become a little clearer, thank you. I suppose… given my age, and… well, I don’t have any specific serious illness at the moment, perhaps the Advance Directive would be the more appropriate starting point? Though I’m still unsure about the details… what sort of things does it typically cover?
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s a perfect way to put it. And yes, given your current health status, an Advance Directive would be a very sensible place to start. Typically, it covers a range of potential scenarios. It allows you to specify what types of medical treatments you would or would not want if you were seriously ill or unable to communicate. This could include things like: Life-sustaining treatment: Such as mechanical ventilation , CPR, or dialysis. Pain management: Your preferences for how your pain should be treated. Artificial nutrition and hydration: Whether you want to receive food and fluids through a feeding tube. Designation of a healthcare proxy: This is the person you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It's a fairly comprehensive document, but we can tailor it to your specific wishes and values. We don't need to cover everything if you're not comfortable. Would you like me to show you a sample form so you can get a better idea of the types of questions it asks?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather extensive, Doctor. And honestly, the thought of making decisions about all of those things… it’s a little overwhelming. Especially given my… unreliable memory. I worry I’ll forget what I’ve decided, or change my mind later. Perhaps seeing a sample form would be helpful, just to gauge the scope of it all. But… I confess, I’m not sure I’m prepared to fill it out today. Would it be possible to take it home and… consider it at my own pace? And perhaps return at a later date to discuss it with you?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s perfectly reasonable. It is a lot to think about, and there’s no rush whatsoever. Taking it home and considering it at your own pace is an excellent idea. We can absolutely review it together at a later date. I have several copies here. Before I give you the form, just so I have a complete picture, are there any specific concerns or worries you have about your medical care that you’d like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Well… It’s not a specific concern, exactly. But… I’ve always valued my independence. The idea of being… a burden on others, of requiring constant care… it’s rather frightening. And I suppose that’s why I want to make these decisions now, while I’m still able to. But it’s difficult to articulate, and I fear I'm not being very clear. Perhaps this form will help me to focus my thoughts. If you don't mind, I think I would like to take it home and review it. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're being very clear, Ms. Buoniconti. Your desire to maintain your independence is completely understandable, and a very valid concern to address. That’s a wonderful reason to be thinking about this now, and we will certainly factor that into our discussion. Here is a copy of the Advance Directive form. Take your time with it, and don't hesitate to write down any questions or concerns that come to mind. I'm happy to schedule a follow-up appointment when you're ready to discuss it further. Would next week work for you?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that is very kind of you. Next week would be… acceptable, yes. Perhaps sometime in the afternoon? I tend to be more… focused then. And if I’m being perfectly honest, my memory is somewhat… less reliable in the mornings. It seems I’m becoming increasingly aware of my limitations. Thank you again for your patience, Doctor. I believe that’s all for today. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. We all have our best times for certain tasks, and it’s good to be aware of those. I’ve scheduled you for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and take care.
