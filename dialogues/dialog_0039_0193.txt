DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Kamahele. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. I have a lot of it. More than usual, you understand? It is… bothersome, yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “A lot of gas,” you say. And it's been more than usual recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Perhaps… two weeks now? It started slowly, a little rumble after meals. But now… it is quite frequent. And sometimes… rather loud, if I am being honest. It does not hurt, thankfully, just… embarrassing. I eat mostly simple foods, you know? Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks of increased gas, started gradually and is now more frequent. No pain, just… socially inconvenient, shall we say?
PATIENT: Yes, “socially inconvenient” is a very polite way to put it, Doctor. Exactly. I… I work at the burger place, you see? And well, you can imagine. It is not a good look, no. Mostly I just eat the burgers and fries, what we have there. Sometimes a little salad. But mostly burgers.
DOCTOR: I see. Working at a burger place… that could certainly contribute. And you said mostly burgers and fries?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is what I eat during my shift. And… sometimes I have a burger when I get home too. I do not drink much soda, mostly water. I do try to drink the water. But the burgers… they are… good. And easy. Is this… bad? I am not very good at knowing what is healthy, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, it’s perfectly alright to enjoy a good burger! It’s good you’re drinking water, that's excellent. It's not about avoiding things entirely, but looking at how they might be affecting you. Let's talk a bit more about your diet, and then I'd like to ask a few other questions, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Questions are fine. I will answer as best I can. And talking about the diet… perhaps you can tell me what I should not eat so much of? I do not want to… upset my stomach further. It is already quite noisy, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Well, some foods are more likely to cause gas than others. Things like beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions… and fried foods can sometimes be culprits. Burgers and fries fall into that category. Do you notice any specific foods seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Beans, no. Broccoli, sometimes. But the burgers… yes, I think the burgers are the worst. Especially if I eat a large one. Or two. I do enjoy two sometimes. And… the onions. Yes, the onions on the burger. They make it… extra loud, I believe. But I like the onions. It is a difficult situation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burgers, especially with onions, seem to be the biggest trigger. It’s good you’re noticing that. We don’t need to eliminate them completely, but perhaps reducing the amount, or eating them less frequently, could help. Now, aside from the gas, have you noticed any other changes in your digestion?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Everything… passes, you understand? It is just… a lot of it. And noisy. No pain, no… different colors. Everything is… normal, except for the volume. And the… smell. It is not pleasant, I will admit. But no other changes, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no changes in bowel movements, just increased volume and odor. And no fever or weight loss, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. No fever, no weight loss. I… I may have gained a little weight, if anything. From the burgers, perhaps? I do not exercise much, I will be honest. I stand at work, but that is… not the same, is it?
DOCTOR: No, standing isn’t quite the same as dedicated exercise. Alright, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I know of. I have not been to a doctor in… many years, truthfully. Just for check-ups, when I was a little boy. I mostly stay healthy, I think. Just… gassy lately. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach, when she was old, but I do not think it was the same. It was… different. More painful, I believe. But me? No diagnoses. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous diagnoses. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None. Never been in the hospital. Never had an operation. I am… quite lucky, I think. Just this… gas. It is my biggest problem. I worry it will… bother the other people at work, you see? They are very nice, but… still. It is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re aware of it and concerned about being considerate of your coworkers. Alright, one last quick thing about your family. Does anyone in your family have issues with digestion, like irritable bowel or bloating, besides your mother?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My father… he always complained of heartburn, I believe. But that is not the same, is it? And my sister… she does worry a lot about what she eats. But I do not think she has problems, exactly. She is just… careful. I do not know if that counts. Everyone in my family eats… mostly normal foods, I think. No one else has… excessive gas, like me. Just me. It is… peculiar.
DOCTOR: Okay, no one else with similar issues, just your father with heartburn and your sister being cautious about her diet. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, thank you for that information. It sounds like you're generally healthy, and this gas issue has come on relatively recently. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like this is likely related to your diet, specifically the burgers and onions. I'd like to start with some simple dietary changes and see if that helps. We’ve already talked about reducing the amount of burgers and onions you eat. Do you think you’d be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am willing to try. I do not want to be… a nuisance at work, you understand? And if reducing the burgers helps, then I am happy to do it. Perhaps… one burger instead of two? And… I will ask them to put less onion on it. Is that a sensible plan? It may be… difficult. I do enjoy a good burger. But I will try. For my coworkers. And for my stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible plan, Mr. Goodstein. One burger instead of two, and less onion – excellent. It's about finding a balance, not complete deprivation. We can also talk about some over-the-counter remedies that can help relieve gas, if needed. Things like simethicone or activated charcoal. Have you ever tried anything like that before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I do not know what those things are, truthfully. Simethicone… activated charcoal… they sound… complicated. Are they safe? I do not want to take anything that will… upset my stomach more, you understand? I am a little wary of taking pills, if I am being honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. Simethicone is generally very safe, it helps break up gas bubbles. Activated charcoal can absorb gas, but it can interact with certain medications, so we’d need to be careful if you’re taking anything else. Since you’re not currently on any medications, it’s likely fine, but let’s stick with the dietary changes for now and see how that goes. If you’re still experiencing significant gas after a week or two, we can revisit the possibility of trying one of those remedies. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water, eating slowly, and trying to avoid swallowing too much air. Are you okay with trying those simple changes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am okay with those changes. Water, eating slowly… avoiding air. It sounds… manageable. I will try my best. And I will reduce the burgers and onion. One burger, less onion. It is a promise. If it does not help… then we can talk about the other things, the pills. But I will try this first. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. And… not judgmental. That is… appreciated.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right to start with the simplest changes first. Remember, it's okay if it takes a little time to see improvement. If things don't get better, or if you develop any new symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel movements, please don't hesitate to call the office. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have answered all my questions, and you have given me a sensible plan. I will follow it. Thank you again. It is… reassuring to know that it is likely just the burgers. And not something… serious. I appreciate your time. And your patience. This was… helpful. Truly. I think I will go home now and… perhaps have a salad. A small salad, before I go back to work.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Mr. Goodstein. A small salad is a perfect start. I’m glad I could ease your mind, and remember, we’re here if you need anything. Have a good day, and enjoy your salad!
PATIENT: Thank you. You have a good day as well. .
