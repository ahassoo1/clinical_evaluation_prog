DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly? A friend suggested I come talk about… well, preventing HIV. She said there's a pill you can take, and I figured it couldn't hurt to learn more. I’m Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Helaina. It’s certainly wise to be proactive about your health. And yes, you are correct. There is medication available as a preventative measure against HIV, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Before we discuss PrEP in detail, I'd like to gather a bit more information about your overall health and risk factors. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need to know, Doctor. I don't have any big health problems, if that helps. Just… getting older, I suppose. Medicare covers everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Helaina, and Medicare coverage is certainly a benefit. Let's start with a bit more detail about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had any of those. Blood pressure’s usually a little high when the nurses take it, but they say it’s just nerves. Otherwise, pretty healthy. I used to walk a lot, but… well, things change.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. And once, when I tripped and broke my wrist, but that was ages ago. Nothing since then, honestly. No major illnesses, no serious injuries. Just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture. Thank you for that information. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's a tough one. My mother had some heart trouble later in life, and my father… he had diabetes. And my brother, he’s got high blood pressure, like me. Everyone seems to have something, doesn't it? It’s a Palestinian family – lots of good food, not enough walking, I think.
DOCTOR: It does seem to run in families sometimes, yes. Thank you for sharing that. Now, regarding your social history… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never touched any of that. Always thought it was a waste of money and bad for your health. I drink a lot of tea, though. Palestinian tea, very strong. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That doesn't count, Helaina, not at all! Tea is quite healthy, actually. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me, and I've taken plenty of pills in my time for headaches and such. Never had a reaction. I think I'd remember that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly would. That’s all very helpful information, thank you. Now, let's talk a little more specifically about why you’re interested in PrEP. Could you tell me about your risk factors for HIV?
PATIENT: Well… this is a little embarrassing to talk about. I'm single, and I do… have occasional romantic partners. I don’t always know their history, and my friend said it's just smart to be careful, you know? It's not something I think about every time, but she made me realize I should be protecting myself. It's better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Helaina. It is always better to be safe, and it takes courage to be proactive about your health. Your friend gave you excellent advice. Knowing your risk factors is an important first step. To determine if PrEP is right for you, we’ll need to do a few things. First, we’ll need to perform a physical exam and order some blood tests to assess your overall health and confirm you don’t currently have an HIV infection. We also need to rule out other sexually transmitted infections. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever tests you need to do, go ahead. I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. Is there anything bad about taking the pill? Side effects or something? I always worry about that.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Helaina, and it's important to be aware of potential side effects. Most people who take PrEP experience very few, if any, side effects. The most common ones are mild – things like nausea, fatigue, or headache, especially when you first start taking it. These usually go away within a few weeks. Rarely, some people may experience more serious side effects, such as kidney problems or bone density changes, which is why we’ll need to monitor your kidney function and bone density with regular blood tests. We’ll also need to check for any interactions with other medications you might be taking. It’s also important to remember that PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections, so safe sex practices – using condoms – are still very important. Would you like me to explain the blood tests in more detail, or shall we proceed with the physical exam?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. Just a few blood tests. I can handle that. And yes, I definitely understand about the condoms. My mother drilled that into my head since I was a little girl! Let's just get the tests done. The sooner I know what's going on, the better. I'm ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, let's begin then. We'll start with a quick physical exam – I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a general assessment. Then, the nurse will draw some blood. It will only take a few minutes. If you could please sit up on the table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. Just tell me what you need me to do, Doctor. I’m a bit squeamish, so be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but likely due to nerves as you mentioned earlier. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Everything appears normal so far. Do you have any areas of pain or discomfort I should focus on?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just my old knees sometimes ache when the weather changes, but that’s it. Everything else feels… normal. I appreciate you being so gentle, Doctor. It’s nice not to feel rushed.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I want you to feel comfortable and at ease. Alright, that completes the physical exam portion. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will be sent to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about this. I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse then. I suppose it's best to get it over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be with you shortly, and she'll explain the blood draw process. Please don't hesitate to ask her if you have any questions. I'll be reviewing your results as soon as they come in and will contact you to discuss them further. Have a comfortable wait.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
