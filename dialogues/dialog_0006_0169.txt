DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Right. Well, it's this… puffiness, you see. Face, legs… all a bit swollen. Feels strange. Not painful, exactly. Just… big. I noticed it a few days ago, I think. Hard to say for sure, time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffiness… a few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few days. Maybe a week? Honestly, doc, I don't keep track of these things. My wife, bless her soul, she always remembered dates and whatnot. Now… it’s just… gone to pot, I suppose. It’s not like it hurts, you understand. Just… noticeable. And kinda uncomfortable when I try to put my boots on.
DOCTOR: Right, not painful, just uncomfortable with your boots. Okay. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? I… I don't know. Same old, same old, mostly. I go to work, I come home, I eat… I haven’t been traveling or anything. Not like that matters. I eat the same things I always have. Meat and potatoes, mostly. Though… old man Hemmings next door, he gave me some of his garden tomatoes. Big ones. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know. Tomatoes seem… watery.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's try to narrow things down. You mentioned work… what kind of work do you do, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Welding, mostly. Been doing it for… oh, goodness, forty years now. Soldering, brazing too. Machine stuff. Stands and operates 'em. It’s hot work, naturally. Always has been. Though I haven’t been standing quite as much lately. Old knees, you know. Boss lets me sit down more now. Though that doesn't explain the face, does it?
DOCTOR: Okay, welding… and you've noticed some knee trouble lately. Let's take a look at your legs and feet, and I’ll check your face. Just to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Could you sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Exam table, huh? Alright. Oh, these old bones ain't what they used to be. Go easy on me now. What exactly are you lookin' for? You're gonna poke and prod, I suppose? I don’t mind, but I'd appreciate a warning, you know. Never been a fan of surprises.
DOCTOR: Just a quick look, Mr. Miner, nothing to worry about. I’m going to feel for any tenderness, check your pulses, and see how much swelling there is. I’ll tell you what I'm doing before I do it. First, let's just take a look at your ankles... Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit tender, yeah. Right… there. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, really. Been feeling a bit achy all over lately, truth be told. Thought it was just getting old. Never thought it'd be my face puffin' up, too. Feels strange, like I ate a lemon or something. Though I haven’t had a lemon in years… Wife didn’t care for ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness and swelling on both sides, but more pronounced on the left. And you’re achy all over. Let me check your pulses. Pulses feel a little weak… not alarmingly so, but weaker than I’d expect. Can you describe the swelling on your face?
PATIENT: Weak pulses, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? Swelling on my face… hmm. It’s all over, really. Cheeks, around my eyes… even my lips feel a bit thick. Makes me look like a… a pufferfish, I suppose. It’s not red or anything, just… puffy. And kinda… tight. Feels like I'm wearing a mask, almost. Hard to explain. It just is. And it’s bothersome. Makes eatin' a bit of a chore, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Miner. Weak pulses, swelling in your legs and face, and feeling of tightness… And you've mentioned changes in your work routine recently. Given all that, I think we need to run some tests to figure out what's going on. I’m thinking a blood test, and possibly an EKG to check your heart. I also want to check your kidneys, just to be safe. Would you be willing to let us draw some blood?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Always something, isn't it? Blood tests… I don’t much like needles. But… if you think it’s important… alright. Do what you gotta do. But be gentle, now. And tell me what you’re lookin’ for. I don't like surprises, you remember. What's all this about my kidneys? I feel fine… mostly. Just this puffiness and the achin'. Is it serious, doc? Be straight with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Miner, I understand your concerns. We're going to check several things with the blood test. It will help us see how well your kidneys are functioning, check your electrolytes, and rule out any infection. The EKG is just a quick scan of your heart to make sure everything is working normally, since swelling can sometimes be related to heart issues. It’s a standard precaution given your symptoms. And yes, it's possible this is something serious, and we need to find out what’s causing the swelling. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. And I’ll get the EKG ordered as well. We'll get the results back as quickly as we can. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time… I suppose that's all anyone can do. Blood tests and a heart scan… it’s a lot. Nurse, you say? Be gentle, now. And explain what you’re doin’. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded without knowin’ why. Will you be back after the nurse is done? I might have questions… lots of 'em, I reckon. And I still don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Miner. I'll be right here after the nurse is done, and we can go over the results and answer any questions you have. I’ll make sure the nurse explains everything clearly before she starts. We’ll take all the time you need. Just try to relax. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready. And remember, we're just gathering information right now. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong.
PATIENT: .
