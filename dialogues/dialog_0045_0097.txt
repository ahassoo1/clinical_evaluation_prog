DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s about… planning, shall we say. My husband and I were discussing… what if something were to happen. We’d like to have some forms completed, just in case. Something official, stating what… preferences I have regarding medical care. I believe it’s called an Advance Directive? Or perhaps a POLST form? I’m not entirely sure of the correct terminology, truthfully. It’s simply… prudent to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Right, “planning.” Look, a lot of people waste my time with this stuff, frankly. But alright. Advance Directive, POLST… they're both essentially telling me what you want if you can’t tell me. It's good you're thinking about it, I suppose. Though, at 44, you’re probably getting ahead of yourself. First, let’s clarify. Do you have any specific medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: “Getting ahead of myself”? Doctor, with all due respect, one doesn’t simply choose when unforeseen circumstances may arise. It’s called responsibility. As for medical conditions… no, nothing of any significance. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. A good diet, regular exercise… I assure you, I am not one to burden the healthcare system. Perhaps a touch of seasonal allergies, but that hardly seems relevant to this discussion. I would like to simply outline my wishes, should… something unfortunate occur. It’s about control, Doctor. Having a say in my own destiny.
DOCTOR: Right, "control." Look, I've seen plenty of healthy people end up in the ICU. Don't think you're exempt just because you eat your greens. Okay, so no major conditions. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: That is… a rather insensitive remark, Doctor. I fail to see the necessity of such pessimism. However, to answer your question, no. I have never undergone any surgical procedures. I pride myself on maintaining my physical integrity, and I have always been very careful to avoid unnecessary risks. I believe preventative care is far superior to reactive treatment. Now, are we going to discuss the forms, or are you going to continue to… question my lifestyle choices?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No surgeries. Just trying to get a complete picture here. Family history?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we delve into the ailments of my relatives? It’s hardly relevant to my health. However, if you insist… my mother had some issues with her blood pressure in her later years. My father… well, he lived a long and relatively healthy life, though he did have a weak heart. But again, I assure you, I am not predisposed to any debilitating illnesses. I have always been very… resilient. Can we please focus on the Advance Directive now? I have other commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Resilient doesn't stop genetics, Ms. Chilla. Alright, blood pressure in your mother, weak heart in your father. Noted. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor Billman, are you implying something? I find that question rather… offensive. I have never touched a cigarette in my life! The very idea! I maintain a very refined lifestyle, and that includes abstaining from such… vulgar habits. I exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and surround myself with intellectually stimulating company. It’s quite clear I prioritize my well-being. Honestly, I am beginning to question your professional demeanor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, perhaps we could revisit the purpose of this appointment? The Advance Directive, if you recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no smoking. Just covering all the bases. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, are you conducting an interrogation? I fail to see how my social habits are relevant to outlining my medical preferences. However, to satisfy your… curiosity, I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. A small glass. Red wine, of course. For the antioxidants. It’s hardly excessive. I assure you, I do not engage in any sort of… reckless behavior. Now, can we please move on to the Advance Directive? I have a luncheon scheduled shortly, and I’d like to be punctual. This is becoming quite tiresome.
DOCTOR: Fine. Small glass of wine. Look, I'm just trying to get a complete picture. Allergies?
PATIENT: Doctor, you’ve established that I have seasonal allergies. I mentioned it earlier, if you recall. Pollen, primarily. It’s a minor inconvenience, easily managed with over-the-counter medication. I fail to understand why you continue to dwell on these trivial details. Are we discussing my medical history, or are we compiling a list of my personal preferences? I would appreciate it if you would focus on the Advance Directive. It is, after all, the reason I am here. I have limited patience for this… exhaustive questioning.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Seasonal allergies. Look, Ms. Chilla, I'm going to be blunt. You seem very concerned with appearing healthy. But everyone has something. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Blunt? I find that remark incredibly presumptuous, Doctor. My concern is with preserving my autonomy, not with “appearing” healthy. I maintain a robust lifestyle, which naturally leads to good health. I take a daily multivitamin, for general well-being. And, as I previously mentioned, I occasionally use over-the-counter antihistamines during allergy season. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I am starting to feel quite… patronized. Are we going to discuss the Advance Directive, or are you determined to dissect my every habit? I have a life, Doctor, and I would appreciate it if you would respect my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin, occasional antihistamines. Look, Ms. Chilla, you're very...particular. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs. Standard stuff. Don't get your feathers ruffled. If you'll just step over here…
PATIENT: A “quick physical exam”? After all this… interrogation? Doctor, I came here to discuss an Advance Directive, not to be subjected to a condescending assessment. Frankly, it feels rather… unnecessary. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. However, if it is absolutely required to complete the forms, I suppose I can comply. But I expect a swift and professional examination. And I would appreciate it if you would refrain from making any further assumptions about my health. Now, let us proceed. But please, be gentle. I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Just a quick look. Sit up straight. 130 over 80. Not bad, but keep an eye on it. Deep breath… and another… Lungs are clear. Pulse is 72, regular. Okay, everything seems normal. But honestly, you're a little tense. That can throw things off. Now, do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: “A little tense”? Doctor, I am perfectly composed. I simply find this entire process… unsettling. And frankly, your demeanor is not helping. As for pain, no. I do not experience any chronic pain. Occasionally, a mild ache after exercise, but that is to be expected. I maintain an active lifestyle, as we have established. Now, if we could please move on to the Advance Directive? I am growing increasingly impatient. I would like to outline my wishes and be on my way. This is becoming quite… tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No pain. Look, Ms. Chilla, I'm going to be honest with you. You're a bit… difficult. You seem very focused on projecting an image of perfect health, and you're resistant to any suggestion otherwise. That makes it hard to get a clear picture. But fine. We'll do the Advance Directive. Okay, so an Advance Directive… basically, you want to tell me what kind of medical care you want if you can't speak for yourself. Do you want to designate a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, Doctor, a healthcare proxy is precisely what I had in mind. My husband, Omar, would be my designated proxy. He is a very pragmatic and responsible individual, and I trust his judgment implicitly. He understands my wishes perfectly, and he would advocate for my best interests without hesitation. Please, let us document that immediately. I would feel considerably more at ease knowing that he is authorized to make decisions on my behalf. Now, are there any specific forms or documents I need to complete? I would like to expedite this process as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Omar. We'll need his full name, date of birth, and contact information. And you'll both need to sign the document. Now, about what kind of care you want… Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… that is a rather… weighty matter. Omar and I have discussed this at length. While I value life, I also believe in respecting the natural order. I do not wish to be resuscitated if my chances of recovery are minimal, and my quality of life would be severely compromised. I would prefer a “do not resuscitate” order, should such a situation arise. However, if there is a reasonable chance of recovery, I would, of course, want all necessary measures taken. It is a delicate balance, Doctor. And I trust Omar to make the appropriate decision, in accordance with my wishes. Now, is there a specific form for that? Or do we simply document it in writing?
DOCTOR: Okay. "Do Not Resuscitate." That's a POLST form, Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. It’s more specific than a general Advance Directive. Here. You and Omar need to fill this out and sign it. It needs to be very clear what kind of treatment you want, and what you don’t want. It also needs to be reviewed by a physician. Pay close attention to the section on artificial ventilation, feeding tubes, and antibiotics. Do you want those if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery?
PATIENT: Artificial ventilation… feeding tubes… antibiotics… It is rather… clinical, isn’t it? Omar and I have discussed these scenarios as well. In the event of a severe and irreversible condition, with no reasonable prospect of recovery, I would not wish to be subjected to life-sustaining measures. I would prefer comfort care, and a peaceful passing, if such is my fate. I do not wish to prolong suffering unnecessarily. It is a difficult decision, Doctor, but I am resolute in my wishes. Now, is there any assistance available to help us complete this form? It is rather… complex, and I would like to ensure that all our preferences are accurately documented. Perhaps a nurse could provide some guidance?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Chilla, I've explained everything. It's not that complicated. It's about making your wishes clear. If you want, I can have a nurse briefly review it with you, but I don't have time to sit here and hold your hand through every detail. Nurse Patel, could you come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A brief review would be appreciated. I simply wish to ensure that everything is documented accurately and comprehensively. It is a matter of peace of mind, you understand. And perhaps, a reassurance that my wishes will be respected. Thank you for arranging for Nurse Patel’s assistance. I trust she will be able to clarify any remaining concerns. Now, let us await her arrival. Hopefully, she possesses a more… patient disposition.
DOCTOR: Nurse Patel, Ms. Chilla has some questions about the POLST form. Could you go over it with her?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. Nurse, my husband and I are completing this POLST form, and while we understand the general principles, we would appreciate some guidance regarding the specific options and their implications. Specifically, we are unsure about the level of detail required when outlining our preferences regarding artificial ventilation, feeding tubes, and antibiotics. Perhaps you could provide some clarification? We would also like to ensure that the form accurately reflects our wishes regarding a “do not resuscitate” order. Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
