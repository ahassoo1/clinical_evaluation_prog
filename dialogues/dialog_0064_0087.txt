DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I can't quite recall why, but someone told me I needed it done. Gets a bit foggy, you know? Just want to get it over with, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly alright. Memory can be tricky as we get older. We can certainly get some lab work done. Let me just pull up your record here… Ah, yes. It looks like you had a routine check-up about six months ago, and the doctor ordered some follow-up blood tests to monitor your cholesterol and kidney function. Is that sounding right?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… kidneys… Hmm. Sounds…familiar, maybe? I really don't remember the specifics, Doctor. I just… get a bit lost in the details these days. If that's what it is, then yes, I suppose. As long as it’s not too complicated. I haven't got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll keep it as straightforward as possible. We can definitely focus on just those tests for now. Before we proceed, just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes… well, I’m old, so things are always changing, aren't they? No, not really. I get tired easily, but that's been the case for years. Appetite’s alright. No new aches or pains that I can recall. Just… the usual getting old stuff. Is that helpful? Honestly, I wouldn't notice if something was terribly wrong half the time.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. It's good to know you haven’t noticed anything new. Now, just a few quick questions, if you don't mind. Any trouble with urination – frequency, urgency, or any pain?
PATIENT: Urination? No… no trouble. Not that I remember. I go… when I need to go. Look, Doctor, are we nearly done with the questions? I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, and I’d like to get this over with. I’ve got a bit of a schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We're almost there. Just a couple more quick things, and then we can get to the blood work. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while… No, I don’t think so. My wife, bless her soul, she was the healthy one, always watching what she ate. I mostly just… ate. I don’t think I ever had diabetes. But, like I said, my memory isn't what it used to be. Are you sure?
DOCTOR: According to your records, no history of diabetes, sir. Just checking to be certain. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. Oh! I take a little something for my… well, I forget what it's for, actually. It's a small white pill. My neighbor reminds me to take it every morning. She’s a very helpful woman. I don't know what it does, exactly. Is that useful? Honestly, Doctor, I barely keep track of these things. It's just... a pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill, taken daily, for an unknown reason. We'll need to figure that out. It’s very important to know what medications you are taking, even if you don’t remember why. Now, before we get to the lab work, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my… heart? Look, Doctor, I really just came for the lab work. I’m not feeling ill, and I don’t see the point in poking around. I'm a simple man, and I'd like to keep it that way. Can’t we just skip that part? I'm sure my heart’s fine, and I haven't got any aches or pains to feel. I’m a bit pressed for time, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Croonquist. However, a quick exam is a standard part of any medical visit, even if you’re feeling well. It helps me get a baseline understanding of your overall health and can sometimes reveal subtle issues we wouldn’t otherwise know about. It really won’t take long – just a few minutes. If you’re particularly uncomfortable, we can keep it brief. Would you at least allow me to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Just… quick, please. And don't poke around too much. I'm a sensitive man, you know. Blood pressure and… the heart thing. That’s it. No poking and prodding. Let's just get this over with. The sooner we do the lab work, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Quick and gentle, I promise. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur is present, likely benign given your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright, that’s all. Now we can proceed to the lab work. I’ll have the nurse draw a few vials of blood. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Good. Finally. Just get it done quickly, please. The sooner this is over, the better. I've got things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll let the nurse know to be as quick as possible. She’ll be in shortly. While you’re waiting, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, no. Just the lab work, please. That's all I came for. I don't want to waste your time, Doctor. I'm a simple man with simple needs. Let’s just get it done. The quicker, the better. Really. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. I'll inform the nurse to come in right away. Thank you for your patience. .
