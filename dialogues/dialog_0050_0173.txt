DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Aslan. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Paraskevopoulos, nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve just been getting chills lately. It’s kinda weird, it doesn’t seem to be from being cold or anything.
DOCTOR: Chills, you say. And you haven't noticed any correlation with temperature changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, it was pretty warm yesterday, and I still felt a bit shaky. It's not like a full-on fever, just...the chills. It's a bit annoying, honestly. Like I need a blanket even when I shouldn't.
DOCTOR: Interesting. And how long has this been occurring, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... probably for about a week now? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, just feeling a bit off, and then it got to the point where I noticed the chills were happening pretty regularly. I didn't really think much of it at first, figured I was just tired.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And are these chills constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They definitely come and go. It's not like I'm shivering all day. It's more like... waves? They'll hit me, I'll feel cold for maybe 20 minutes or so, then it'll pass. Sometimes they happen a few times a day, other times not at all. It’s hard to predict, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed anything else accompanying these chills, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Um... let me see. I've been a little more tired than usual, yeah. And maybe a bit achy? Not like, painful achy, just...sore, all over. It’s hard to say if that's just from work, though. I’m on my feet a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And where do you work, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: I'm a Health Education Specialist. I work with a community center, mostly doing workshops and outreach programs. Lots of talking and moving around, setting up things, you know? It can be pretty demanding physically, even though it doesn't seem like it. Sometimes I’m outside too, doing stuff with the garden.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s delve a little deeper. Have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think carefully. No, not really. No cough, no sore throat, no runny nose. No stomach problems or anything like that. I haven’t lost my appetite, and I’m sleeping okay, besides being a bit tired. Honestly, it’s mostly just the chills and the mild aches. It's kinda frustrating because I don’t feel sick, sick, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, to summarize, you've been experiencing chills and mild body aches for approximately a week, without any other typical cold or flu symptoms. No fever, cough, congestion, gastrointestinal issues, or appetite loss. Now, Ms. Aslan, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not at all. I haven’t left the city in months, to be honest. Work’s been pretty busy, and I haven’t really had the chance. And even if I did, I wouldn't have been able to afford it!
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, usually. And sometimes I'll take ibuprofen for headaches, if I need it, but that's it. Nothing regular, nothing for a specific condition or anything. I generally try to stay away from medication if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty careful about what I eat, and I always check labels. No hay fever or anything like that either. I think I'd remember if I had an allergy!
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, all that – but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized or had any surgeries. My doctor always said I was pretty healthy, honestly. Just the normal checkups and stuff.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Um, let me think… My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart issues when he was older, but other than that, nothing major. No history of autoimmune diseases or anything like that on either side of the family, as far as I know. It’s not something we talk about a lot, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, Ms. Aslan, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I don’t smoke, I hardly ever drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas – and I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to stay healthy, like I said. I exercise when I can and eat pretty well.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Aslan. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable or anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, that would be wonderful. First, I will check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your throat and lymph nodes. It shouldn’t be anything too invasive.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Aslan. First, let’s take your temperature. Normal. 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, your pulse. 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is 128 over 78. Within normal limits. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly… Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Now, one more deep breath… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs appreciated. Now, open your mouth for me, please. Throat appears normal, no visible inflammation or lesions. Finally, I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. All normal. Everything appears within normal limits on initial examination. However, given your reported chills and mild aches, and the lack of other overt symptoms, it’s somewhat puzzling.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear, I guess? But also, confusing, since I am feeling these chills. So, what does that mean? What could it be if everything seems normal? Is it…stress? I have been a little stressed at work lately.
DOCTOR: It could be stress, Ms. Aslan, and that’s a reasonable consideration, particularly given your workload. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, even if the initial physical exam is unremarkable. It’s always best to be thorough. I'm going to order some routine blood work. It will include a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Additionally, I’d like to check your thyroid levels, as thyroid abnormalities can sometimes present with symptoms similar to yours. I'll also order a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle aches. These tests should give us a clearer picture of what might be going on. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… sensible. Checking everything makes sense. And no, I don't think I have any questions about that. How long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to come back for another appointment once they are?
DOCTOR: Typically, the results should be available within 48 to 72 hours. The lab will notify my office directly when they are ready. Once we have the results, we'll review them together. If everything is normal, we can discuss stress management techniques and lifestyle adjustments. If we do find any abnormalities, we'll discuss appropriate treatment options. Yes, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment, regardless of the results, to ensure we address your concerns thoroughly. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds good. Whenever is convenient for you. I'm pretty flexible. And thank you, Dr. Paraskevopoulos. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run the tests, even though I feel a bit silly being here when everything seems normal.
DOCTOR: It’s my job to investigate any concerns you have, Ms. Aslan. It's far better to be thorough, even if the initial assessment is unremarkable. Now, let's schedule that follow-up appointment. My office will contact you to confirm a time. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as developing a fever, experiencing severe fatigue, or having difficulty breathing – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Paraskevopoulos. I’ll wait to hear from the office about the appointment. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Aslan. We’ll be in touch. The nurse will escort you to schedule your follow-up and provide you with instructions for the blood work. .
