DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. I see you're here today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's my liver, I think. Or something with my liver. It’s…yellow. My skin, I mean. It’s been…noticeable lately. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy, and I haven’t been feeling quite myself. I just…want to know what’s going on, if you can help me understand.
DOCTOR: Yellowing of the skin… I understand. That's certainly something we need to investigate. And you say you haven't been feeling quite yourself – can you elaborate on that, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elaborate… Yes, well, I'm tired. Very tired. And not hungry, which isn’t like me at all. A little… achy, too, mostly in my tummy. It’s hard to explain. Things just feel… off. It's been going on for… a while now, I suppose. Weeks, maybe? I really can't put a precise date on it. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say. And the fatigue, loss of appetite, and abdominal discomfort… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel movements. Goodness. Let me think. They’ve been… paler, I think. Lighter in color. And… not as often as usual. It’s all rather unpleasant to discuss, Doctor. Is that… important? I'm sorry, I don’t mean to be difficult. It's just…my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Durig. No need to apologize at all; these details help me understand what's happening. Pale stools… We're building a picture here. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little bit of nausea, mostly in the mornings. And… once or twice, I’ve been sick, yes. But not much. Just a little. It didn't last long, thankfully. Is this…bad? Should I be worried? I feel foolish asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, Ms. Durig. It’s my job to address your concerns. Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s a tricky one. I’ve seen many doctors over the years. I think I had something with my gallbladder, a long time ago. They took it out, I believe. And… something with my blood pressure. But honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. I’m afraid I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… alright. And high blood pressure, potentially. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh… medications. Let me see… I used to take a pill, a little white one, for my blood pressure. But I stopped taking it years ago. The doctor said it wasn’t necessary anymore. And…that’s all I can recall, I’m afraid. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I apologize for being so… forgetful. Is this delaying things? I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Durig, it isn't delaying things, but accurate information is vital. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don’t think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Though, my skin does get a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just my age. And the weather, of course. I don’t think that counts as an allergy, does it? I'm truly sorry if I'm not being helpful, Doctor. I wish I could remember things more clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s… difficult. My family is quite large, and spread out. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. And my brother, he had diabetes. But that was many years ago, and I don’t recall any specifics. Honestly, Doctor, I was never very good at remembering these things. I apologize. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Durig. Now, before we proceed, let me ask about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh… alcohol. Well, I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But that was a long time ago. Now, I hardly drink at all. Perhaps a small sherry at Christmas. Nothing regular, I assure you. Is that… relevant? I just want to get this sorted, Doctor. It's unsettling not knowing what's happening.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Durig, I’m going to need to conduct a physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical examination… very well. I suppose it's necessary. Please, be gentle, Doctor. And…do let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm rather nervous, I must confess. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. Take a deep breath for me…and exhale. Your breathing sounds slightly diminished on the lower left lobe. And your abdomen is…tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. There's also some mild guarding. It’s not severe, but it's present. I'm going to need to order some blood tests, Ms. Durig, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level. We'll also need to schedule an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver and gallbladder.
