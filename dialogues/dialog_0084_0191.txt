DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s… something I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand? It’s better to know, I always say.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. That's a very responsible thing to do. It is always better to know. And just so I have a complete picture, have you had any specific concerns that led you to request this test, or is this more of a routine check, just for peace of mind?
PATIENT: Routine, I suppose. Though… not entirely. My husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we should lately. Not that anything happened, exactly. But… well, it’s been on my mind. And with my age… one hears things. It’s just… a precaution, really. I haven't had any specific symptoms, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s good to be thorough. You mentioned your husband; have either of you been tested previously?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t believe so, no. Not that I recall, anyway. It was… a long time ago when that sort of thing was more… unspoken, you see. And we’ve been together for quite a while now. He's a good man, my husband. But… best to be certain for both of us, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. It’s never a bad idea to get tested, regardless of how long you’ve been together. To clarify, when you say “not as careful,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… we haven’t been using protection regularly. It started… gradually, really. We’ve been married for thirty-five years, you see. And… things change. We just… stopped, I suppose. It felt… comfortable. Foolish, maybe, now that I say it out loud. But it wasn’t like anything wild, if that’s what you’re implying. Just… normal intimacy. We are both very faithful, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Shaub. That gives me a clearer picture. Just to be comprehensive, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? Let me think… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve had a few surgeries over the years – a hysterectomy, a knee replacement… but I don’t recall ever receiving a transfusion. I would think I’d remember something like that, wouldn’t I? It sounds… serious.
DOCTOR: You would, yes. It's good to double-check. And just to cover all bases, have you ever shared needles for any reason – for example, recreational drug use, or for medical purposes like diabetes treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I have never… I don’t even know anyone who does such a thing. I have never used recreational drugs, and I do not have diabetes. My husband and I… we’re very healthy people, all things considered. We enjoy gardening, and walking… and church, of course. This is a bit… invasive, isn't it? Not that I'm being difficult, you understand. It's just… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Shaub. These questions are standard procedure when assessing risk factors for HIV, and I apologize if they feel intrusive. It's important to be thorough, and I want to ensure we cover all possibilities. Okay, let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Well, I am allergic to penicillin. It gives me a terrible rash, and makes me quite unwell. I discovered that as a child, unfortunately. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. I have a bit of high blood pressure, which I take medication for, but that’s all. Nothing serious, the doctor assures me. Just needs to be managed. Do I need to list every little thing? This is getting rather long, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the penicillin allergy; I've made a note of that. And no, you don't need to list every little thing. Just anything significant. You mentioned medication for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… let me see… Amlodipine. Five milligrams, taken once a day in the morning. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, probably five years now? Maybe longer. It keeps things stable, thankfully. The doctor says my numbers are good, as long as I remember to take it. Old age, you know. Things start to slip your mind. Though I'm not that old! Sixty-four, but still… quite active.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Shaub. Thank you. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations other than the ones you mentioned earlier – the hysterectomy and the knee replacement?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. Must have been… twenty years ago now? It was quite painful, but a fairly simple procedure, the doctor said. And… I was hospitalized once as a child, with a bad case of pneumonia, but that was a very long time ago. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing significant. Are we getting closer to the test, Doctor? I’m not trying to rush you, but… I’m a bit anxious, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Shaub. We are getting closer. Just a few more questions, and then we can proceed with the testing. Do you have any family history of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Not that I’m aware of. My family… we’re a very… reserved bunch. Such things weren’t discussed openly, even now. We didn’t… fraternize, you see. We’re Nigerian, and… well, there were expectations. My parents would have been horrified. So, no, I don't believe so. No family history of anything like that. I truly hope I'm not coming across as rude. It’s just… these questions are rather personal.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shaub. You’re not being rude in the slightest. I understand that these questions can be sensitive, and I appreciate you answering them so openly. Okay, one final area to cover – your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Never have, never will. My husband and I… we enjoy a good cup of tea, that’s all. And perhaps a small glass of sherry on special occasions, but that’s it. We lead a very clean life, you see. Church on Sundays, gardening during the week… we’re not the sort to engage in… reckless behavior. Is that the last of it? I’m terribly sorry to be so… detailed, but I want you to have a complete picture. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shaub, you haven’t been at all. And you’re not being detailed; you’re being thorough, and I appreciate that. That completes the necessary questions. Now, we can proceed with the HIV test. We can do a blood draw here in the office, and the results usually take about 20 minutes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Twenty minutes is no trouble at all. I’m glad we’ve gotten through all of that. It’s… a weight off my mind, to be honest. Thank you, Doctor. Please, let’s get it over with. I trust your judgment implicitly. Just… try not to poke too much, if you would be so kind. I do dislike needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let's go to the lab, and we’ll get this done quickly. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very skilled. It will be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I do hope everything is alright. But even if it isn't… well, knowing is better than wondering, I suppose. Lead the way.
