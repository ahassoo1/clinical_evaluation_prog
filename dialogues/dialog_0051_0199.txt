DOCTOR: Good morning, Marquie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi Doctor. It's… it's my breathing. It's been kinda hard, you know? Like, I get really short of breath sometimes. I don't… I don't really know when it started, exactly. It just… is. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Marquie. It's common to have trouble putting things into words. “Kinda hard” is a good starting point. And it’s alright that you don't know exactly when it started. Let’s try to get a better idea of what's going on. When you say “hard,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s like… I gotta really work to get air in. Like my lungs are… tight? And it feels like I can’t get enough, even when I’m just sitting still. Sometimes it feels… wheezy, I guess? My wife mentioned it sounds that way when I sleep. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, this is all kinda vague. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Marquie, this is very helpful. “Tight” and “wheezy” give me a good picture. And it's good your wife has noticed the wheezing – that’s a useful detail. So, it happens even when you’re resting?
PATIENT: Yeah… mostly. It’s worse when I, uh… when I move around, definitely. Like, if I walk up the stairs, or even just bend over to pick something up. But even when I’m just sitting and watching TV, sometimes I feel it. Not as bad, but it’s… there. It's been happening more lately, I think. I'm… honestly, I haven’t been paying super close attention. Things have been… busy.
DOCTOR: I understand, life gets busy. “Happening more lately” is good to know. Okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, other than activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels worse when it’s… humid, I think? Like, really sticky air. And maybe… maybe when there’s a lot of dust around? We live kinda close to a farm, so sometimes it gets dusty. I don’t know for sure, but those seem to be times when it's harder to breathe. I haven't noticed anything that helps, really. Just… sitting still, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, humidity and dust are potential triggers, that’s useful. Have you ever had anything like this happen before – any history of asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or other lung problems?
PATIENT: Ugh… honestly? I really don’t remember. I was… pretty sick as a kid, my mom always said, but I don't recall anything specific about my lungs. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. Maybe since my son was born? He’s… seven now. I really don't know. Sorry, I'm not much help with that part. I’m bad with dates and remembering old stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Marquie. We’ll figure it out. We can look at your records if you've seen a doctor before. Let's move on. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke. My wife… she used to, a long time ago, but she quit years and years ago. I’ve always been pretty careful about that sort of thing. It just… never appealed to me. It smells awful, too.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you been exposed to any irritants at work or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Uh… at work… yeah, sometimes. I work at the water treatment plant, right? So there are chemicals… we have to handle them. We have… masks, and stuff. But sometimes you can still smell them, you know? I try to be careful, but… it's part of the job. Other than that… not really. I don't do much besides work and hang out with my wife and son.
DOCTOR: Okay, chemical exposure at work is a factor we should consider. Now, let's talk about any other symptoms. Have you noticed any chest pain, coughing, fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Maybe a little… tightness sometimes, but it’s not sharp or anything. Coughing… yeah, a little. Mostly just when I lie down, I think. Not a bad cough, just… dry. No fever or chills. And I haven’t lost any weight… if anything, I’ve been eating more lately. My wife keeps complaining about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a few questions about your medical history generally. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uhh… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty careful about what I eat. My wife is always telling me not to try new things. She worries about me. No, no allergies. I'm pretty sure. Sorry, I wish I was more helpful with all this. My memory is just… awful.
DOCTOR: You are doing just fine, Marquie. It's alright if you don’t remember everything. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them half the time. She gets annoyed. No, no medications. Just… hope, I guess. And a good wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marquie. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and just get a general sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to be able to breathe again, you know? Let's get it over with. I… I don't like feeling short of breath.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s a good first step to figure out what's going on. If you could just sit up here for me, please. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Just breathe normally, deeply if you can. Okay… I do hear some wheezing, as you mentioned, especially when you exhale. That’s consistent with some narrowing of the airways. Your breathing sounds a bit labored, and I can hear some faint crackles as well. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds normal. Blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with some airway obstruction and inflammation. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. The X-ray will help us rule out any structural problems, and the pulmonary function test will measure how well your lungs are working. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Uh… X-ray and a test… okay. Sounds… serious. Will it tell me what's wrong? And… will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, so… that's a worry. I… I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Marquie. It’s normal to feel worried when you hear about tests. The tests will help us figure out what’s causing your breathing problems. They don't necessarily mean anything serious, but they’ll give us more information so we can make the right diagnosis and treatment plan. As for the cost, that’s a valid concern. Since you don’t have insurance, we can explore some options to help reduce the expense. The clinic has a financial assistance program for patients without insurance, and we can also see if the hospital offers a discount. I can have our billing department contact you to discuss the costs and payment options. We'll work with you to find a solution that works. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Please. Order the tests. I… I just want to be able to breathe normal again. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please, let's get it over with. And… can you explain to me what the tests involve? I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marquie. I completely understand your nervousness, and I'll explain everything clearly. The chest X-ray is a very simple procedure. You’ll stand in front of a machine, and it will take a quick picture of your lungs. It doesn’t involve any radiation, and it’s completely painless. It usually takes just a few minutes. The pulmonary function test is a little more involved, but it’s still not painful. You'll breathe into a tube connected to a machine, and it will measure how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. You'll have to follow some instructions from the technician, like taking deep breaths and blowing out forcefully, but it’s not strenuous. It takes about 15-20 minutes. I'll have our nurse, Sarah, come in and explain the procedures in more detail, and she can answer any questions you have. She’ll also schedule the appointments for you. Is there anything else I can explain to you right now, or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… okay. That doesn’t sound too bad. I… I just hope it shows something we can fix. My wife and son… I need to be able to… you know. Be there. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. And for being understanding. It’s… nice.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marquie. It's my job, and I'm happy to help. And I understand completely. Family is everything. We will do everything we can to get you feeling better so you can be there for them. I’ll have Sarah come in now to schedule your tests. In the meantime, try to relax and take some deep breaths. We’ll get through this together. Sarah, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'll let you know what Sarah says. In the meantime, I'll also have our billing department contact you regarding the financial assistance program and potential discounts. .
