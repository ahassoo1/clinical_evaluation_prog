DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Land sakes, it's been a while since I've been to a doctor. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she's the one who made the appointment. She's worried about… well, about some things that happened to my husband, years ago, and… and I’ve been having a few little spells myself, I suppose. Nothing too serious, I don't think. Just… a little weakness, sometimes. And headaches. My mother had terrible headaches, too. It’s all a bit of a muddle, honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if it feels a bit of a muddle, Ms. Tofani. We’ll take our time and sort through everything. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s helpful to know about your husband's history and your mother’s headaches. Let’s start with you. You mentioned some weakness and headaches. Could you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the weakness… It comes and goes, you see. Mostly on this side… … my left side. It’s not all the time, and it doesn’t last long. Just… feels a bit heavy, like I can’t lift my arm as easily. Sometimes my hand feels a little… clumsy, like I’m dropping things. It’s hard to explain. It just… is. And then it goes away. It’s been happening… oh dear, I don’t know when exactly. A few months, maybe? It's just been getting a little more noticeable lately, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of intermittent weakness on your left side, and a feeling of clumsiness in your hand. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned it's been becoming more noticeable recently. Does anything specific seem to trigger the weakness, or does it happen randomly?
PATIENT: Randomly, I think. Honestly, I can’t recall anything that makes it happen. I just… feel it come on. Sometimes I’m doing something, sometimes I’m just sitting and watching television. It doesn’t seem to matter. It's not like I’ve been doing anything strenuous, you see. I mostly keep busy around the house, little things. Baking, crocheting… nothing that would tire me out. It just… happens. It's a bit unsettling, I suppose, but I try not to worry too much about it. My daughter worries enough for the both of us!
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s good you’re able to stay active. So, no clear triggers for the weakness, it happens both with and without activity. And you mentioned headaches as well. Could you describe those for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… They’re not like a pain pain, if that makes sense. More of a… throbbing feeling. Usually on both sides of my head, but sometimes just on one side. And they can last for hours, sometimes. I just lie down in a dark room with a cool cloth on my forehead. That usually helps, eventually. Like my mother’s headaches, she said. She used to take those little pink pills… I can’t remember the name of them now. They didn’t always work, but they helped take the edge off. I don't take anything for mine, really. Just try to sleep it off. They've been happening… well, on and off for years, I suppose. But maybe they’ve been a little more frequent lately, too? It’s hard to say. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've managed these headaches for quite some time. And it's good you've found some relief with rest. We can certainly discuss medication options if they become more bothersome. You mentioned your mother had similar headaches. Do you know if she ever saw a doctor for them?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother… she didn’t go to the doctor much. Back in her day, you didn't bother the doctor unless it was really bad, you see? She just… suffered through them. She had a lot of children, you know. Always busy. I think she might have seen a specialist once, a long time ago… a neurologist, maybe? But I don’t know what they did or what they said. It was a long time ago, and my father handled all those things. I just remember her lying in her room with the curtains drawn, and my grandmother bringing her cups of tea. And those little pink pills… Now you have me thinking, I should ask my sister if she remembers what they were called. She was always better at remembering things than me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can try to gather more information from your sister later. It’s helpful to know that your mother also experienced headaches. Now, you mentioned your husband had some things happen years ago. Would you be comfortable sharing what those were?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband, bless his soul… It was… a long time ago now. He had… well, he had a weakness, just like me, but much worse. It came on suddenly, one day. He couldn’t move his arm, and his speech was… slurred, like he was talking through mud. We rushed him to the hospital, of course. They said it was a… a stroke, I think. Or maybe a TIA? I don’t really remember all the medical terms. He recovered, mostly. He had to go to physical therapy for a long time, to learn to walk and talk again. He was always a strong man, but it took a toll on him. It happened… oh dear, I think it was in the early nineties. He lived a good long life after that, but he never quite got back to his old self. It’s frightening, you see. Seeing someone you love suddenly… changed. That’s why my daughter is so worried, I think. She remembers it so well.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Tofani. That must have been a very frightening experience for you and your family. It’s good your daughter is being proactive, and it’s helpful for me to have this information. Just to clarify, do you recall if your husband had any risk factors for stroke, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking things I haven't thought about in years. He was a smoker, you see. Always had a cigarette dangling from his lip. And he loved his red meat. Steak, chops… he wasn’t one for vegetables, that’s for sure. As for blood pressure… I think he had it checked once or twice, but I don't remember the doctor saying anything was wrong. He wasn't one for doctors, either. Just tough it out, that was his motto. He was a strong man, but sometimes… sometimes I wish he had taken better care of himself. My daughter used to nag him, you know. She always worried about his health. Now she’s the worrier.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Tofani. It’s helpful to have a clearer picture of his health history. Now, let’s turn our attention back to you. You mentioned you’ve been having some weakness and headaches. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with these, like dizziness, vision changes, difficulty speaking, or numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No dizziness, no. My vision’s been a little blurry lately, but I always thought it was just my eyes getting old. I do need to get a new prescription, I suppose. And sometimes… sometimes my words get stuck. Not all the time, but every now and then I have trouble finding the right word. Like… like trying to catch a butterfly, you see? It’s right there, on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite grasp it. It doesn’t happen often, and it doesn't last long. Just a little frustrating, that’s all. Nothing to write home about, really. And no numbness or tingling, no. Just the weakness and the headaches, and sometimes the blurry vision and the trouble with my words. Is that… is that something to be worried about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you’ve shared all of that, Ms. Tofani. And it's perfectly alright to be concerned, especially given your husband's history. Those symptoms – the weakness, headaches, blurry vision, and difficulty finding words – do warrant further investigation, just to rule out anything serious. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I always told my husband, a good doctor is worth their weight in gold. He was a stubborn man, but he always listened to his doctor. Yes, go ahead with the exam. I’m ready when you are. Just… try not to poke too much!
DOCTOR: I promise to be gentle, Ms. Tofani. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/85. That's a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to check your neurological function. This will involve checking your strength, reflexes, and coordination. I’ll ask you to do a few simple tasks. First, could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, my blood pressure is high, is it? That doesn't surprise me. I do love my salt. Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? I haven't been doing much lifting lately, so I probably am a little weak. It’s mostly just around the house, you see, little things. Crocheting, baking… not exactly strenuous exercise. But I do try to stay busy, you know? Can't sit still for too long. Gets me into trouble, my daughter says.
DOCTOR: That’s good strength, Ms. Tofani, a little less than maximal, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and I’ll move your arms and legs. I’m just checking your range of motion and looking for any weakness or stiffness. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Now, finally, I'd like you to touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger. We’ll do that with each hand. Okay, very good. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. However, I did note a little bit of clumsiness on the left side when I asked you to touch your nose with your finger, and some reduced grip strength bilaterally. Now, I'd like to order some blood work and a brain scan, just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Clumsiness, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? I have been dropping things more lately, now that you mention it. And my daughter has been saying I seem a little… off balance. I just thought it was my age, you see. Blood work and a scan… well, if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then go ahead. I trust your judgment. I don't like the sound of scans, but if it will help figure out what's going on, then I’m willing. Just… try not to find anything too terrible, alright? Will the scan take long? And will it hurt? I don't do well with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It's good you’ve shared that with me, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned. The scan will help us rule out any serious causes for your symptoms. We'll start with the blood work. It’s just a simple draw, and it will give us information about your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or deficiencies. As for the scan, we’ll do an MRI of your brain. It’s a very safe procedure, and it doesn't involve any radiation. You'll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. It’s a little noisy, but you’ll be given earplugs. It doesn't hurt, but you need to lie very still during the scan. Regarding needles, the blood draw will be the only needle involved. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle, and we can use a numbing cream if you’re particularly anxious. I’ll order the tests now, and the receptionist will schedule you for the scan as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid driving and operating heavy machinery, just to be on the safe side. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot. But alright, Doctor. If it will help, I’ll do it. No driving, you say? Good. My daughter’s been trying to get me to give up driving for years. She says I’m too old. She’s probably right, to be honest. And the scan… 30-45 minutes, you say? Alright. I can lie still for that long, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And the earplugs are good. I hate loud noises. And the blood work… yes, alright. Be gentle, you said? That's good. I do faint easily, you see. So, the receptionist will schedule everything? Alright. Just… let me know when, and I’ll be there. I trust you, Doctor. You seem very competent. Is there anything else I need to do? Or think about? Or… should I tell my daughter about all this? She worries so much.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Tofani. And yes, the receptionist will schedule everything for you. She’ll also give you some instructions on how to prepare for the scan. As for your daughter, I recommend you do tell her. She’s clearly very supportive, and it’s important to have someone with you during the scan, just for moral support and to help with transportation. You don’t need to go into every detail if you don’t want to, but letting her know what’s going on is a good idea. For now, just try to relax and focus on taking care of yourself. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe headache, weakness, difficulty speaking, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ve written down some clear instructions for you, including the emergency contact information. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s a good idea about my daughter. She’ll want to know everything, bless her heart. And thank you for writing down the instructions. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Let me see… questions… Hmm. Will the scan show everything? Like, if there’s something… serious? I don’t want to think about it, but… is it possible there’s something really bad going on? And… will it be expensive? I have insurance, but… medical bills can be so confusing. Oh dear, I'm rambling, aren't I? It's just… it's a lot to take in. And… one more thing. Will I be able to eat before the scan? I always get hungry.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Tofani. It's completely normal to be anxious and worried. And no, you're not rambling at all. The MRI is a very powerful imaging tool, and it will show us a lot of detail about your brain. It will help us rule out things like stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormalities. However, it's important to remember that a scan is just one piece of the puzzle. We'll also consider your symptoms, your medical history, and the results of your blood work. Regarding cost, that's a valid concern. The cost of the scan will depend on your insurance coverage and the specific facility. The receptionist can provide you with an estimate and help you navigate the billing process. We also have a financial counselor who can assist you if you have any concerns about the cost. And yes, you can eat before the scan. In fact, it's a good idea to eat a light meal, as it will help you relax. Just avoid any caffeinated beverages or sugary snacks. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. The receptionist is right over there, and she’ll be happy to help you. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and develop a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind and patient with me. I suppose I should go talk to the receptionist then. She’s right over there, you said? Alright. Well, thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little bit better, knowing that we’re getting this sorted out. I think that’s all for now. Unless… oh dear, I can't remember what I was going to ask… Never mind. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry about forgetting what you were going to ask. It happens to the best of us. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this together.
