DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… I don’t know why. It’s been going on a while, I think. Honestly, dates… they all sort of blend together these days. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Draining, you say. Yes, I understand. It's not uncommon to feel that way. “A while” is rather vague, unfortunately. Could you perhaps narrow that down for me?
PATIENT: Narrow it down… hmm. After… after my husband, I think. He… he passed three years ago, maybe? Four? It’s definitely been longer than a year, that I’m sure of. It just… got worse and worse after that. It’s hard to say exactly when it became… this.
DOCTOR: I see. Three or four years ago, following the passing of your husband. That is… a significant life event. And you've noticed the fatigue gradually worsening since then. Has this fatigue been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I think. Or… mostly. Some days are… less bad. I can get things done, you know? Grocery shopping, a little bit of cleaning. But then… then I just crash. It feels like… like all my energy just… vanishes. It's not like a normal tired, Doctor. It's… deeper.
DOCTOR: “Deeper” is a useful descriptor, thank you. And these crashes… how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Days, usually. A couple of days where I really can't do much of anything. Sometimes… sometimes it’s a week. It’s hard to say, really. I mostly just… rest until it passes. I try to, anyway.
DOCTOR: A few days to a week of significant fatigue following periods of relative normalcy. And you've found rest to be helpful, although not entirely restorative, I gather?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Rest helps… a little. It doesn't fix it, you know? I wake up still tired. Like I didn’t sleep at all. And it’s not just the tiredness, Doctor. I… sometimes I feel achy all over. Just… generally unwell.
DOCTOR: Achiness, you say. Where specifically are you experiencing this discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. My back, my shoulders… my legs ache sometimes. It’s not… sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like I’ve done too much, but I haven't. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Generalized achiness, not sharp, but persistent. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… Sometimes… I have trouble remembering things. Not big things, but… where I put my keys, or… what I was going to say. It’s embarrassing. And… I feel cold a lot. Even when it’s warm.
DOCTOR: Memory difficulties and feeling cold frequently. These are… pertinent observations, Ms. Licano. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Not that I know of. I had… high blood pressure, a few years back. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… strange. I haven't been to a doctor regularly since… well, since my husband passed, I suppose.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, medication discontinued due to side effects, and limited recent medical care. I see. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Just… a few bad colds over the years. Nothing serious. I’m usually… pretty healthy, you know? Or… I was.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly. She was always in pain. And my father… he had heart trouble. He passed away when I was young, though. It’s all a bit… fuzzy now, to be honest. I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father. Alright. Now, Ms. Licano, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. My husband… he didn't approve. And I wouldn’t. I just… I don't do any of that. I drink tea, sometimes. And I like to read. Mostly.
DOCTOR: No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take a pain reliever for my aches. Ibuprofen, I think? When they get really bad. But not every day. It doesn't really help much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Intermittent ibuprofen use for aches. Alright, Ms. Licano. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just… I’d like to get to the bottom of this. I’m tired of being tired.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let's begin. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your thyroid. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but shouldn’t be painful. Your heart rate is a little slow, 62 beats per minute, and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 118 over 76. Thyroid is slightly enlarged, and there is some mild tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. All right. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out a number of potential causes for your symptoms, including thyroid issues, anemia, and vitamin deficiencies. I also want to check your kidney and liver function.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… that sounds… serious. What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Licano. We need to gather information to determine the cause of your fatigue and other symptoms. The blood work will help us rule out several possibilities, such as hypothyroidism, which can cause fatigue, weight gain, and feeling cold, as well as anemia, which can cause fatigue and weakness. We'll also check your vitamin levels, as deficiencies can also cause similar symptoms. It’s a rather comprehensive panel, but it’s the most efficient way to proceed. We need to have a baseline before we consider more invasive tests.
PATIENT: Hypo… what? And… what did you say about invasive tests? I don’t want any… any poking and prodding, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is it serious, what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid gland isn't producing enough thyroid hormone. It's relatively common, and often treatable with medication. As for invasive tests, I was simply outlining the potential next steps if the blood work is inconclusive. We will start with the blood work and discuss further options only if necessary. It is, of course, impossible to say whether your condition is “serious” at this stage. That’s precisely why we are conducting these tests. It's best not to jump to conclusions. I assure you, we will proceed cautiously and methodically. Do you have any further questions before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: The blood work should take approximately three to five business days to process. As for the needle, it will be a brief, sharp pinch. Most patients tolerate it well. The phlebotomist is very experienced, and will minimize any discomfort. After we receive the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, getting adequate rest, and avoiding any strenuous activity. It's unlikely to be a quick fix, Ms. Licano, but we will work together to improve your quality of life. Now, let’s get you over to the lab.
PATIENT: Okay. I… I guess so. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. The phlebotomist is expecting you. Let me know if you experience any discomfort after the blood draw.
