DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. Seems my blood pressure’s been a little high, the lady at the pharmacy said I oughta get it checked proper. Don’t rightly know much about it, but I figured it best to be safe.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. It's good to meet you as well. It's always wise to be proactive about your health. High blood pressure is quite common, and we can certainly take a look at it today. To start, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this might be an issue, or when the pharmacy mentioned it?
PATIENT: Well, now… let me think. It was probably… oh, a couple months ago, maybe? I was at old Man Tiber’s store, and he had one of them machines folks can use. Just for fun, ya know? And it said a number… a kinda high number. Didn’t think much of it then, figured it was just the machine bein’ wonky. Then the nice lady at the pharmacy checked it when I was gettin’ my medicine, and she said I really oughta see a doctor. That’s when I called.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you followed up with the pharmacy lady’s recommendation. Sometimes those machines can be unreliable, but it’s always best to check things out. Do you happen to remember what that number was at Tiber's store, even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Land sakes, no. My memory ain’t what it used to be. It was… red, I think? On the screen? Numbers and red. That's all I rightly recall. I was thinkin’ more about gettin’ my biscuit recipe just right for the county fair, to be honest. Old Man Tiber makes a mean peach cobbler, ya see, and I gotta beat him this year!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Venna! A little friendly competition is good for the soul. Don’t worry about the exact number from the store; we’ll get an accurate reading here today. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder taken out years and years ago. Musta been… forty years, maybe more? And I got arthritis in my hands, makes bakin’ a little harder sometimes. But other than that… nothin’ much. I've been pretty lucky, I reckon. Been eatin' good food and livin' a simple life.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Venna. It sounds like you've lived a full life. Having your gallbladder removed and arthritis are helpful things to know. And do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just somethin’ for the arthritis, a little pill. Can’t recall the name of it, the doctor back home always just sent it to the pharmacy. And no, no allergies that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We can certainly look up what you’re taking for the arthritis in your records. Do you mind if I take a look?
PATIENT: No, go right ahead. Wouldn't mind at all. Long as it helps figure things out.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see here you're taking Naproxen for your arthritis, which is a common anti-inflammatory medication. Now, let's get a current reading of your blood pressure and check your pulse. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds just fine, Doctor. Get to checkin’ whatever ya need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, reading 162 over 98. Your pulse is 78, which is within a normal range. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Elevated, huh? What’s… what’s too high? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Venna. A normal blood pressure is generally considered to be around 120/80. Yours is a bit higher than that, and consistently high blood pressure can lead to some health problems down the road, like heart disease or stroke. That’s why we want to take a look at it and see what’s going on. Before we get too worried, though, it’s important to remember that blood pressure can fluctuate, and one reading doesn’t tell the whole story. We'll need to look at a few more factors. Let me listen to your heart and lungs, and then we can discuss some possible causes and what we can do about it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, I reckon so. Whatever ya think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna. Your breathing sounds a little congested, and I’m hearing a slight murmur. It’s often harmless, but it’s something to note. Now, have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or headaches lately?
PATIENT: Well… my chest has been feelin’ a little tight lately, now that ya mention it. Not bad enough to stop me bakin’, but… a little tighter than usual. And I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. But I just figured I was gettin’ old!
DOCTOR: It's good you’re telling me, Venna. Those symptoms – the chest tightness and dizziness – could be related to the elevated blood pressure, or something else entirely. We need to investigate further. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Land sakes, that's a long story. My mama, she had a weak heart. Died young, back in '68. And my daddy, he had somethin’ with his blood sugar, I think. Kept him real tired all the time. Lots of folks on my side of the family, they just… didn’t live long.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Venna. Knowing your family history is very helpful. It sounds like there might be a genetic predisposition to heart problems and diabetes. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Like I said before, I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction. I've always been a pretty tough old bird, ya see.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone, but I keep busy. I bake, of course. And I garden some. I mostly try to stay inside and keep cool since it gets hot out here. I don't smoke or drink. And I try to get a little walk in when the weather's nice.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you stay active, Venna. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Just a little tabby cat named Biscuit. He's a good boy. Keeps me company. And he loves my cookies.
DOCTOR: That's lovely. Companionship is very important. Now, Venna, based on everything you’ve told me – the elevated blood pressure, the chest tightness, the dizziness, your family history, and your current symptoms – I think we need to do a few more tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Lord. Sounds like a lot. But if ya think it's best, Doctor, I reckon I'll do 'em. Just get to the bottom of things, ya know? I don't want nothin' serious sneakin' up on me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. It’s always best to be thorough. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood and get the orders in for the EKG and chest X-ray. We can schedule those for later today or tomorrow, whichever works best for you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of a blood pressure medication, Lisinopril, to start controlling your blood pressure. It’s a common medication, and it usually has very few side effects. We’ll monitor your blood pressure closely and adjust the dosage as needed. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Alright, sounds… alright. As long as it helps. I just want to feel like myself again. I got biscuits to bake and a fair to win, ya know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. We’ll do everything we can to get you back to baking biscuits and winning fairs! I’ll also give you a handout with information about Lisinopril, including potential side effects and important precautions. Here are a few things I want you to keep in mind while you're taking Lisinopril. First, make sure to drink plenty of fluids, especially in hot weather. Second, avoid getting up too quickly from a sitting or lying position, as this can cause dizziness. And third, if you experience any swelling of your face, lips, or tongue, or if you have trouble breathing, seek medical attention immediately. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check your blood pressure and review the results of your tests. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds fine. Just keep me bakin' biscuits, ya know? I'll try to remember all that... drinkin' and not gettin' up fast. It's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. That’s the goal! And don’t worry about remembering everything; we’re here to help you every step of the way. Sarah will go over everything again with you before you leave, and you can always call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now before Sarah comes in?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that's all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listenin' and tryin' to help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. We'll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better in no time. I’ll let Sarah know you’re ready, and she’ll be in shortly. Take care, and remember to stay hydrated!
