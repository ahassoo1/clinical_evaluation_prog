DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My… someone told me I needed to come. Something about not being able to… see and hear properly? It’s all rather inconvenient, if you must know. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It can be a little unsettling when you’re not quite sure what’s going on, or why you’re even here. It sounds like someone – perhaps a family member or another doctor – recommended you come in for an evaluation of your vision and hearing. Is that right?
PATIENT: Possibly. My daughter, perhaps. She fusses over everything. Honestly, I barely noticed anything was… off. A little blurry sometimes, I suppose. And things seeming a bit quiet. But I’ve always had excellent senses. I was a surgeon, you know. Pediatric, actually. One needs to be precise. It’s probably nothing. Just… get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you were a surgeon – that does require incredible precision, and it's common for those with sharp senses to not notice gradual changes. We'll do a quick assessment, just to be sure everything's as it should be. Let's start with your vision. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to see at different distances – like trouble reading, driving, or seeing things far away?
PATIENT: Driving? Good heavens, no. I haven’t driven in… years. Far too much bother. Reading is… fine. I have rather strong reading glasses, always have. It’s not as though I spend all my time poring over novels. Mostly just… important documents. And things are just… a little dimmer, perhaps? I don't know. Really, Doctor, I expect this is a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Okay, dimmer vision and needing reading glasses. And you haven't noticed any trouble with distance vision. That's helpful. Now, about the hearing. You mentioned things seeming a little quiet. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, people mumble, don’t they? Always have. Dreadfully inconsiderate. And the television… my daughter insists on having it at a volume that is simply barbaric. Perhaps they should speak louder, and turn down that infernal box. It’s not my ears that are the problem, I assure you. I always heard perfectly well during operations. One must hear the beeping, you know. Crucial.
DOCTOR: Right, so people mumbling and the television being too loud. And you were able to hear the beeping sounds clearly during surgery. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Really? Must we? I was a surgeon, Doctor. I gave medical histories. I didn’t have them. Perfectly healthy, as far as I’m concerned. Though, I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago. But that was… ages ago. And my divorce, of course. A terribly draining experience. Does that count? It certainly affected my well-being. Honestly, I haven’t the time for a lengthy recitation of ailments. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Burdette. It's just helpful for me to have a complete picture. The flu is good to know, and I do appreciate you mentioning that. While a divorce isn’t a medical condition, I understand it can affect your overall health, and thank you for sharing. Let’s just quickly cover some basics. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Absolutely not! I was a surgeon! We are screened constantly. Meticulously. I assure you, my health was impeccable. I eat a balanced diet, though my daughter fusses over that as well – too much red meat, not enough… kale, or whatever it is. The point is, I am perfectly healthy. I find this line of questioning rather… insulting, frankly. Do you often interrogate your patients like this?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Burdette. It’s standard practice to gather this information, even for very healthy individuals. It helps rule out potential contributing factors. Okay. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any surgeries yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must we dredge up every single detail of my life? Yes, I’ve had surgeries. I was a surgeon. Naturally, I’ve undergone procedures. Appendectomy, years ago. Nothing serious. And… a rather unfortunate incident with a fall a few years back. A broken wrist, if I recall correctly. But it healed perfectly, thank you very much. My daughter insisted on the best specialist, of course. Always the best. Is that sufficient? Can we please move on? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and a broken wrist. Thank you. That’s very helpful. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or vision or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, I barely speak to my family. My mother was… difficult. And my brother… well, he was always rather preoccupied with himself. I couldn't possibly tell you what ailments plagued them. It's all rather… irrelevant. They weren’t known for their robust health, I suppose. But I certainly didn't inherit any of their weaknesses. I was always the strong one. Can we please conclude this examination? I'm wasting valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Burdette. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you sharing what you’re comfortable with. Now, let's just quickly go over allergies and current medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
