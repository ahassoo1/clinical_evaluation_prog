DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. It’s been acting up. A lot. Like, a lot of… you know… diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while, and it's just really tiring. I can’t really remember when it started, exactly, but it feels like months.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea for months is definitely tiring, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say “a lot,” can you give me an estimate of how many times a day you’re experiencing this?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s a good question. It varies, really. Some days it’s like… five or six times. Other days… honestly, I lose count. Maybe eight? More? It’s pretty much constant, to be fair. It’s not like, a few times a day. It’s… frequent. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at numbers. It just… happens a lot.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Jase. Frequent is a good enough description. It sounds very disruptive. And is it watery diarrhea, or is there any form to it?
PATIENT: Um… mostly watery. Like, really watery. Sometimes there’s… bits in it, but not always. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not solid, definitely not. More like… liquid, most of the time. It’s just… unpleasant. Sorry. I don't really like talking about this.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize at all, Jase. This is what I’m here for, and it’s important to discuss these things, even if they're uncomfortable. Okay, watery diarrhea, sometimes with bits. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood… I don’t think so. Maybe once or twice, but I wasn’t sure. It could have been something else. And mucus… yeah, sometimes. Like, a little bit. Not a lot, but definitely sometimes there’s some… sliminess. It's hard to tell, honestly. It all looks the same after a while, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to tell. Okay, blood possibly once or twice, and mucus sometimes. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain, yeah, definitely. It’s like… cramping, mostly. Not all the time, but when it happens it's pretty bad. Not like, emergency room bad, but uncomfortable. Nausea sometimes, but I haven’t actually vomited. And no fever, I don't think. I haven't checked, to be honest. I just feel tired a lot, does that count?
DOCTOR: It definitely counts, Jase. Fatigue is a very common symptom with these types of issues. Okay, so cramping abdominal pain, no vomiting, no fever, and fatigue along with the frequent watery diarrhea with occasional mucus. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I haven’t been less hungry, but I just don’t feel like eating much. It's not that I don't want to, it's just… I don't have the energy to cook, and when my stomach is upset I definitely don’t want to eat. So I’ve been eating less, I guess. Mostly just small things, if anything. Like toast or crackers. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Okay, eating less, mostly bland foods when you do eat. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who has been sick?
PATIENT: Traveled… No, not really. Just around town, for groceries and stuff. And no, I don’t think anyone I’ve been around has been sick. My husband was a little sniffly last week, but he just had a cold. Nothing major. I haven't been around anyone with… food poisoning or anything, if that’s what you mean. Honestly, I mostly just go to work and come home. It’s pretty boring.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent travel or known exposure to illness. And just to get a full picture, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I take a daily vitamin, that’s it. And no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband gets hay fever, but that's him. I'm pretty healthy, usually. Except for… you know. This.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily vitamin, no known allergies. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Um… that's a bit of a tricky question. My doctor… a few years ago, she said something about my stomach. I think she mentioned something about… IBD? Or maybe it was IBS? Honestly, I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and I was stressed about a lot of things then. She gave me some medicine, but it didn't really help, so I just… stopped taking it. I don't even remember what the medicine was for. Sorry, I'm really bad with this stuff. My memory isn't the best.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all, Jase. It's common to forget details, especially if it was a while ago and the medication didn't help. So, you were previously evaluated for a possible inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries at all. I've been lucky, I guess. I've never really needed anything major, until… well, now. It's just… frustrating. It feels like my body is just… broken.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And finally, is there any family history of gastrointestinal problems, like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Um... My grandma, on my dad's side, she had some stomach problems when she was older. She was always complaining about it. I think she had something… autoimmune? But I don't really know what. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. My mom's side… not really. They're all pretty healthy, I think. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My family doesn't really share a lot of medical information.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible gastrointestinal issues in your grandmother. That's helpful to know. Alright, Jase, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds fine. I guess. I mean, I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but if it will help, then yeah. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm checking for any tenderness or distention. Okay, your abdomen is a little tender to the touch in your lower left quadrant, and I'm hearing some increased bowel sounds. This is consistent with what you’ve described. I don't feel any masses or anything concerning. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some stool tests. These tests can help us rule out any infections or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ouch, yeah, that’s… a little sore. Stool tests? Um… okay. I guess so. It doesn’t sound very pleasant, but if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yeah. I’ll do it. Do I have to… collect a lot? And is there anything special I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to collect a large amount, just a small sample. And yes, there are a few things. I’ll give you a collection kit and instructions. It's important to avoid taking any antibiotics or anti-diarrheal medications for a few days before the test, as they can interfere with the results. Also, please collect the sample in the provided container and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. The nurse will give you instructions on where to drop it off. Given your previous evaluation for possible IBD and the chronicity of your symptoms, I'm also going to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation. We’ll also check your vitamin levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… a lot of tests. No antibiotics, and don’t take anything for my stomach… got it. Blood tests too… Yeah, okay. If it will help, then yeah. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better. Will the tests take a long time? And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s a lot, Jase, but it’s best to be thorough. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results, so I expect we'll have them back within a week. I’ll call you as soon as they're available to discuss them and go over the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on staying hydrated with clear fluids like water and electrolyte solutions. You can also continue eating bland, easily digestible foods. And if your symptoms worsen significantly—like if you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything pretty well. Just… a week? That feels like a long time to wait. But I guess I have to. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I really appreciate it. I just want to get back to normal, you know? I think that's it. .
