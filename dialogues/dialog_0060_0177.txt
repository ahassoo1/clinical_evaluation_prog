DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Genard. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it’s…down there. Something’s leaking. Not good, you know? Makes a mess. I don't know why it's leaking though. Old age, probably. Everything’s falling apart, isn't it?
DOCTOR: "Down there," hmm?
PATIENT: Don't you doctors have a name for everything? It’s…it’s coming from him. You know. The fella. And it smells funny. Not like flowers, I can tell you that much. It's been going on…a little while now. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. We do have names for things. It sounds like you’re experiencing some incontinence, Ms. Genard – leakage of urine. And you're right to bring it to my attention if it's getting worse. Could you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: In…what now? Look, I just told you, it leaks. When does it leak? When I move, usually. Or sometimes just…when it wants to. I don't make it leak, if that’s what you're asking. I try to hold it, but sometimes it just…goes. Is that what you want to know? It’s embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. So it seems to be related to movement, and sometimes happens even when you're trying to prevent it. We call that stress incontinence—leakage with physical activity or exertion. Now, has this happened before, or is this a new problem?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. New. Very new. Never had this before. Not like this, anyway. Maybe a little dribble after having a baby…a long, long time ago. But this is…constant-ish. Like a little faucet, dripping away. And it stinks!
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a recent onset, different from anything you experienced after childbirth. And you mentioned an odor… Is it a strong odor?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Very strong. Not like soap, or anything clean. It smells…sour. And kinda fishy, if I'm being honest. My granddaughter told me once fish goes bad and smells like that. I haven’t been eating much fish lately, so I know it ain't that. It just…smells bad. Makes me not want to leave the house, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds unpleasant. The odor you're describing is concerning, Ms. Genard. It could indicate an infection. Have you noticed any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? Hmm…not really burning. More like…a little pinch. Sometimes. Not every time. It's hard to say. Everything down there just feels…sensitive. Like it's all irritated. Like a sunburn, maybe, but not red. Does that make sense? And I’ve been feeling a little tired lately, too. But I'm old, so…
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Sensitivity and a mild pinching sensation are worth noting. Fatigue could be related to several things, we'll keep that in mind. Okay, Ms. Genard, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, dear. Do you have to…look at it? I’m a modest woman, you know. And what will you do? I don’t like poking and prodding. Will it hurt? I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Genard. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Yes, I will need to briefly examine the area, but we'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll explain everything before I do it, and you can tell me to stop at any time. It shouldn't be painful, but you might feel some mild pressure. We’ll start with a general abdominal exam and then, if you’re comfortable, a quick look at the external area. It's important to rule out any skin irritation or signs of infection. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But hurry, alright? And don’t you go poking around too much. And please, explain everything before you do it. I don’t like surprises. And a chaperone? Do you have a nurse I can have in here with me? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. That’s a very reasonable request. I will certainly have a nurse present during the exam. One moment while I let her know to come in. And I promise, I'll explain each step before I do it. I’ll start with a general check of your abdomen – just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Then, if you're comfortable, we'll take a look at the external area. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. But be gentle, alright? And don’t you go laughing or anything. This is very embarrassing for me, you know. Old ladies don’t want to be poked and prodded!
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I completely understand. We'll be as respectful and gentle as possible. It’s perfectly normal to feel embarrassed, and I assure you, neither I nor the nurse will laugh. We’re here to help you feel better. Now, if you could lie back on the exam table when you're ready, we can begin. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It won’t be cold. Is that alright?
