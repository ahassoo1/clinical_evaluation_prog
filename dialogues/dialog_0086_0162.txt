DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really do mornings, but whatever. It's my stomach, I guess. Bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. Honestly, I haven’t got all day to sit here describing… feelings. Just, it's uncomfortable. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable is a start. But to help me figure out why you feel uncomfortable, I need a little more than that, I'm afraid. When did this bloating start?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? When did it start? I don’t… I don’t know. A while ago. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Look, I work, alright? Pile driving. Not exactly a job where you sit around cataloging your… internal rhythms. It's just been happening more lately, that's all I know. Is there a quick fix or what?
DOCTOR: Right. Pile driving. That does explain a certain level of… robustness. A few weeks, coming and going… okay. And is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Everything makes it worse! Eating makes it worse. Not eating makes it worse. Sitting makes it worse. Standing makes it worse. Honestly, it's just… there. Look, I ate a sandwich yesterday, a normal sandwich, and felt like I was going to explode. Doesn't mean anything's wrong with the sandwich, probably just… sandwiches are bad. I don't need a lecture on my diet, Doc.
DOCTOR: No lectures, I assure you. Though, a normal sandwich is… surprisingly vague. What was in this sandwich, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Bread, meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato. You know, a sandwich. I'm not a chef, alright? It wasn't fancy. Look, I'm a practical man. I need to know if I've got something seriously wrong, or if I just need to avoid sandwiches. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to be a little more systematic. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… I'm not coughing up blood or anything. I'm just bloated. Maybe a little… gassy. Is that a symptom? Honestly, Doc, if you need a detailed list of every burp I've had in the last three weeks, you've got the wrong patient. I’m a construction worker, not a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood, no fever. Just bloating and some gas. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Look, are you trying to embarrass me? Seriously? What kind of question is that? Yes, okay, things are… different. A little looser, sometimes. Sometimes… not so much. Is that what you wanted to hear? I told you, I don’t have time for this. Just tell me if I need surgery, or if I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand you're busy, but I need to gather information to determine what's going on. Changes in bowel habits are important. Has there been any blood in your stool, even a small amount?
PATIENT: Look, I already said no. No blood. Are you deliberately trying to be difficult? I'm a grown man, I know what blood looks like. I haven’t seen any. This is ridiculous. My wife… my late wife… she'd never put up with this. Just… are you going to do something, or am I wasting my time? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright. I apologize if my questions seem… intrusive. It’s just that changes in bowel habits, along with bloating and gas, can have several causes. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Look, I haven't been trying to lose weight. I eat when I can. Work's been… rough. Maybe I haven't been eating as much. I don’t know! I don’t weigh myself every day, alright? I’m a pile driver operator, not a model. Honestly, this is getting me nowhere. .
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your appetite?
