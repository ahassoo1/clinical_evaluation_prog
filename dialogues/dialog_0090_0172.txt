DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s all rather…procedural, isn’t it? My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare wants us to establish care…something about forms. I haven’t a clue what they need from me, and frankly, I haven’t much time for this.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, establishing care is important, and Medicare does have their requirements. It's a standard process to ensure we have a good understanding of your overall health. It doesn’t have to be a lengthy ordeal, but we do need to cover some basics. Let's start with why you decided to seek care today, regardless of the paperwork. Are you experiencing any particular symptoms or health concerns?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Really. At my age, Doctor, everything is a symptom of something. Honestly, I feel…old. Is that a medical complaint? I get tired easily, and my knees ache when it rains. Though, to be fair, everyone’s knees ache when it rains. It’s the humidity, I suspect. I don’t require a diagnosis for simply existing, do I?
DOCTOR: No, of course not. But “feeling old” and achy knees can be indicators of underlying issues we should investigate. It's my job to determine if there's something more going on than just the natural effects of aging and the weather. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did you start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics… Honestly, Doctor, time is rather…blurry these days. A few months, perhaps? It’s hard to say. My husband does most of the remembering, and he wasn’t particularly concerned. He said I was always a bit of a napper. Which is…rude, frankly. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few months, that’s…helpful, in a general sense. And I understand you have a luncheon. We’ll try to be efficient. Has this fatigue been interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfering? Well, I don’t bounce around as much as I used to, if that’s what you mean. I used to be quite the gardener, but…the bending. It’s not comfortable. And I find myself…resting more. Though, a lady is allowed to rest, isn't she? I’m not running a marathon, Doctor. I simply want to be left alone to enjoy my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, a lady is allowed to rest. I’m simply trying to understand the extent of this fatigue. So, you’ve reduced your gardening due to discomfort…are there any other activities you’ve had to cut back on?
PATIENT: Cut back on…? Honestly, Doctor, I mostly read and supervise the household staff. I haven’t “cut back” on anything significant. My husband handles the…errands. And the finances, thankfully. I wouldn't dream of attempting that. It’s all rather…organized, you see. I'm not one for exertion. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly capable, despite my age. It’s just…a bit tiring sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to other potential symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite. Well, I’ve always been…particular. I don't eat much red meat. And I prefer my vegetables steamed, not boiled. My weight? Honestly, I haven't stepped on a scale in decades. It's terribly vulgar, don't you think? My husband assures me I'm…comfortable. Which is all that matters, really. I simply want to be left to my own devices. This is quite tedious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. Just a few more questions, and then we can proceed with a quick physical exam, if you’re willing. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Good heavens, no. I haven't swooned or anything dramatic like that. I get a little…winded climbing the stairs, perhaps, but that’s hardly a crisis. It’s a very long staircase, you see. And I don't particularly enjoy climbing stairs. I prefer the lift, naturally. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly…functional. This is all rather unnecessary. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. A rather important luncheon. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. Since you feel functional and are not experiencing any acute symptoms, we can proceed with a basic examination. It will just be a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a check of your reflexes. If anything concerning arises, we can discuss further testing. But for now, let’s just get a baseline. Do you have any allergies to medications?
