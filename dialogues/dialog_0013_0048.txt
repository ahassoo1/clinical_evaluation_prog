DOCTOR: Hi Colt, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my head, mostly. My wife, she’s been saying I’ve been… not myself lately. Forgetting things, getting turned around. It’s just little things, mostly, but she worries. Honestly, I think she makes too much of it. Still, she insisted I come.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good of her to encourage you to get it checked out. It's always best to rule things out. “Little things” can sometimes add up to something important, so I'm glad you're here. So, when did you first start noticing these… forgetful moments or feeling turned around?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now, let me think… It’s been… oh, maybe six months or so? It started gradually. At first, I just misplaced my tools more often. A wrench here, a tile cutter there. Nothing a good search wouldn't find. But then it became… harder to remember where I’d put them. And then… well, sometimes I look at a room I’ve worked in for years and… it just doesn’t feel right. Like I’m seeing it for the first time. Not often, mind you. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months is a good timeframe to start with. And it sounds like it’s been a gradual progression, which is helpful to know. The feeling of unfamiliarity with a familiar space is definitely something we want to explore further. You mentioned tools – are you still able to use them without difficulty when you find them?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. My hands haven't forgotten anything. Been setting tile since I was a boy, you know? I can still lay a floor as straight as any young man. It’s not doing the work, it’s remembering where I left the darn things and… sometimes… remembering the order of things. Like, I’ll start a pattern and then… I’ll pause, and it’s just… gone. I have to think it through again. It takes a bit longer. My wife says I’m slower, but she doesn’t understand. A man needs his time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds incredibly frustrating to have your mental process feel a little… off, even if the physical skill is still there. And it’s good you’re able to articulate that difference. Let’s talk about other things going on. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, like feeling more anxious or depressed than usual?
PATIENT: Anxious? Depressed? No, no. I’m a practical man. I don’t have time for feelings. I get irritated, of course. Especially when I can’t find my tools, or when people ask silly questions. My wife… she worries too much, and that irritates me. But I wouldn’t say I’m depressed. Just… annoyed. A lot. And tired, I suppose. Setting tile is hard work, even for a young man.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Irritability and fatigue – those can definitely be symptoms of a lot of things. We'll keep those in mind. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, it’s not as sound as it used to be. I wake up a few times a night. Just… little things. A noise, a feeling… I don’t know. I get up, go to the bathroom, then go back to bed. Not a big deal. My wife says I toss and turn, but she always exaggerates. I’ve always been a light sleeper. It comes with being a careful man, you know? Always listening, always aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent sleep disturbance. It's good you're able to fall back asleep, but we'll note that pattern. Let’s switch gears a bit. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes there. I eat what my wife cooks, and I haven’t lost or gained any weight. She keeps me well-fed, that woman. Always has. She worries if I don’t eat enough. Likes to see a good plate cleaned. She makes good Khmer food, you know. Though sometimes I miss the French bread from when we lived in the city. But that’s just an old man’s craving.
DOCTOR: That's good, stable appetite and weight. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it's under control. I take a little pill every morning. That’s all. Nothing else. Never been one for getting sick, you know? Strong constitution. And my wife makes sure I take my pills. She's very organized. She keeps a list of everything. I don’t need a list, but she likes having one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension. Good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a roof. Setting tile, of course. Stubborn fool, trying to reach too far. Had it set in a cast. That's it. Nothing else. No hospital stays, except for the appendix and the arm. My wife keeps all the records. She’s very meticulous.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken arm. Both in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks before she cooks something new, just in case. She's very cautious. I eat most things. Especially Khmer food. Though I don’t care much for very spicy peppers. Too much heat. But that’s a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family - things like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a hard one. My mother… she got forgetful towards the end. Very forgetful. My wife says that's probably what this is. But my mother wasn’t a practical woman like me. She spent her time… daydreaming. It’s different. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. Died young. But that was a long time ago. I don’t pay much attention to family history. It doesn’t change how I set tile, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your mother had some memory issues later in life, and your father had heart problems. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I drink… sometimes. A little beer with dinner, on the weekends. Nothing much. My wife doesn’t approve. She says it’s bad for my health. I listen to her, mostly. Keeps me in line, that woman. A small glass, maybe two. On Saturday nights. Keeps me relaxed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional light alcohol use. Do you have any regular hobbies or activities that keep you mentally or physically active?
PATIENT: Well, I set tile, doesn't that count? It keeps me very busy. And I like to fix things around the house. My wife keeps me busy with little projects. Always something needs mending or adjusting. And I read the newspaper, sometimes. Mostly the local news. Keeps me informed. Not much time for hobbies, you know? A man has to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, active with your work and household repairs, and you keep up with the news. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. But I expect a thorough explanation of anything you find. I don't like surprises. And don’t tell me anything I don’t need to know. I'm a practical man, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning given your history. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. And I'm going to check your cranial nerves, just a quick assessment of your memory and balance. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… hmm. August 2nd, 2025. My wife reminded me this morning. We have a family gathering next week, she's been planning it for months. Always planning, that woman. It’s exhausting just thinking about it. But I remember the date. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words… Alright, go ahead. Let's get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Now, I'll ask you to recall those words a little later. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your eyes with a light. Can you follow my pen with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can follow your pen. Don't wave it around too fast, I'm not a young man anymore. And be careful, don't get it too close to my eyes. I need these to set tile, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, your eye movements seem normal. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. There. I can still walk, you see? I haven’t lost my legs yet. Though my knees ache a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, your gait is steady, and your balance appears good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you to recall those three words I asked you earlier. Do you remember them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Three words... Let me think... Apple... and... table... and... something else. It's on the tip of my tongue. Was it... penny? Yes, I think so. Apple, table, penny. I remember. Now, are we finished? I’m starting to feel tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, you recalled all three words correctly. That's good. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam I’ve done, it sounds like you are experiencing some mild cognitive changes, mainly with memory recall. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely something we should investigate further. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s manageable. I'd like to order a few blood tests, just to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other underlying medical conditions. And I’d also like to recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment, possibly with a specialist, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A specialist? Now, hold on a minute. You're saying I'm… losing my mind? I can still set tile, you know? I haven't forgotten how to work. This feels… unnecessary. My wife will be thrilled, of course. Always worrying. But I don’t see the point. Blood tests, alright. But I don’t want any of your fancy specialists poking around in my head.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Colt. I’m not saying you’re losing your mind, absolutely not. What I am saying is that it’s always best to be proactive and investigate any changes in cognitive function, especially as we age. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. The cognitive assessment isn't about "poking around," it's a series of simple tests that can help us identify any areas where you might be experiencing difficulties. This will help us develop a plan to support your cognitive health and maintain your independence. Think of it as a check-up for your brain. There are different types of specialists. We could start with a neurologist, or a geriatrician. I can give you a referral to a specialist that I trust, someone who is very gentle and respectful. It’s ultimately your decision, of course, but I strongly recommend it. In the meantime, let's focus on the blood tests. I’ll write you a requisition now. And I'll also give you a handout with some simple exercises you can do at home to help keep your mind active. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood tests, I can handle. And a handout… I suppose it won’t hurt. But no promises about doing those exercises. I have work to do, you know. Still, I'll look at the handout. And… if it's a gentle specialist, you say? I don't want someone poking and prodding. Just someone who can tell me if my head is still working properly. Give me the name and number. But don't expect me to call right away. I need to think about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Dr. Sharma is very thorough and compassionate. She specializes in geriatric care and has a lot of experience working with patients just like you. She’s known for taking her time and explaining everything in detail. Here’s the requisition for the blood tests. You can get those done at the lab just down the street. They don't require an appointment. And here’s the handout with the exercises. They’re simple things, like puzzles and memory games. No pressure to do them, but they can be helpful. I’ll also send a summary of our conversation to your primary care physician, so they’re aware of what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… don't tell my wife I’m calling the specialist just yet. She’ll get all worked up. She’s already planning my retirement party, even though I have no intention of retiring. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I'll get the blood tests done. And I'll… think about the specialist.
DOCTOR: Of course, Colt. I understand. I won't say anything to your wife. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, at any time. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results of your blood tests. Have a good day.
