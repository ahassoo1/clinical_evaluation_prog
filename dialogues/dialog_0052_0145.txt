DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. The pleasure is all mine. I am here because… well, I need a paper signed, I believe. About getting help at home. My daughter explained it, but I… it's for when someone needs extra care, yes? For when they can’t manage things alone anymore. It’s for… eligibility, she said. Home Health or Hospice. Something like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like you’re seeking assistance with determining eligibility for home healthcare services, potentially including Hospice care. To ensure I complete the necessary documentation accurately, could you tell me a little more about why you and your daughter are considering these services?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. My daughter, she worries, you see. I… I had a fall last month. Not a bad fall, but it shook me up. I am recovering, but things… are not as easy as they used to be. Getting around, mostly. And… remembering things. Though I assure you, Doctor, I remember this conversation perfectly! But other things… small things… they slip my mind. My daughter thinks it would be best to have someone check on me, help with… with the house, maybe. And, if needed, something more. She thinks it's best to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to be proactive about your well-being, and it's good you're both discussing this. A fall can certainly be a turning point, and it's common to experience some changes afterwards. Let's gather a bit more information. You mentioned difficulty with remembering things. Could you describe what that’s like for you?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I forget who people are, or where I live, Doctor. It's more… if I go to the kitchen to get something – a glass of water, perhaps – I sometimes forget why I went there. Or I’ll start a task, like writing a letter, and… I lose my train of thought. Small things. Annoying things. My daughter says I repeat myself sometimes, too. Though I don't recall doing that! It happens mostly at home, I think. When I am not… busy. If I'm concentrating, I seem to be alright.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bahta. Those are important details. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulties with short-term memory and focus, which are more noticeable when you’re less stimulated. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… my mood? Hmm. That's a good question. I suppose I am… a little more easily frustrated than I used to be. Small things bother me. And… I don’t enjoy things as much. I used to love gardening, but… I haven’t felt much motivation lately. Just… not as much enthusiasm, I suppose. It’s not sadness, exactly. Just… less joy. My daughter says I am more… quiet. And she worries about that, naturally.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful information, Mr. Bahta. Reduced motivation and a decrease in enjoyment can be significant indicators. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any known chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I have high blood pressure, Doctor. I've been taking medication for it for… oh, about fifteen years now, I believe. And I had a… a mild heart attack, almost ten years ago. But it was treated quickly, and I recovered well. I see my general practitioner regularly for check-ups and to monitor my blood pressure. He’s Dr. Dubois, in the village. A very good man. He adjusts my medication as needed. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Knowing about your history of hypertension and the prior heart attack is important. And it's good you have a consistent relationship with Dr. Dubois. Have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, of course. And… oh, I had a knee replacement about five years ago. The right one. It went well, but it took some time to recover. It’s… it's still a little stiff sometimes, especially in cold weather. And… I think that’s it. Nothing else major that I recall.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any family members who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she had some problems with her memory towards the end of her life. My daughter always said it was just old age, but… she did forget things a lot. And she became… confused, sometimes. She wasn’t diagnosed with anything, though. We lived in France then, and… things were different. My father… he was always very sharp, right up until the end. No memory problems that I recall. And my siblings… they seem fine. But we don’t see each other very often. So it’s difficult to say, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. That's understandable. A family history of memory issues, even without a specific diagnosis, is useful information. Finally, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not live alone. My daughter, Isabelle, she moved in with me about six months ago. After my fall, she insisted. She works from home, so it’s convenient. She handles most of the housework now, and… well, she takes care of me. It's… it’s nice, having her here. Though I do miss my independence sometimes. She is very good to me, truly. She worries a lot, naturally. But she is a good daughter.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's good to hear you have Isabelle's support. Now, Mr. Bahta, to help me get a better understanding of your current state, I would like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It will involve a few simple questions and tasks, just to assess your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. If it will help, I am happy to do it. I assure you, I am still quite capable! Though, as I said, small things… they sometimes slip my mind. But I will do my best. Just let me know what you would like me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll start with a simple task. I'm going to say three unrelated words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them after a short delay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I have them. Apple, table, penny. Quite simple, really. Now, what happens next?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your current location and the date. This is just to assess your orientation. First, what is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. Let me think. It is… August. I believe it is the 2nd of August. Yes, August 2nd. And the year is… 2025. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct, Mr. Bahta. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city…? Oh dear. That is… difficult. I know we are in the village, near… near my doctor, Dr. Dubois. But the name of the city… I'm afraid I don’t recall. It’s… slipping my mind. Is it… is it near the coast? I think it's near the coast. But I cannot say the name for certain. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bahta. Don't worry about it. Sometimes those details are harder to remember. Now, let’s try something else. I'm going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Count backwards from 100 by sevens…? Yes, I understand the instruction. But… that sounds… difficult. I’m not sure I can do that. I haven't done anything like that in years. But I will try, if you wish. Just… bear with me. 100… minus seven is… 93. Yes, 93. And then…? Oh dear. This is harder than I thought. 86, perhaps? Is that correct? Or is that wrong? I am getting confused.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bahta. You’re doing very well. These are just simple tests to get a better understanding of your cognitive function. Based on the assessment we’ve done today, and considering your fall, memory concerns, reduced motivation, and family history, I believe further evaluation is warranted. While it’s not possible to make a definitive diagnosis at this point, these findings suggest the possibility of mild cognitive impairment, potentially related to early dementia. However, it’s also important to rule out other possible causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions. I would like to order some blood tests and a brain scan to further investigate. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A brain scan…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Dementia…? My mother…? I… I see. So you think something is… wrong? But I feel… mostly alright. A little forgetful, yes. But not… unwell. Blood tests, yes. That is fine. But a brain scan…? I need to think about that, Doctor. Perhaps… perhaps Isabelle should be present when you explain it. What exactly does it involve? And… what if something is wrong? What are the next steps? I feel… a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Bahta. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed when facing the possibility of such a diagnosis. Let’s take things one step at a time. The blood tests are to rule out any common medical conditions that can cause cognitive changes, like vitamin B12 deficiency or thyroid problems. The brain scan, specifically an MRI, is a non-invasive imaging procedure that allows us to visualize the structure of your brain. It doesn’t involve any radiation and is generally very safe. It will help us identify any changes in the brain that could be contributing to your symptoms. It will not give us a definitive answer, but it will provide valuable information. If the scan shows changes suggestive of dementia, we would discuss potential causes and treatment options, which may include medication to help manage symptoms and lifestyle changes to support your cognitive function. We would also explore support services for you and Isabelle. It’s important to remember that a diagnosis doesn’t necessarily mean a drastic change in your life immediately. We would work together to create a plan tailored to your needs and goals. I would be happy to discuss this further with you and Isabelle at a follow-up appointment. Would you like me to schedule that now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A follow-up appointment, with Isabelle. That would be best. I need her there, to… to help me understand everything. And to ask questions. I’m not sure I can do this alone. Yes, schedule it for… next week, perhaps? Whenever is convenient for you. I need to think about… everything. And to talk to Isabelle. And… to prepare myself. Yes, next week would be fine. Thank you, Doctor Shely. Thank you for… for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bahta. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you and Isabelle next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. That will give you both some time to discuss things beforehand. I’m glad I could provide some clarity, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before then. We'll work through this together. I’ll also have the lab orders for the blood tests sent to your primary care physician, Dr. Dubois, and they can schedule those for you at your convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
