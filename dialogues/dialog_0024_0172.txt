DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I am here. My husband insisted. Something about… a check-up? New to the area, you see, and he worries so. It’s all rather tiresome, if you must know. I suppose just… fulfilling requirements. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: “Requirements.” Right. Well, even if it is simply to satisfy your husband, a basic assessment is… prudent. It's rarely a waste of time. Let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me anything at all about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… Honestly, Doctor, at my age, one expects a certain… decline. I get up in the mornings, I manage my household, I haven't fallen apart completely. Is that what you require? I truly don’t recall any significant ailments. A bit of stiffness, perhaps, but nothing a good rest doesn't cure. Though, my memory… isn’t what it used to be. Which is likely why I’m here, isn’t it? Do you need specifics? Because I assure you, I haven’t kept a detailed log.
DOCTOR: A detailed log is…ideal, Ms. Engelhaupt, but rarely provided. Let’s attempt a quick review of systems then. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite. Well, I eat. My husband is a very good cook, thankfully. Though, I suppose I haven’t been as enthusiastic about large meals lately. Weight… I couldn't possibly say. I haven’t stepped on a scale in… decades, I imagine. It’s a rather vulgar practice, if you ask me. I simply wear what fits. Does that answer your question sufficiently? I’d prefer to move on, if possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Goodness, no. Though, my heart does race when my grandchildren visit. Such energetic children! Chest pain… occasionally a bit of discomfort, but I attribute that to indigestion. My husband’s cooking, again, you understand. He does enjoy rich sauces. Are we nearing the end of this… inquiry? I have a luncheon appointment, you see.
DOCTOR: We are not "nearing the end," Ms. Engelhaupt. A proper assessment requires… thoroughness. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Is this necessary? I assure you, I don’t discuss such… personal matters with strangers. And frankly, I find the line of questioning rather impertinent. I am a respectable woman. If you must know, everything functions… as it should. Now, can we please conclude this? I haven't got all day, and I truly don’t see the point of dwelling on these unpleasant details.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed… expediently. Any recent dizziness, headaches, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, a bit of dizziness now and then. Though I blame that on standing up too quickly. I am a tall woman, you see. And headaches… occasionally. A bit of throbbing, nothing debilitating. My vision… well, things aren't as sharp as they used to be, naturally. Reading is a bit more challenging. But honestly, Doctor, these are all things that come with age. Are we absolutely required to enumerate every minor discomfort? I assure you, I am not on death’s door.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you experienced any difficulty with your memory, or any changes in your mood or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Doctor, you wound me. As if you haven't been diligently noting my… lapses in recollection throughout this entire ordeal. My memory is, shall we say, not what it once was. And my sleep? Adequate. Though I do find myself waking up occasionally, worrying about the state of the world. Is that a sufficient answer? I believe I have thoroughly addressed your… concerns. May I be excused now? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’ve reviewed your chart and, based on your responses… and your husband’s insistence, we’ll conduct a brief physical exam. It’s standard procedure. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Afterwards, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Do try to remain still.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. Very well, Doctor. But do be quick about it. And please, try not to poke and prod too much. I am a rather delicate woman, you understand. And do be mindful of my height. A standard examination table is hardly designed for someone of my stature. Let’s simply get this over with.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 88. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, if you'll please take a deep breath… and another… Good. Lungs sound clear, but with diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let's listen to your heart… Murmur present, grade 2/6, systolic ejection at the apex. Not particularly concerning at this stage, but warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Murmur? Goodness, that sounds dreadful. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I require… hospitalization? My husband will be terribly upset. He worries so. And honestly, this table is most uncomfortable. I feel quite faint. Do you have a chair, perhaps? A comfortable one? And what does "grade 2/6" even mean? You're speaking in riddles, Doctor. I simply want a straightforward answer. Is my heart… broken?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Engelhaupt, your heart is not “broken.” A grade 2/6 murmur is… a relatively common finding in individuals your age. It simply indicates some degree of valve thickening. It doesn’t necessarily require hospitalization. However, given your elevated blood pressure and the presence of the murmur, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. And a simple blood test to check your cholesterol levels. We'll also need to repeat your blood pressure readings over the next few weeks to monitor it. I’ll write the orders now. It’s a precaution, nothing more.
PATIENT: An electrocardiogram? Blood tests? Goodness, this is becoming quite a production. Must we really? I feel perfectly fine, aside from a bit of stiffness and the occasional headache. And honestly, I loathe needles. My husband insists on these… tests, doesn't he? He’s always been a bit of a hypochondriac. Well, if it must be done, I suppose it must be done. But I expect a full explanation of everything, Doctor. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I am a patient, not a science experiment. Now, can we please conclude this ordeal? I have a luncheon appointment, you know. And I really must get my hair done. It's looking rather dreadful, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for the EKG and blood work. The results will be sent to my office, and we'll discuss them at a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Here’s a requisition form for the tests. And a printed list of medications to avoid before the blood work. I also recommend a low-sodium diet and regular, moderate exercise. Though, frankly, I doubt you’ll follow that advice. I’ll see you in two weeks. The nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. And please, try to get your blood pressure checked regularly at home. It’s essential. .
PATIENT: Honestly, the nerve of some people. Regular exercise? A low-sodium diet? As if I haven't lived a perfectly respectable life for seventy-nine years. And to suggest I haven't… I suppose I should inform my husband of this… condemnation. Though, he'll likely just fuss and worry even more. I wish I hadn't bothered coming here at all. It's all so tiresome. .
