DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, Doctor. It’s about this…procedure. The one I’m paying for. I need to be cleared for it, that’s all. My nephew said I needed a check-up first, something about making sure I won’t…well, you know. Kick the bucket on the table.
DOCTOR: Right, yes…the procedure. Your nephew was quite thorough in his scheduling. Let's see...to ensure your safety, we need to get a good understanding of your current health status. Could you tell me a little more about why you're having this procedure done?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s vanity, if you must know. My face…it’s just not what it used to be. Sags, wrinkles, the whole nine yards. My grandson says I look “tired.” Tired! As if I haven’t earned a few wrinkles after eighty-one years. It’s a perfectly reasonable request, Doctor. I want to look presentable. Is that so hard to understand? And frankly, I'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible. I have better things to do than sit here answering questions all day.
DOCTOR: Understandable, Mr. Orwin. Certainly. We want you happy with the results, of course. Before we proceed with the clearance, I just need to run through some standard questions to make sure everything is alright. It’s mostly just to be safe. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems…anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Now you want my life story? Look, I’m a sturdy Norwegian. Always been healthy as a horse. A few aches and pains, what do you expect? I had a touch of the flu maybe ten years ago, but nothing serious. My wife, bless her soul, she had a bit of trouble with her blood pressure towards the end, but that was her. I don’t have any of those fancy ailments. I’ve always eaten well, worked hard, and kept to myself. Is that good enough? Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No major medical history as you’ve described. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Appendicitis when I was a boy, and a hernia repair…oh, must be forty years ago now. Nothing since then. I don’t go under the knife unless absolutely necessary. And this…this isn’t necessary, Doctor. It’s…optional. A little touch-up. Really, I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. Just a little something for my joints now and then. The arthritis, you know. Nothing fancy. A small blue pill, can’t remember the name, doctor prescribed it years ago. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, a half a tablet of something…my daughter brings it over. She’s good like that. That’s it. Honestly, I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Joint medication and something for sleep…Do you know the dosage of either of these?
PATIENT: Dosage? Good grief. Look, I don’t measure things out like a chemist. The doctor told me to take one of the blue ones when my knuckles ache, and my daughter tells me a half of the other one before bed. That's all I know! I'm not a pharmacist, you know. Do you really need to know exactly how much? It's hardly going to affect a face lift, is it? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It's just standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. It's important to have a complete picture. Let’s move on. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I've lived a long life, I've eaten all sorts of things. I once tried snails in France, though I didn’t much care for them. But no allergies. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, not to dust, not to anything. I’m a pretty robust fellow, as I said. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for… My mother lived to be ninety, healthy as a horse until the very end. My father…heart trouble, I think. But that was a long time ago. Most of them just…died of old age. That's what happens when you live a long life, Doctor. People eventually pass away. Is this really important? I mean, I'm not trying to run a marathon here. Just a little nip and tuck.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart trouble in the family. And finally, just a couple of lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My wife always said it was foolish. No, I don’t smoke. And I hardly drink anymore, either. A glass of sherry on special occasions, that's all. Used to enjoy a beer with dinner, but I’m trying to take it easy these days. Is that satisfactory? Can we please get on with this? I have a gardening appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I've noted everything. Given your age, and your somewhat limited recall regarding medications, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to be sure. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs…standard things. And perhaps a quick look at your skin where the procedure will be performed. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Fine, fine, do what you have to. But make it quick, Doctor. I haven’t got all day, you know. And don’t expect me to remember any fancy medical terms you start throwing around. Just tell me if everything is…adequate. That’s all I need to know. Adequate. Now, get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not concerning for your age. Heart rate is regular, a slight murmur, likely benign. Lungs are clear. Now, if you could just lie back for me, so I can take a look at your skin…
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss. It’s just a little facelift. My skin is fine! I've been out in the sun, yes, but I always used oil. My wife insisted. Don’t go poking around too much, Doctor. It's delicate. And try not to make a mess of things, alright? I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to be laying here for hours. Just tell me if it's “adequate”, like I said before.
DOCTOR: Skin is somewhat weathered, as expected. Some loss of elasticity, consistent with age. No unusual lesions or areas of concern. Your skin is…adequate for the procedure, Mr. Orwin. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend a quick EKG just to be on the safe side. It’s a quick, non-invasive test, and it will give us peace of mind. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An EKG? Now you want to attach wires to me? Honestly, Doctor, you're going to kill me with the preparation for this procedure! This is ridiculous. I’ve lived a long, healthy life, and I don't need a bunch of tests. I just want a little help looking presentable. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, really? It sounds…invasive. And I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. However, given your age, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, an EKG is a standard precaution to rule out any underlying heart issues that could potentially complicate the procedure. It’s a quick test, takes only a few minutes, and will allow the surgeon to proceed with confidence. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't necessary. Perhaps we could compromise. If you're truly reluctant, I can consult with the surgeon and get their opinion. But I strongly advise against proceeding without some form of cardiac assessment. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Consult with your surgeon. Do whatever you have to do to get this over with. But if they say it’s absolutely necessary, I expect a full explanation. And I don’t want to be kept waiting all day while you discuss it. I have a garden to tend, you know. Honestly, the fuss over a little facelift…it's enough to make a man’s blood pressure go up! Just…hurry up about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ve contacted the surgeon and requested their input. It may take a few minutes for them to respond. In the meantime, let’s just review your medications one last time… You mentioned a blue pill for your joints and something for sleep…Do you happen to remember what the packaging looked like?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you’re still on about the pills? It's been a week! I'm an eighty-one year old man, not a pharmacist! The blue one came in a small, orange bottle, I think. And the other one…it was white, I suppose. A little oblong, maybe? My daughter handles all that, really. She keeps them in her purse. Look, I'm telling you, it's not important! I've been taking them for years with no problems. Why all the questions? It's just…a little help getting to sleep. Now, are we going to talk about my surgery, or spend the rest of the afternoon discussing pills?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration. It’s just… due diligence. We need to cover all bases, even if it seems repetitive. I just received a response from the surgeon. They concur with my recommendation for an EKG, and they won’t proceed with the procedure without it. They've also requested a recent blood test to check your kidney function. I know it's frustrating, but it’s for your safety. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an EKG? You're trying to kill me! This is utterly ridiculous! Fine! Do what you have to do. But I want it on the record that I protested vehemently! And I expect a full explanation of everything afterwards. I don’t want to be poked and prodded with no understanding of what’s going on. And I expect the surgeon to be gentle. Honestly, I've never encountered so much fuss over something so simple. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, please be careful. I’ll have a nurse draw your blood and prepare you for the EKG immediately. It won’t take long, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. But your safety is my priority. Nurse, could you please assist Mr. Orwin with the blood draw and EKG?
