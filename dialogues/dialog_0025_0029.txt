DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It's… it’s hard to explain exactly. I just… I get full awful quick now. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, a few bites and I feel like I could burst. It's been going on for a couple months, I'd say. Not a pain, exactly, just… stuffed.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A couple months, you say. And it's not a burning or cramping, just… fullness?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not cramping either. Just… like someone put a brick in my stomach, even if I haven’t eaten much. It's a strange feeling, really. It doesn't really hurt, it's just… uncomfortable and makes me not want to eat, which my wife doesn't like, 'cause she worries I'm losing weight. And I probably am, a little.
DOCTOR: Right. So, early satiety – feeling full quickly – for about two months. And your wife’s noticed some weight loss. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with this, or right after you eat?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no vomiting. And not much nausea, either. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but not often. It's more the full feeling is the problem, not sickness. It just… stops me. I used to enjoy my food, you know? Now it's just… a chore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. We haven't changed our diet much. Still eat the same things, mostly fish and rice, some vegetables from the garden when they're good. I started taking a new vitamin a couple months back, right around when this started, but it’s just a general one, you know? For older folks. Don't even remember the name of it. My wife gets it for me.
DOCTOR: A general vitamin, okay. We'll need to look into that later. Now, aside from the fullness and possible weight loss, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. I get tired easier, maybe, but that's just getting old, I figure. My joints ache a bit in the mornings, but that’s nothing new. No trouble breathing, no… well, nothing else really. Just this stomach thing. It’s mostly just annoying, to be honest. Makes it hard to enjoy a nice meal with the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… they're… regular enough, I suppose. Not as much going as there used to be, if you know what I mean. A little… harder sometimes. But nothing terribly different, really. Old age, I guess. I don't want to make a fuss over things that are just part of getting older, you understand?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. So, decreased frequency and some increased difficulty. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color?
PATIENT: No, no blood. And the color seems normal enough. Just… you know, the usual browns. I pay attention to those things, being an older fella. My wife always tells me to. She says it's important. I'm not a doctor, but I know when things look different, if that makes sense. Everything looks alright, just… less of it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that’s about it for serious things. High blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with pills for years. Doctor always said it was just part of getting older, like everything else. Nothing else major, really. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. No surgeries other than the appendix, and I haven't been in the hospital for anything in… well, decades.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. A little white one, I think. And that vitamin my wife got me, but I don't know the name of it. She keeps it in the kitchen, and I just take one with breakfast. I think it has all sorts of things in it… B vitamins and stuff. She says it's good for energy, but I haven't noticed much difference, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I haven't had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. My wife asks me every time, but I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Don't react to much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me a little bit about your family history. Any history of stomach problems or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother had trouble with her stomach sometimes, heartburn and indigestion mostly. She lived to be 85, though, so it wasn't anything serious. My father… he died of a heart attack when he was pretty young. And my brother… he had some kind of trouble with his lungs, but I don’t know much about it. Not that I know of any stomach cancer or anything like that in the family. We're mostly a healthy bunch, all things considered. Though, you know, people die of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife doesn’t like it, and frankly, I don't either. And I haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be thirty years now. Used to have a little beer with dinner sometimes, but I gave it up. Doctor told me it was better for my blood pressure. Now, I just drink tea. Lots and lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen. Just lie back on the table, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper part of your stomach. No masses or rebound tenderness. It's not terribly concerning, but it's good to note. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, to get a better idea of what's going on. And I'd like to do a stool test to rule out any bleeding.
PATIENT: That sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my stomach. It’s just… annoying, you know? Makes it hard to enjoy things. And my wife worries. I appreciate you listening to me. What about that vitamin? Do you think that could be causing this?
DOCTOR: It's possible the vitamin could be contributing, though it’s hard to say for sure. Some vitamins can cause stomach upset. We'll need to see the results of the blood work before we can determine the cause. While we wait for those results, I recommend stopping the vitamin to see if your symptoms improve. We'll also check for any signs of anemia with the blood work, which can sometimes cause early satiety. I want to be thorough. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and give you the instructions for the stool test. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you start experiencing severe pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Stop the vitamin, and watch for anything worse. I'll do that. And I'll let you know if anything changes. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time. Hopefully, it's just that vitamin. My wife's going to be relieved to hear that might be it. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started with the blood draw and give you the stool test kit. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we'll discuss a plan. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. You have a good day, Mr. Obarr. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
