DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kobler. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing, I think. It’s been getting harder, slowly. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry all the time. It’s…uncomfortable, to say the least. I don’t really know why it’s happening, though. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, slowly getting harder to breathe, and dryness in your mouth and eyes… I see. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…difficult to say precisely. It feels like it’s been creeping up on me for…a while now. Perhaps a few months? It’s not sudden, thankfully. Just…gradual. I find myself pausing more often when I walk, or…getting winded easily. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific date, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kobler, don't worry about pinpointing an exact date. A few months is helpful. And you mentioned it’s gradual, not sudden—that’s good to know. Besides walking, are there any other activities that make your breathing harder?
PATIENT: Let me see… climbing stairs definitely. Even just… carrying groceries upstairs. Anything that requires a bit of effort, really. It’s not… debilitating, not yet. But it’s noticeable. And it’s… worrying, I suppose. It’s just… harder to do things I used to do without thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, exertion seems to bring it on. And you mentioned the dry mouth and eyes… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. The dryness. It’s particularly bad in the mornings, when I wake up. And it doesn’t really go away completely throughout the day. I find myself drinking water constantly, and blinking a lot. I carry lip balm with me everywhere, to be honest. It’s just… a persistent feeling of being parched. It's rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant dryness, worse in the mornings… okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing difficulty and dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… I have been feeling a bit more tired lately. Just… general fatigue. I thought it was just from… well, from life. But perhaps it’s connected? I haven’t really paid much attention, to be perfectly honest. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m not sure if it’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Kobler. Fatigue can definitely be relevant. And no, you’re not rambling at all. Let's see… breathing difficulty, dry mouth and eyes, and fatigue. Do you have any cough, fever, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No cough, no fever, and no chest pain. It’s just… these three things. The breathing, the dryness, and the tiredness. It's not a sharp pain, or anything alarming like that. Just… a general feeling of being unwell, I suppose. It's a subtle discomfort, more than anything. Is that… concerning? I apologize if I’m being vague. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Kobler. It’s good to know you don't have a cough, fever or chest pain. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I was divorced a few years back, if that counts as a medical condition. But seriously… I don’t believe so. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything significant, as far as I know. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’ve always been fairly healthy, up until recently. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant? I apologize again if I'm not providing enough information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. Your insurance is good to know, thank you. And divorce isn’t a medical condition! Don’t worry about that. You said you’ve always been fairly healthy. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Nothing of that nature. I’ve managed to avoid the operating room, thankfully. I've always been rather… careful, I suppose. I avoid risky activities, and I try to maintain a… moderate lifestyle. Oh, except for… I did have my tonsils removed when I was a child. A very long time ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for mentioning that, Ms. Kobler. Tonsil removal is good to know. Now, regarding your family history… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s… a difficult question. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical information, to be honest. My mother… she passed away several years ago, and I don’t recall her having any major illnesses. My father… he wasn’t very open about his health either. I believe he had some heart trouble towards the end, but I’m not certain. It's not something we talked about much. I apologize for my lack of clarity, Doctor. It's frustrating to not know more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kobler. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I’ve never been inclined towards such things. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, to be honest. I assure you, I'm a very… law-abiding citizen.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Kobler. Now, before I do a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe I’m allergic to penicillin. I had a reaction to it when I was younger – a rash, I think. Nothing too severe, but enough for my doctor to advise me to avoid it. Aside from that… no, I don't believe I have any other allergies. I've always been fairly lucky in that regard. I can eat most foods without issue, and I haven't had any problems with plants or animals. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Kobler. Penicillin allergy noted. Okay. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and take your blood pressure. Then I'll do a brief examination of your mouth and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I trust your judgement completely. I'm ready when you are. I understand these things are necessary, and I appreciate you taking the time to examine me thoroughly. I'm a bit anxious, naturally, but I'm trying to remain calm.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… good. Your breathing sounds slightly wheezy, especially on exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit rapid. Blood pressure is 130/80. Oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within normal limits. Your mouth is dry, as you mentioned. Your throat appears a bit inflamed, but no visible sores or lesions. Okay. Wheezing, dry mouth, mild throat inflammation… Now, I’d like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would you be okay with a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…reasonable. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and chest X-ray… Certainly. If you believe those tests are necessary, then I trust your judgment completely. I want to understand what's causing these symptoms, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to find out. When would those tests be scheduled? And will the insurance cover them? I apologize for asking about the insurance again, but it's always a concern.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kobler. Those are standard tests to rule out various possibilities. The lab is right down the hall, so we can get the blood work done immediately. We’ll schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street. Regarding your insurance, private insurance should cover these tests. We'll submit the claim for you, and you can always check with your insurance provider directly if you have any concerns about coverage. For now, I’m going to write you a prescription for a throat lozenge to help soothe your throat and a recommendation to increase your fluid intake. I’ll also recommend a humidifier for your bedroom to help with the dryness. Once we have the results of the tests, we’ll discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…excellent. Blood work now, X-ray tomorrow, lozenges and humidifier… I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for handling the insurance claim – that’s a great relief. I'm feeling a bit more reassured, knowing we’re taking concrete steps to address this. I will certainly increase my fluid intake and look into a humidifier. Do you have any recommendations for brands, perhaps? Or any specific things I should be aware of while I’m waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kobler. As for humidifiers, any cool mist humidifier will do. Avoid warm mist humidifiers, as they can sometimes harbor bacteria. I recommend cleaning it regularly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As for waiting for results, be mindful of any new or worsening symptoms – fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or anything else that concerns you. If anything changes, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. We’ll have the results back tomorrow afternoon, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that answers everything. You've been incredibly helpful and thorough. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. I will follow your instructions carefully, increase my fluid intake, look into a humidifier, and be mindful of any new symptoms. Thank you again for everything. I suppose I'll head down to the lab now, then. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kobler. Thank you for coming in. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. The lab technician will take good care of you. Get well soon. .
