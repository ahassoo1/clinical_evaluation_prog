DOCTOR: Alright, Lindsey, good to see you. Or, uh… good to meet you. Eighty-eight, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Eighty-eight years young, if you believe in such things! Though sometimes I feel a good bit older, I won’t lie. It’s good to meet you too, Doctor… Gorga, is it? I read your name on the door. A fine-looking clinic you’ve got here, out in the country like this. Peaceful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Gorga. And thank you, it is peaceful. Less… hectic than the city. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse gave me a paper with some numbers on it after my blood work. Something about my cholesterol being… high? I don’t really understand all that medical stuff, to be honest. She said I needed to talk to you about it. Is it bad? I feel alright, mostly. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's just old age, I figure.
DOCTOR: Right, the cholesterol. Yes, I see it here. It is a little elevated. Not immediately alarming, but… we should talk about it. Okay, so “high cholesterol.” Can you tell me, has anyone ever told you about this before?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I recall. I’ve had doctors over the years, of course, but no one ever said anything about my cholesterol specifically. Just the usual check-ups, you know? Blood pressure, weight… told me to eat more vegetables a few times. But never a specific number, or a warning about it being… high. I’m a pretty simple eater, to be honest. Mostly fish and potatoes. And a little bit of Swedish rye bread when I can get it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnosis. Fish and potatoes… good. That’s a decent start. Now, when was the last time you had a full check-up?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was Doctor Svenson, back in… oh, goodness. Must have been about five years ago, maybe a little longer. He retired, you see, and I haven’t really found another doctor since. Just haven’t gotten around to it, I suppose. It's not that I want to be difficult, but going to the city… it's a bit of a trek. That’s why I was so pleased to hear about you being out here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Five years… okay. And in those five years, have you noticed any changes in your health?
PATIENT: Well… not much, really. I get a little more tired some days. And my memory isn't what it used to be, naturally. But I figure that’s just getting older. I can still remember things from when I was a boy, clear as a bell, but remembering what I had for breakfast? That's another story. Oh, and my ankles swell up a bit if I stand too long. But I mostly just sit and read these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, some memory issues, and ankle swelling. Are you having any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No chest pain, no trouble breathing, and my head feels as steady as it ever was. I walk a little slower than I used to, but that's just the knees, I expect. I still manage to get around the house alright, and I can still do a bit of gardening when the weather is nice. Mostly just pulling weeds these days, mind you. Heavy lifting is for younger folks.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness is good. Now, let’s just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I haven’t had a proper exam in so long, I’ve likely forgotten how they work these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, just hop up on the table for me. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first, and then check your pulse. After that, we'll take a look at your ankles. Deep breaths, if you could. Heart sounds… regular, but a slight murmur. Not terribly concerning at this age, but we’ll note it. Pulse is… a little fast, but nothing too alarming. Now, let’s take a look at those ankles. Can you point to where you notice the swelling?
PATIENT: There we go… getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, I tell you that. It's mostly here, on both sides. Not terribly bad, mind you, but they definitely get puffier at the end of the day. Especially if I’ve been sitting for a long time. Feels a bit tight sometimes, but not painful. It’s just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the swelling. And the skin feels… warm. No redness or significant tenderness, which is good. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are… diminished, but that's not unexpected at your age. Now, just one more thing. I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Sounds… normal. No unusual sounds. Everything seems… alright. Now, let’s talk about what we’ve found.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking your time. You've certainly had a good look at me. So, what does all this… mean? Is it something serious? I'm not one for fuss, you understand. I just want to know if it’s something I need to worry about, or if it’s just… old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Well, Lindsey, it’s not an emergency, no. But we do need to address the high cholesterol and the ankle swelling. The cholesterol increases your risk of heart problems down the road, and the swelling… could be related to a few things. It could be mild heart failure, or it could be something simpler, like poor circulation. Because of your age and the fact you haven't seen a doctor in five years, I want to be cautious. I recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm and an ultrasound of your heart to see how well it’s pumping. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An… EKG? And an… ultrasound? Goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor… I trust your judgment, of course. But are they… uncomfortable? And how much will all this cost? I don’t have any insurance, you see. Just lived on a pension all these years.
DOCTOR: The EKG is painless, Lindsey. We just put some stickers on your chest. The ultrasound… it involves a probe on your chest, but it shouldn’t be painful either. As for the cost… It’s not inexpensive. I’m afraid it will be around $400 for the EKG and $600 for the ultrasound. I understand that’s a lot, especially without insurance. There's a hospital about an hour away that has a financial assistance program. I can write you a referral and they might be able to work with you on a payment plan. In the meantime, let’s start with a few lifestyle changes. We’ll talk about diet and exercise. And I'm going to prescribe a low dose statin to start lowering that cholesterol. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A thousand dollars… goodness gracious. That’s a bit of a shock, to be honest. I suppose I could try the hospital, but an hour's drive… and filling out all those papers… it sounds like a lot of fuss. But I suppose it's better than nothing. A statin, you say? What are the side effects of that? I don't want to trade one problem for another. I've always been careful with what I take, and I try to stay active, even if it's just a little bit of gardening. But a low dose… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose I can try it. Just please tell me what to watch out for.
DOCTOR: The most common side effects of statins are muscle aches and fatigue. It's usually mild, but you should let me know immediately if you experience any severe muscle pain, weakness, or unusual tiredness. Also, we'll need to monitor your liver function with blood tests regularly. The blood tests will be about $50 each. We’ll do one in a month, then every three months if everything looks good. I understand this is a lot to take in. We can start slowly. Just the statin for now, and we can look into the hospital referral and the blood tests later. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… more reasonable. Start with the statin, then see how it goes. I appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, all this medical talk. Muscle aches… I suppose I’ll pay close attention. And I'll try to remember to mention it if I start feeling more tired than usual. What about the diet? You said something about that. I’ve always eaten pretty simply. Fish and potatoes, mostly. Is that… bad? Should I be avoiding something? I don’t want to change my whole way of life just because of a few numbers on a paper.
DOCTOR: Fish and potatoes isn't bad, Lindsey, not at all. But we can make a few small adjustments. Try to incorporate more vegetables, like leafy greens and broccoli. And cut back on red meat. We also need to watch your salt intake. A little less salt can help with the ankle swelling. And try to get a little more exercise, even if it’s just a short walk each day. It doesn’t have to be strenuous. I have some pamphlets here on heart-healthy eating. I’ll give you those to take home. And I'll write you a prescription for a low-dose statin. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. More vegetables, less salt, a little walking… I can do that. I used to have a garden, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. But I can still potter around a bit. A pamphlet, you say? Yes, that would be helpful. And the prescription… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It’s a bit of a shock, getting old, and all this… medical attention. But I suppose it’s better to know, than not to know. So, a follow-up in a month? I'll mark it on my calendar.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lindsey. Here are the pamphlets. And the prescription. We'll see you in a month. If you experience any muscle pain, weakness, or unusual tiredness, call the office immediately. Don't wait for your appointment. It was good to meet you, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Gorga. You’ve been very kind. It was good to meet you too. I'll try to remember everything you’ve told me. And I will call if anything… unusual happens.
