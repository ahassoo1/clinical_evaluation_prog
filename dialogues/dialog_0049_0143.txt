DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated for me to explain, to be honest. My daughter, she wants… she’s thinking about having a baby. And I think… I think she wants me to… check things first? Before… you know. It’s for her, mostly. I just want to make sure everything’s okay, if that makes sense. I don't really understand all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re here on behalf of your daughter, to… preemptively assess your own health in relation to a potential pregnancy she’s considering. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… yes, that’s it exactly. She thought it was a good idea. I trust her, but… I'm an older fella, you see. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a long time. I’m not sure what they even look for. Is this normal, even? To check me before… she gets pregnant?
DOCTOR: It's… not entirely uncommon, though often the focus is on the prospective mother, naturally. It's prudent to assess potential risks from the paternal side as well. We’re looking for anything that could be genetically inherited or impact your overall health during the course of her pregnancy, should she conceive. It's good that you're thinking proactively. Let’s start with a little history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… I had a bad fall when I was younger, working construction. Broke my arm, I think. And… I get a bit breathless sometimes, walking up hills. But… nothing major, really. I don't remember being sick, sick. Just… old aches and pains, you know? And… I don't really go to the doctor, so nobody’s ever told me about anything significant. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm in the past, and some breathlessness. The breathlessness is worth noting – how long has that been happening, and does anything specific make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, the breathlessness… it’s been… a while. Years, probably. It comes and goes. Worse when I’m walking uphill, like I said. Or… if I’m doing something strenuous. Gardening, maybe. And… if it's very humid. It doesn't really stop me doing things, but… I do slow down a bit. I just thought it was… getting old, to be honest. It’s never been bad enough to bother the doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to explore that a little further. Do you have any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Heart problems… That’s a tough one. My… my father, he died young. Something with… with his chest, I think. But nobody really talked about it. It was a long time ago, and… well, we didn’t have doctors like we do now. My mother… she lived to be very old, actually. I don't remember anything about her having heart trouble. Does that help? I’m really sorry, I wish I could be more specific. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It's understandable. Vague recollections are common. We can work with what you remember. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking. Any at all, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take… Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Just when I really need it, though. And… I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be on the safe side. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, to be honest. I'm not a big fan of doctors, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen occasionally, and a multivitamin. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been able to eat anything, and… well, I haven’t really been stung by a bee or anything. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Does that… is that good? I try to avoid things that might cause problems, but I haven’t ever had a proper allergic reaction, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Not a smoker. Never liked it. My wife… she used to smoke, a little, but I always asked her to do it outside. I always thought it was a terrible habit. It never appealed to me, not even when I was younger. Never touched a cigarette in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Oh… well, I used to drink a little, years ago. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. But… not anymore. Not for a long time. Not really. My wife… she liked a glass of wine, and I’d have one with her. But since… since she passed, I haven’t really bothered with it. I don't really enjoy it on my own, to be honest. It just doesn’t taste the same, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, Mr. Verrall, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination… Oh… right. Yes, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I haven’t had one of those in… well, decades, probably. I hope it won't take too long. I'm not very good with doctors, you see. What will you be doing? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: It won’t take long, Mr. Verrall. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. Just a standard check-up. It will help me to get a better picture of your current health and ensure you’re fit enough for your daughter’s plans. Would you mind if I start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… Alright. If you think it's best. Yes, go ahead. Is it… is it painful? I don't like needles, you see. I’m a bit of a… a wimp, when it comes to doctors. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: No needles at this stage, Mr. Verrall. Just the cuff around your arm. It will feel a bit of pressure, like a firm squeeze, but it shouldn’t be painful. Could you please sit back and relax, and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright… here you go. Just… let me know if it’s going to be… strong. My arm isn’t what it used to be, you see. I used to be very strong, working construction, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax your arm completely. I’m going to inflate the cuff now. … 130 over 80. Not bad. A little elevated, but within an acceptable range for your age. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out. … I hear a slight wheeze in your lower lungs. Could you take a few deeper breaths for me?
PATIENT: That's… a bit difficult, to be honest. It always feels a bit tight in my chest. Like something's… blocking my airways. I just thought it was… getting old. Is it bad? Is it something I should worry about? I don’t want to be a bother…
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something to panic about, Mr. Verrall, but the wheezing does suggest some possible airway obstruction. It could be related to allergies, asthma, or simply age-related changes in your lungs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. The X-ray will help rule out any structural issues, and the pulmonary function test will assess how well your lungs are working. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a test… Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I don’t like… being poked and prodded. Is it… is it necessary? For my daughter, you mean? Is it really important? I just want to be sure… I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, or… or money. I'm not very good with all this medical stuff, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it’s understandable that you’re hesitant. However, given the wheezing I detected and your history of breathlessness, these tests are important to establish a baseline and ensure your health is optimal should your daughter decide to proceed with pregnancy. It will help me to rule out any underlying conditions that could potentially impact your wellbeing during that time, or the pregnancy itself. The X-ray is a simple procedure – you’ll simply stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a mouthpiece. Neither are invasive, and they will provide valuable information. I would strongly recommend them, for your own peace of mind, and for your daughter's sake. Do you have insurance coverage that might help with the costs?
PATIENT: Insurance… No, I don’t have insurance. Never really needed it, to be honest. Too expensive. And… I’m not sure I can afford all this extra… testing. Oh dear. What if… what if it’s something bad? I just want to be helpful for my daughter, but… this is all a bit overwhelming. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Without… all the tests? I just don't think I can cope with all this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your concerns about the costs and the tests. Given your lack of insurance and your apprehension, we could proceed without them, but it would mean a less comprehensive assessment. However, I would strongly advise against it. Without these tests, I’m unable to definitively rule out any potential underlying issues. It’s important to remember that your health is paramount, and any underlying condition could pose risks to both you and your daughter, should she conceive. Perhaps we can discuss options for more affordable testing facilities in the area?
PATIENT: Affordable… You mean… cheaper places? That would be… wonderful. I don't want to be a burden, you see. And I definitely don’t want to put my daughter in a difficult position. Are there… are there places that offer discounts, or… payment plans? Anything would help. I really appreciate you trying to find a solution. I just want to do what’s best, but it’s all a bit… scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I'm looking into some local facilities that offer sliding scale fees based on income, and a couple of places that sometimes run discounted health packages. It might take me a few minutes to confirm availability and pricing. In the meantime, perhaps we could discuss your daughter's plans in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Yes, that would be good. My daughter… she's always been very determined. Wants a family, very much. She's been talking about it for a while now, but… she's very thoughtful, always wants to be sure everything is… right. She wants to do things properly, you see. She’s a good girl. A very good girl. She's been talking about… IVF, I think it’s called. Is that… safe? What does that involve? I don’t really understand all the medical terms, to be honest. It all sounds very complicated.
DOCTOR: IVF, or In Vitro Fertilization, is a process where an egg is fertilized by sperm outside the body, then transferred back into the uterus. It's often used when there are difficulties conceiving naturally. It can be a safe and effective option, but it’s important to understand that it’s a complex procedure with potential risks and side effects, for both your daughter and potentially for the child. Before she proceeds with IVF, it would be crucial for her to undergo a thorough medical evaluation, including blood tests, a transvaginal ultrasound, and potentially a genetic screening. And as we’ve discussed, it’s important to assess your health as well, to minimize any potential risks. Do you have any specific concerns about IVF, or are there any questions I can answer about the procedure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Sounds… complicated, and a bit scary. Risks… what sort of risks? For my daughter… and for the baby? I don't want anything to happen to either of them. Is it… is it painful? And expensive, I suppose? I've heard it's very expensive. I just want to make sure they're both… safe. And happy. That's all I want. What are the chances of it… working? Is it likely to succeed? It's all very overwhelming, to be honest. I wish I understood more about it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, you're right to be concerned, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. IVF does carry potential risks, for both your daughter and the child. For your daughter, these include a risk of infection, bleeding, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which is a reaction to the fertility medications. There's also a small risk of ectopic pregnancy and multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets. For the child, there’s a slightly increased risk of birth defects and a higher incidence of certain genetic conditions, although these risks are relatively small, and can often be mitigated through genetic screening. As for the chances of success, it varies depending on several factors, including your daughter’s age, the quality of her eggs and sperm, and the underlying cause of infertility. In general, the success rate is lower for older women. As for the cost, yes, IVF is very expensive, typically ranging from $10,000 to $20,000 per cycle. It often requires multiple cycles to achieve a successful pregnancy. Given the complexities and potential risks involved, and the financial burden, I strongly recommend your daughter consult with a reproductive endocrinologist, who can provide a more detailed assessment and personalized guidance. It’s also important to consider the emotional toll of IVF, and whether she has a strong support system in place. We’re getting closer to finding affordable testing, let’s focus on that for now. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… very complicated, and a bit frightening. $20,000? I… I don't know how she'll afford that. And all those risks… it sounds like a lot to take on. I… I just want her to be happy, but I don’t want her to get hurt. Or the baby. I… I think I need some time to think about this. And to talk to my daughter. Maybe… maybe it's not worth it. I just don't know what to do anymore. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just… try naturally for a while longer? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, that’s perfectly understandable. It's a lot to process, and it's important to take your time and make an informed decision. You're right to consider all the options, and to prioritize your daughter's wellbeing. Trying naturally for a while longer is certainly a valid option. And perhaps, before proceeding with any expensive or invasive procedures, it would be helpful for your daughter to consult with a reproductive endocrinologist, even if just for an initial consultation, to get a better understanding of her options and to rule out any underlying issues. As for the testing we discussed, I’ve found a clinic nearby that offers a sliding scale based on income. The cost would be significantly lower than a private facility. I can provide you with their contact information. For now, let’s focus on that. And you take your time, talk to your daughter, and make a decision that feels right for both of you. I think that’s all for today. I’ll print out some information about the clinic and a summary of our discussion for you. Do you have any questions before you leave?
