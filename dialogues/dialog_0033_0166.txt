DOCTOR: Right. Tarin KINJERSKI, 20 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this numbness in my leg. It’s been… well, it’s hard to say exactly when it started, but it’s been noticeable for a few weeks now, at least. It’s mostly in my left leg, and it feels… sort of like it’s just not quite there, you know? Not painful, exactly, just… absent.
DOCTOR: Absent, you say. Weeks, at least. Hmm. And is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It’s worse after I’ve been on my feet for a long time – like after a long day at work, or if I’m walking a lot. When I’m sitting still, it usually gets better, though it doesn’t always go away completely. It’s… tricky to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, so I sometimes just ignore it until it gets annoying. I work as a special effects artist and animator, so I spend a lot of time sitting, but there are days where I'm moving around a lot on set, setting things up.
DOCTOR: Special effects…right. And does anything specifically trigger it, besides prolonged standing or walking?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… Sometimes if I cross my legs a certain way, it’ll start up. And… this might sound strange, but I noticed it a few times when I'm really focused on my work, and I tend to hunch over a bit. It feels like… pressure, maybe? Not a bad pressure, but… noticeable. Like it’s aggravating something. I don't know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Pressure…when hunched over. Alright. And have you noticed any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… that's another tricky one. It doesn't feel weak, exactly. It’s more like… clumsy? Like I don’t have quite as much control over it as I usually do. If I’m walking and not paying attention, I’ve stumbled a couple of times, but I figured I was just being clumsy. It’s hard to tell if it's the leg or just me being not coordinated, to be honest. I haven’t dropped anything or anything like that, just a little off balance sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… no, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal there. I apologize, that’s a rather personal question. Is that… is that a normal thing to ask when someone has leg numbness? I'm not sure I understand the connection.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure. We have to rule things out. Just making sure. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Any significant illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my wrist once when I was little, but that healed up fine. No surgeries or anything like that. My family… well, my mother has high blood pressure, but that's it, really. Nothing neurological that I'm aware of. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well and get enough sleep, even if it’s hard with work sometimes. Is this still about the leg? It feels like we're going down a lot of different paths.
DOCTOR: We need to establish a baseline, Mr. KINJERSKI. It's called a comprehensive assessment. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Right, of course. Sorry. Allergies… No known allergies, thankfully. No reactions to any foods or medications that I’m aware of. I haven't had any issues with pollen or anything like that, either. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything, if that helps. I do get mosquito bites really easily, but I don’t think that’s what you’re asking about.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Fine. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take any regular medications. Occasionally I’ll take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter stuff when I need it. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, to be honest. I try to tough things out, I suppose. It’s probably not a good attitude, but… that’s me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your leg. Please lie down on the table. I’ll need to do a quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good, Doctor. Just let me know what you need me to do. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. Let your legs go completely limp. …Good. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you push your foot against my hand like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Sure. Like this? I'm trying to push as hard as I can. Is that enough? I don't want to overdo it or anything. It feels… normal, I think.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check sensation. Close your eyes. Tell me when you feel this. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. Right there. And… here. It feels… normal. It’s not like it’s numb, it just feels like… regular touch. Is there supposed to be a difference between the places you’re touching? It feels like you're touching me all over, but not in a bad way, of course.
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact bilaterally. Balance seems stable. Now, can you stand up and walk for me, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Okay. One… two… three… I'm trying to keep my eyes focused straight ahead. It feels a little awkward, to be honest. I usually don’t walk so carefully. Is this… is this going to help figure out what’s wrong with my leg? I'm a bit worried now. It feels like I'm failing a test.
DOCTOR: Gait is slightly unsteady, but no significant ataxia. Now, sit back down. Alright. Based on the exam, it doesn't seem like anything acutely alarming. However, given your description of the numbness and the intermittent nature of the symptoms, I suspect it could be a nerve issue, possibly related to compression. It could be something as simple as a pinched nerve, or something more complex. To rule out more serious causes, I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and see if there’s any compression or inflammation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds acceptable. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do it. I was starting to get worried it was something really bad. A pinched nerve… that sounds… manageable. Will the MRI require any preparation? And… will it be covered by my insurance? I have private insurance, if that helps. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be resting it, or… avoiding certain activities?
DOCTOR: Yes, your private insurance should cover the MRI, but I’ll have the scheduling department verify your coverage before we proceed. As for preparation, no special steps are needed. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. You will lie flat on a table for approximately 30-60 minutes, so if you’re claustrophobic, let me know, and we can discuss options for managing that. In the meantime, avoid any activities that exacerbate the numbness or pain. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercise are okay, but listen to your body and don’t push yourself. I'll also prescribe a course of physical therapy. It may help improve your strength and flexibility. I'm going to order some bloodwork as well, just to rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… very thorough, Doctor. Yes, bloodwork and physical therapy both sound good. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I was quite worried at first, but I feel much better now knowing there’s a plan. And thank you for considering the possibility of claustrophobia. I'm not severely claustrophobic, but I don't particularly enjoy small spaces. I'll try to avoid any activities that make it worse, and I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible. Are there any specific stretches you recommend while I’m waiting?
DOCTOR: Good. The scheduling department will contact you to arrange the MRI. As for stretches, gentle hamstring stretches and lower back rotations can be helpful, but be careful not to overextend yourself. A physical therapist can provide more specific guidance tailored to your condition. I'm going to write a referral for physical therapy now. Here is the referral slip. I'll also send the lab orders to your pharmacy. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much more reassured now, and I’ll get the MRI scheduled and the physical therapy started as soon as I can. I appreciate your thoroughness and patience. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I'll be sure to call if anything changes or if I have any concerns. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. You too. Next patient. .
