DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Said my cholesterol is high. Hyper… something? I don’t really understand all that medical stuff, but they said I should come talk to someone about it. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Geho. Hyperlipidemia, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the word! Hyper… lipi… something. See? I’m terrible with remembering those big words. It’s just… my cholesterol is too high, right? Is that what it means? And is it bad?
DOCTOR: You are correct, Ms. Geho. Hyperlipidemia simply means you have higher-than-optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. It can be a concern, yes, but it’s also very manageable. We see it quite frequently. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I feel pretty good, actually. A little tired sometimes, but that's just… getting older, I guess? I walk a lot, try to stay active. I haven’t felt any pain or anything like that. Should I be feeling something?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you’re feeling generally well and staying active. Often, high cholesterol doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms, which is why routine screening is so important. Now, let’s delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. And my knees get a little achy when it’s cold, but nothing a doctor ever needed to look at. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out… maybe fifteen years ago? That was a bit rough, but I recovered okay. Everything else… I think I’m pretty healthy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Geho. Fifteen years ago for the gallbladder removal is good to know. And it’s helpful to hear you generally consider yourself healthy. Now, regarding family history – are there any instances of heart disease, high cholesterol, stroke, or diabetes in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Oh, family… yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was pretty young, maybe in his sixties. He smoked a lot, which I always told him he shouldn’t. And my mother… she had diabetes, later in life. She had to take shots for it. My brother… he’s fine, as far as I know. We don’t talk much anymore. Is that important? Knowing about my family?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Geho, that is quite important, thank you for sharing. A family history of heart disease and diabetes does increase your risk. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… okay. Well, like I said, I walk a lot. Usually a few miles every day, if the weather's nice. I live alone, so I do my own cooking. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables and fish. Not much red meat. I don’t smoke, never have. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes… maybe three or four times a week? And I do enjoy a good piece of dark chocolate. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very sensible lifestyle, Ms. Geho. Walking regularly, a diet rich in vegetables and fish, and avoiding smoking are all excellent habits. A glass of wine and a piece of dark chocolate in moderation are unlikely to be problematic. Now, let’s briefly discuss any medications you are currently taking, and any allergies you may have.
PATIENT: Okay. I don’t take any regular medications, thankfully. Just sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I'll take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? As for allergies… I’m allergic to penicillin, I found that out when I was a little girl. Gives me a terrible rash. Otherwise, no… I don’t have any other allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Penicillin allergy noted. Now, Ms. Geho, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. I don’t mind. I always get a little nervous at the doctor, but I know you’re just trying to help.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a routine check, nothing to worry about. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and peripheral pulses are good. Now, I’d like to take a look at the lab results you mentioned. The results confirm elevated LDL cholesterol – 165 mg/dL, which is above the optimal range. Your HDL is 45 mg/dL, which is acceptable, and your triglycerides are 150 mg/dL, also within normal limits. Your comprehensive metabolic panel is normal.
PATIENT: Okay… those numbers… are those bad? I don’t really understand what any of that means. LDL… is that the bad cholesterol? And what does “optimal range” even mean? I just want to know… am I in trouble?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly fair question, Ms. Geho. Let me explain. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol because it can contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. HDL cholesterol is considered “good” cholesterol, as it helps remove LDL from the arteries. Triglycerides are a type of fat in your blood. An optimal LDL cholesterol level is generally below 100 mg/dL. Yours is 165, which is elevated. However, it’s important to consider other factors, such as your age, family history, and lifestyle. Given your family history of heart disease, we need to address this. You are not in immediate trouble, but we need to take steps to lower your LDL cholesterol and reduce your risk. Do you have any questions before I outline a potential treatment plan?
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s not great, but it’s not a crisis? That’s good to know. What kind of… steps? Do I have to go on medication? I’ve always been a little worried about taking pills. And will I have to change my diet a lot? I like my food!
DOCTOR: You are correct, Ms. Geho, it’s not a crisis, but it is something we need to address proactively. Let’s discuss the options. Lifestyle modifications are always the first step. We can review your diet in more detail and ensure you’re maximizing your intake of heart-healthy foods – fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Increasing your physical activity, if feasible, is also beneficial. Regarding medication, it’s a possibility, but not necessarily the immediate course of action. We can repeat the cholesterol test in three months after implementing lifestyle changes. If your LDL cholesterol doesn’t decrease sufficiently, we can discuss statin therapy. Statins are very effective at lowering cholesterol and have a good safety profile, but we would, of course, discuss the potential benefits and risks in detail. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Ms. Geho. We will work together to develop a plan that you are comfortable with. Would you like me to provide you with some educational materials on heart-healthy eating and exercise?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. I think… if I can get the numbers down with just changing my diet and walking more, I'd really prefer that. Medication scares me a little. So let's try that first. What kind of foods should I focus on? And is there a good way to track how much I’m walking? I don’t want to overdo it, you know? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Geho. Here are some resources to get you started. Regarding diet, focus on foods low in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. Excellent choices include fruits, vegetables – particularly leafy greens and berries – whole grains like oatmeal and brown rice, lean protein sources such as fish, chicken , and beans, and healthy fats like those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil. Limit red meat, processed foods, sugary drinks, and fried foods. As for tracking your walking, a pedometer or fitness tracker can be very helpful. Many smartphones also have built-in step counters. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Start slowly and gradually increase your pace and distance as you feel comfortable. Pay attention to your knees; if you experience any pain, stop and rest. We will repeat your cholesterol test in three months to assess your progress. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. That’s a lot of information, but it doesn’t seem too scary. I’ll try my best to eat better and walk more. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Please do contact us if you have any concerns or questions along the way. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three months. In the meantime, take care and best of luck. Have a good day.
