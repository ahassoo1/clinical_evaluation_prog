DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don’t bother with the “nice to meet you” part, really. I don’t make friends with doctors. It’s never ended well. Look, I’m here because… well, my stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. Is that what this is about? Because honestly, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for being upfront with me, Dawnetta. Black stools can be concerning, and it’s good you brought it to my attention. And yes, pain medications can sometimes contribute to that, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To start, could you tell me a little more about the stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, "a little more"? What exactly do you need to know? It’s black. Like… tar. Not a pretty color, I can assure you. And it smells… well, it smells like stool, what do you expect? Is this going to take long? I had a perfectly good gardening show I was planning on watching. And it’s not like it’s new. It's been happening on and off for… oh, goodness, I don’t know, a while now. A few weeks, maybe? But it’s more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks, more noticeable lately – that’s helpful. And you’re right, “tar-like” is a good description. We're getting there. Just trying to gather enough information to understand what might be going on. When you say "on and off," could you estimate how frequently you’ve noticed the black stools over those few weeks?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's hard to say. Some days it’s normal, some days it isn’t. I don’t stare at my stool every time I go to the bathroom, you know. I have better things to do. Maybe… two or three times a week it’s dark? But like I said, it comes and goes. It's probably just the pills, right? I mean, I take a lot of them. And my husband always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re keeping track as best you can. It's reasonable to suspect the pain pills, and we will consider that. However, black stool can also indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, so we need to investigate that possibility as well to be safe. Now, besides the color change, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Bleeding?! Oh, don't tell me that. I knew it. Something always goes wrong. I swear, my body is just falling apart. No, no other changes. It’s… regular, I suppose. Not loose, not hard. Just… black. And smells like stool. Are you going to want me to describe the smell now? Because frankly, that’s ridiculous. I am not describing the smell of my stool.
DOCTOR: No, no need to describe the smell, Dawnetta. You’ve told me enough. I apologize if I caused you any alarm mentioning bleeding. It’s just something we have to rule out. To clarify, when you say “regular,” are we talking about roughly the same number of times you go to the bathroom each day, or is that a recent change as well?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. It’s the same. I go… well, let me think. Usually once in the morning, sometimes twice if I’ve had a lot of fiber. It hasn’t changed. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. You're making a mountain out of a molehill, and I have a garden to tend. And I really would like to know if this is going to involve… unpleasant tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I apologize if I’m causing you anxiety. I assure you, I’m not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. We just need to gather enough information to determine the cause of the black stool and ensure you receive the appropriate care. Now, could you please tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me see... My arthritis, of course. That’s always there. It aches, it’s stiff, it’s just… old age, really. And I get tired easily, but who doesn’t at my age? I've also had a bit of heartburn lately, but I usually just ignore that. It's probably something I ate. Other than that… no. I don't go around looking for symptoms, you know? I just live my life. Honestly, are you going to want a list of everything that slightly bothers me? This is absurd.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t need a list of everything that slightly bothers you, Dawnetta. Thank you for letting me know about the arthritis and heartburn. The heartburn is good to know. Now, let's talk about your medications. You mentioned taking pain pills for your arthritis. Can you tell me what the name of the medication is, and how much you take each day?
PATIENT: Ugh, the name? Honestly, I don’t even look at the bottles anymore. My husband handles all that. He gets them filled, puts them in those little pill organizers… I just take what he gives me. But… let me think. The bottle is orange. And… it has a picture of a flower on it? Oh, and it’s a big pill. A white pill. I think he said it started with a “N”... Naproxen, maybe? Is that it? And I take… two in the morning, and two at night. Sometimes three if it's a bad day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen, 2-3 times daily. That’s helpful. And have you noticed any side effects from taking the Naproxen, other than the black stool?
PATIENT: Side effects? Oh, goodness. Well, my stomach gets a bit upset sometimes. But I just take it with food. And I'm always a bit tired, but like I said, that's just old age. And… I think it makes me a little bit thirsty. Other than that… no. Honestly, I don't pay attention to every little thing that happens. I have a garden to tend, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't think so. Never had any problems. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And I can eat anything. I love a good apple pie. Honestly, I'm a pretty hardy person. I don't go around having reactions to things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the flu, oh, a few years back. And my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that too, a little blue one. And… I think I had a gallstone once, a long time ago. They took it out. Other than that… no. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension and a history of gallstone removal. And when did you have the gallstone removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago. Probably...oh, I don't know, thirty years ago? Maybe more. It was before my husband retired. He always remembers dates better than me. It was at the old hospital, the one downtown. Before they built the new one. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, thank you. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my mother had heart problems. She died when she was pretty old, though. And my father had… arthritis, I think. Just old age, really. And my brother… he had high blood pressure too. Everyone gets old, you know? It's not like there's some terrible family curse or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother, arthritis and hypertension in your brother. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Honestly? Gardening. That's my whole life. I spend hours out there, digging, planting, weeding… It's good exercise, I suppose. And I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables from my garden. And I drink a little bit of wine with dinner. Nothing too much. I don't smoke, never have. I'm a pretty simple person.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Another thing to delay my gardening show. Fine, go ahead. But don’t poke too much. I bruise easily, you know. And don't tell me anything terrible. I don't need to hear about all my ailments today. Get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Dawnetta. And I’ll only tell you what’s important. Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Your bowel sounds are normal. I did notice a little tenderness when I pressed on your upper abdomen. It's mild, but I want to take note of it. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular.
PATIENT: Tenderness?! Oh, great. What does that mean? Is it something serious? I knew it. This is what happens when you go to the doctor. They always find something wrong. Is it my stomach? Is it the pills? Don't tell me I need surgery. I am not having surgery.
DOCTOR: Now, now, let’s not jump to conclusions, Dawnetta. Mild tenderness doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It could be due to a number of things, including the Naproxen, or even just some gas. Given your black stools, tenderness, and history of taking Naproxen, I’d like to order a few tests to rule out any potential problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests?! Oh, honestly. Of course. Just what I needed. More delays. What kind of tests? Blood tests? A scan? Do I have to drink anything awful? And will they make me sick? I really don't have time for this, you know. I have tomatoes to stake and weeds to pull. But… fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. We'll try to make this as quick and easy as possible. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia and other issues. We’ll also do a stool test to check for blood. And, I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel to check kidney function and electrolytes. No awful drinks. Just a standard blood draw and a small stool sample. These tests will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on and rule out any potential problems. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Stool sample? You want me to collect my… stool? Oh, that’s just ridiculous. Absolutely not. I am not doing that. That's… degrading. My husband can do it. He's always cleaning up after the dog anyway. He can handle it. Honestly, this is getting worse and worse. And when will I get the results? I don't want to be waiting for weeks. I need to know something soon. My garden won't weed itself, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Dawnetta. Your husband can certainly collect the sample for you. We'll provide him with the necessary instructions and containers. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results. I expect we’ll have them back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor to help reduce the acid in your stomach. This may help with any potential irritation and inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: PPI? More pills. Honestly, I'm going to be rattling like a tin can soon. What does it do, exactly? And does it have side effects? I swear, one pill fixes one thing and causes ten more problems. If it makes me feel worse, I'm blaming you. And if it interferes with my gardening, I really blame you. Is it at least a small pill? Because I have trouble swallowing those big ones. My husband has to cut some of them in half. And...will it interact with my blood pressure medication? He's always worried about that. He's very meticulous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about taking another medication, Dawnetta. The PPI, called Omeprazole, helps reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. It can help heal any inflammation and prevent further irritation. It’s a relatively small pill, about 10mm in length. And as for interactions, there is a low risk of interaction with your blood pressure medication, but we will monitor your blood pressure closely when you come for your follow up appointment. The most common side effects are mild, such as headache, diarrhea, or constipation. But if you experience anything more serious, please let us know immediately. I will write the prescription for you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable...fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my gardening. And if my blood pressure goes up, I’m holding you personally responsible. And my husband will be very cross. He keeps a detailed log of everything I take. Very meticulous, like I said. Now, can we please be done? I have a tomato plant that’s starting to lean, and I really need to stake it before it falls over. I don’t want to lose any tomatoes. They're heirloom variety, you know. Very delicate.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. I understand. Here’s the prescription for the Omeprazole. The nurse will give you instructions on how to take it, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the test results and see how you’re feeling. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or significant changes in bowel habits, please go to the emergency room immediately. I hope you enjoy your gardening, and I hope the heirloom tomatoes flourish. Do you have any final questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just...thank you, I suppose. Although, I'm not entirely convinced this will help. But my husband insisted I come. He worries too much. And I really need to get back to my garden. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. You take care, and enjoy your gardening. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
