DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… quite lovely to meet you. Oh, dear. It’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it comes… well, it’s rather severe. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… lupus? Is that right? It feels connected to that, somehow. It's just all a bit… hazy, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit hazy. We'll try to clear it up together. You mentioned pain in your lower abdomen, coming and going, and a previous physician suggesting something about lupus. That’s a good starting point. First, let's focus on this pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Describe it… It’s… a cramping, really. A deep, aching cramp. And sometimes it feels like… a twisting? It’s difficult to explain. It starts low down, in my belly, and then it can spread a bit. It makes me feel quite nauseous, too, when it’s particularly bad. And… breathless, a little. Though I can’t be certain that’s connected. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Cramping, deep aching, twisting… spreading, and associated with nausea and sometimes breathlessness. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The start… That's a tricky one. It feels like… a long time ago, now. Years, certainly. But it wasn't constant, you see. It would come and go, a little twinge here and there. It’s really gotten worse… well, in the last few months, I’d say. More frequent, and much more intense. I think it started becoming more noticeable around springtime? Though I could be entirely mistaken. My memory… isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's been intermittent for years, but worsening over the last few months, possibly starting around springtime. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger… That’s another good question. It’s hard to say, truly. I haven't noticed anything consistent. Sometimes it seems to come after I’ve been… rather active, perhaps? A long walk, or gardening. But other times it comes when I’ve been perfectly still. I did have a rather stressful meeting a few weeks ago, and it flared up terribly afterwards, but I’m not sure if that was simply coincidence. Food doesn't seem to affect it, nor does the weather, as far as I can tell. It’s… rather unpredictable, I'm afraid. Which makes it all the more worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, not clearly linked to activity, stress, food, or weather. Now, Ms. Glymph, you mentioned your previous physician suggested lupus. Do you recall any other symptoms they discussed with you at that time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… They mentioned… fatigue, I believe. A great deal of fatigue. And… some joint pain. Mostly in my hands and wrists, I think. And… skin rashes, sometimes. Though they weren’t terribly prominent. Just… a little redness, here and there. And… sensitivity to sunlight, perhaps? It’s all rather vague, I’m sorry. They did run some tests, I remember, but I don't recall what they were looking for, specifically. It was quite some time ago, as I said. I believe they mentioned something about… antibodies? But I'm not a medical person, so it didn’t mean much to me at the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, joint pain in hands and wrists, skin rashes, sensitivity to sunlight, and something about antibodies. That gives us a good starting point. Before we proceed, Ms. Glymph, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! Let me see… I don’t believe so. I haven't knowingly had any allergic reactions. I’ve taken various medications over the years, of course – painkillers, antibiotics – and never experienced any trouble. I do have a slight sensitivity to certain perfumes, but that’s merely an irritation, not a true allergy. No, I don’t think I have any significant allergies, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, I am. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, as a preventative measure. My previous physician recommended it for… circulatory health, I believe. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, when the aspirin isn’t sufficient. But I try to avoid that as much as possible. And… oh! Yes, I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was a bit low on that. That's all, I think. Just the aspirin, occasional ibuprofen, and the vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin daily, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D supplement. Now, Ms. Glymph, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a bit of a complicated question. My mother… she had some sort of… autoimmune condition, I believe. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? Or something similar. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't terribly involved in her medical care. She passed away when I was quite young. My father… he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No significant medical issues. I have one sister, who is also… experiencing some fatigue, and joint pain, but she hasn't been formally diagnosed with anything. It's… rather vague on my side of the family, I'm afraid. Not a lot of clear-cut medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of autoimmune condition in your mother, and some similar symptoms in your sister. Now, Ms. Glymph, to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. Well, I'm… single. Never married. I’ve lived in this suburban area for… oh, goodness, almost forty years now. I retired from my work as a ship engineer about ten years ago. I keep myself busy with gardening, reading, and… occasional volunteer work at the local library. I have a few close friends, but I don't have a large social circle. I don't smoke, and I only drink alcohol very occasionally – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, once or twice a month. I live alone, but I have a lovely neighbour who checks in on me from time to time. It’s a quiet life, but I enjoy it. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Thank you. Alright, so, non-smoker, occasional alcohol, retired, quiet life. Now, Ms. Glymph, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your joints for tenderness. It will help me to better understand what might be causing your pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I'm quite comfortable with it. I’ve had physical examinations before, of course. It’s all a bit… daunting, but I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just… be gentle, perhaps? My abdomen can be a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Okay, Ms. Glymph, I'm noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen, primarily on the left side. It doesn’t feel like there are any masses, but you do exhibit some mild guarding when I press on that area. Your joints don't appear visibly swollen or red, but you do have some mild tenderness in your wrists and knuckles when I move them. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not significantly. Alright, Ms. Glymph. The examination confirms some tenderness in your abdomen and wrists. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the examination, it’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive diagnosis at this point. The symptoms you're describing – abdominal pain, fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes – could be indicative of several different conditions, including lupus, as your previous physician suggested, or other autoimmune disorders, or even conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. To further investigate, I would like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us to assess your inflammatory markers, check for antibodies associated with autoimmune disorders, and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. I understand that it's difficult to say for certain at this point. The uncertainty is… unsettling, but I suppose that’s to be expected. If it helps to clarify things, then please, proceed with the tests. I just… I hope it's not too serious. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly normal to feel unsettled when you're unsure of what's going on. We'll get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to manage your symptoms. Firstly, try to get plenty of rest. Fatigue is a significant symptom, and rest can help to alleviate that. Secondly, stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of fluids can help with digestion and overall well-being. Thirdly, avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your abdominal pain. And finally, if your pain becomes severe or is accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. I'm going to write you a requisition form for the blood tests. The lab is located just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly alright. Thank you. Rest, hydration, avoid strenuous activity… I can manage that. I appreciate your reassurance. It's… comforting to have a plan, even if it's just a preliminary one. Just… how long will it typically take for the results to come back? I suppose I should be prepared for a bit of a wait? And… is there anything I should ask the lab technician when I go? Anything specific I should mention?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Glymph. Typically, the results should be back within 3-5 business days. However, it can sometimes take a little longer, depending on the lab's workload. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. As for what to ask the lab technician, you can simply mention that I’ve requested a comprehensive autoimmune panel, including inflammatory markers and specific antibodies. You can also inform them that you have a history of fatigue and joint pain, as that may help them to prioritize your tests. But don't worry too much about it. They're very familiar with these types of requests. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. It's… reassuring to have someone listen, and to feel like I'm being taken seriously. Thank you again for your time. I'll go and get the blood tests done now, and I'll await your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns in the meantime. We're here to support you. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
