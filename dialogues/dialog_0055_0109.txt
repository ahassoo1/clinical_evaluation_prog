DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're ninety years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, ninety. Feels like yesterday, sometimes! My head... back of my head hurts. Been hurting for, oh... maybe three days now. Not a bad hurt, but... always there. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: A weight, you say. Hmm. And is this pain constant, Mr. Brum, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's... mostly there all the time. But sometimes it gets a little stronger. Like when I bend over, or if I get too warm. Not a sharp pain, never sharp. Just... heavy. Like someone is sitting on the back of my head. You understand?
DOCTOR: I believe I do. And has anything specific brought this on, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm... that's a good question. Not that I know of. I been working... you know, the rail yard. Same work I always do. Dinkey operator, mostly. Lifting, moving things... but I do that every day. Maybe… the sun? Been hotter than usual lately. I try to stay in the shade, but… it's hard.
DOCTOR: The heat, yes. Well, we’ll consider that. Now, Mr. Brum, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... let me think. No fever, I don't feel sick. Maybe a little tired, but I’m ninety, Doctor! Tired comes with the territory. No blurry vision, no dizziness… Oh! Sometimes, when I stand up too fast, everything swims for a second. But that happens sometimes anyway, you know? Old age. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It… contributes to the picture, Mr. Brum. Now, let's move on. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past problems... Well, I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. That healed good. And I had a bad cough, maybe twenty years ago. Doctor gave me some medicine, that fixed it. Nothing serious. My wife... she had the sugar sickness, but I didn't. I'm pretty strong, you see. Always been strong. I work hard.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Brum. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never had any surgeries. No. Never needed them. My wife... she had her appendix out, a long time ago. But me? No surgeries. I’m a strong man, remember? I heal quick. Always have. I think strong work keeps a man healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Brum, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a hard one. My family… we came from Guatemala, a long time ago. Lots of brothers and sisters. Most of them… they passed away already. Old age, mostly. I remember my father… he had trouble with his heart, near the end. And my mother… she got very weak. But… I don't know about any special sicknesses. We didn't have doctors much back then. We used herbs and… faith. Does that help? It's hard to remember so far back.
DOCTOR: It… provides some information, Mr. Brum. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Never had any. I can take most anything. My wife… she was allergic to some kind of flower, made her sneeze a lot. But me? No. I eat everything. I drink everything. I'm a strong man, remember? Strong stomach. Never had trouble.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Never needed them. I take a little bit of chamomile tea sometimes, to help me sleep. But that's just tea. My wife… she took pills for her sugar sickness. But me? No. I’m a strong man. I don’t need pills. I work hard and that keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick examination then, Mr. Brum. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your neurological function. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'm a little stiff, you know. Old age. But I'll try my best. You just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though a little diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are… diminished, but present bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Eye movements are intact. Strength appears normal bilaterally, though somewhat diminished overall. Alright, Mr. Brum. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing tension headaches, potentially exacerbated by heat and exertion. However, given your age, and the persistent nature of the headache, I'd like to order a CT scan of the head to rule out any underlying structural issues.
PATIENT: A CT scan? What’s that? Is that… dangerous? I don't like machines much. Is it expensive? I don't have much money, Doctor. I just want something for the headache. Maybe a little pill? Something to take when it gets bad? I work hard, you see. I can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: A CT scan, Mr. Brum, is an imaging test that takes pictures of your brain. It’s not particularly dangerous, though it does involve a small amount of radiation. It’s the best way to be certain about the cause of your headache. And yes, it can be expensive. Given your lack of insurance, we can discuss options for financial assistance at the billing office. However, I understand your concerns. While a pill might alleviate the symptoms temporarily, it won't address the underlying cause. We need to rule out anything serious before simply masking the pain. I’m hesitant to prescribe medication without knowing what we're dealing with. Given your age and the fact that you’ve been working steadily for decades, it's likely nothing serious. But we must be thorough. We can start with blood work to rule out any systemic issues. And I will write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, just to tide you over while we await the results of the blood work and discuss the possibility of a CT scan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… that sounds okay. Not too scary. And a little pill… yes, that would be good. Just something to help when it hurts. I don't want to cause trouble. I just want to keep working. Financial assistance… you’ll help me with that? I don’t have family to help. My wife… she’s gone now. Okay, Doctor. Blood work and a little pill. And you’ll help me with the money for the scan? That would be very kind. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly explore financial assistance options for the CT scan. Our billing department will be in touch. The lab order is for a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. They will draw some blood, and the results should be available within a few days. Take this prescription to the pharmacy, and go to the lab as soon as possible. If the headache worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms – such as vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Pharmacy and lab. And if it gets worse… emergency room. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you helping me. I just want to keep working, you see. It’s all I have. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Brum. Get well soon. .
PATIENT: .
