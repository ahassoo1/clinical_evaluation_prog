DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's my nails. They just… look funny now. Not like they used to, ya know? I don't really remember when they started lookin’ this way, just…now. They're kinda…off.
DOCTOR: Okay, “kinda off.” That’s a good starting point. Could you describe what you mean by "off"?
PATIENT: Well, they're… not shiny. And kinda thick. Not like pretty nails. More… bumpy. I used to get them done, but not for a long time. Maybe that has somethin’ to do with it? I dunno. Everything's just… blurry these days, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to not remember specifics, especially when something has been gradual. Not getting your nails done for a while could definitely be a factor, but there are other possibilities as well. So, the changes you've noticed are a lack of shine and a thickening, with some bumps. Have you noticed any changes around your nails – any redness, swelling, pain, or separation from the nail bed?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Sometimes a little… sensitive if I hit them on somethin’. But not pain. Redness… maybe a little around the edges? Hard to say. My fingers are always cold, ya know? Makes everything look kinda funny. I don't think they're… swollen, though. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant swelling or pain, just some sensitivity when bumped and maybe a little redness around the edges, potentially due to cold fingers. And the changes have been gradual. Let's take a closer look. Would you mind if I examined your nails and hands?
PATIENT: Uhh, fine. Whatever. Just… be gentle, okay? I don't like bein' poked and prodded. I don’t know why I even bother comin’ to doctors, they always make somethin’ outta nothin’.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Ms. Thut. I promise. And I understand your concern – it’s always best to rule things out and get a clear understanding of what's going on. Okay, I’m seeing some thickening of the nails, particularly on the big toes and index fingers. The color is a bit dull, as you mentioned, and I do see some mild ridging. There's some dryness around the cuticles, and a little bit of inflammation. I don't feel any significant tenderness when I gently press on the nail beds. Based on what I’m seeing, it appears you might have a mild fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It's quite common, especially with changes in circulation or prolonged exposure to moisture. However, to confirm this, I’d like to send a small clipping from a couple of your nails to the lab for a culture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh, great. Just what I needed. I knew it would be somethin’. Moisture? Where would I even get moisture? I don’t swim or nothin’. Lab? You gotta… cut my nails? I don't like that. Is there another way? Can’t you just… tell by lookin’? I don’t need no fancy tests. Sounds expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. It’s frustrating to deal with this, and I apologize if it feels like a lot of steps. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to definitively diagnose a fungal infection just by looking at the nails. Other conditions can look similar – like psoriasis or even just nail damage from trauma. A lab culture is the most accurate way to confirm the diagnosis and ensure we're treating the right thing. Regarding the clipping – it's a very small piece of the nail, just a tiny fragment. It won’t cause any discomfort, I assure you. And it’s usually covered by insurance, particularly Medicare. We can check your coverage details to be sure, of course. If we don’t confirm a fungal infection, we can explore other possibilities. But it's best to have a definite answer before starting any treatment. Would you be willing to let me take a small clipping?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. And small, you hear? I don’t want to be walkin’ around with half my nails gone. And you better check that insurance thing. I’m not payin’ a fortune for a little bit of nail. Honestly, doctors these days… always gotta do somethin’. What did people do before all these tests?
DOCTOR: See?
PATIENT: That’s…tiny. Okay. Get it over with. And don’t poke me. Seriously. This whole thing is ridiculous. What's the wait time on these “results” anyway? I don't wanna be comin’ back here a million times.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. The lab typically takes about two to three weeks to process the culture. We can call you with the results as soon as they are available. And I assure you, Ms. Thut, we'll only need you to come back if treatment is necessary. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d recommend keeping your nails trimmed and dry, and avoiding anything that could irritate them. Do you have any questions for me in the meantime?
PATIENT: Trimmed and dry... right. I don't know... Is it contagious? Like, will I give it to somebody? My grandkids come visit sometimes... I wouldn't want them gettin' somethin' from me. That’s probably a silly question, huh? Everything just feels… icky. I just wanna get rid of it, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Thut, and not silly at all. Fungal nail infections can be contagious, though it’s not highly contagious. It typically spreads through close contact, so things like sharing nail clippers or walking barefoot in communal showers can increase the risk. To minimize any potential spread, it’s a good idea to avoid sharing nail clippers or files, and to keep your feet and hands clean and dry. If you have any cuts or breaks in the skin, that's also a good time to be extra cautious. It's also a good idea to have your grandkids wash their hands after visiting, just as a general precaution. We’ll know more once we have the lab results. Do you have any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: Wash their hands... Ugh. Alright. No, I think that’s it. Just...get the results back quickly, okay? I don’t want this hangin' over my head forever. And don’t try to sell me any fancy creams or potions. I've had enough of doctors tryin’ to upsell me on things I don’t need. I just want normal nails, ya know? Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Thut. Normal nails – that’s a perfectly reasonable request. I promise to keep you updated as soon as we have the results, and I assure you, I won't try to upsell you on anything. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any changes or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was lovely meeting you today. I hope you have a good rest of your day.
