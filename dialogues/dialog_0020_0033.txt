DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this appointment. Something about my eyes and ears… failing, she said. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have patients waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when appointments feel unexpected. Let’s try to clarify things. You mentioned something about your eyes and ears… could you tell me a little more about what's been bothering you with those?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Well, everything is rather…dim, isn’t it? And sounds… muffled. It came on quite suddenly, I believe. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I suppose that’s the age, isn’t it? It’s just… unsettling to not be able to see properly when one is a surgeon. It’s rather important, wouldn’t you agree? And the noises... everything sounds like it’s underwater.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Being able to see and hear clearly is critical, especially in your profession. And sudden changes are always something we need to investigate. Just to be sure I have a complete picture, has this been accompanied by any dizziness, headaches, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? No, not that I recall. Though, there is a persistent… fuzziness. It’s difficult to describe. And dizziness… well, I sometimes feel a little unsteady on my feet, but that's likely just getting older, isn’t it? I haven't had a proper headache in decades, thank goodness. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to know if this is something that will interfere with my practice. That's all that truly matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your practice, Ms. Julie. We'll do our best to figure out what's going on. Let's move on to some other questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your balance lately, other than just feeling a little unsteady?
PATIENT: Balance… well, I haven’t tripped, if that’s what you mean. Though, young nurses these days are so clumsy, I often have to steady them! I suppose I might be a bit more careful in my steps… one must be, you know, with all the commotion in the hospital. It’s a very busy place. Really, I can’t say I’ve noticed any particular change. Is this truly relevant, Doctor? I have a very important surgery scheduled for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Julie, just trying to gather all the information. It's good you haven't tripped, that’s positive. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I do a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But do be quick about it, Doctor. My time is… precious. I haven’t the patience for prolonged examinations. And please, be gentle. I have delicate hands, you know. Essential for my work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'd like to check your ears with an otoscope. Then, I'll do a basic neurological exam, checking your balance and reflexes. And finally, a quick eye exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it. But do be careful with the instruments. Honestly, the standards of cleanliness these days… I worry about infection. And please, no surprises. I dislike surprises. Proceed, Doctor. But quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to look inside your ears with this light. This won’t be uncomfortable. Okay, the ear canals appear clear, no signs of wax buildup or infection. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… could you please sit here and cross your legs?
PATIENT: Get on with it, Doctor. Honestly, I've been poked and prodded enough for one afternoon. This is… undignified. I’m a surgeon, not a… a specimen.
DOCTOR: Just a quick check, Ms. Julie. Okay, reflexes are a bit diminished, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. And then touch my finger with your finger. This checks your coordination.
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, I fail to see the relevance of these… childish games. I’ve performed hundreds of intricate surgeries, and this is what you’re concerned about? My coordination is excellent. It has to be. My patients depend on it. Now, can we please be done? I’m already running late.
DOCTOR: Okay, just one more quick check, Ms. Julie. I’m going to shine this light in your eyes. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but… somewhat sluggish. Ms. Julie, based on this brief exam – the diminished reflexes, sluggish pupils, and slight coordination issues – I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. It's too early to say definitively, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Neurological issue? Nonsense! I assure you, Doctor, my brain is perfectly functional. I am a highly respected surgeon! I can recall complex anatomical structures and perform delicate procedures with ease. This is… preposterous. Are you suggesting I am… incompetent? Because I assure you, I am not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have patients waiting. I suggest you re-evaluate your assessment. Perhaps you need more coffee, Doctor? Or a vacation? I fail to see how any of this is relevant to my practice. This is a waste of my time. A complete waste. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I am not questioning your skill as a surgeon. However, these findings, even if subtle, warrant further investigation to rule out any potential underlying cause. It’s not about competence, it’s about patient safety. Given the sudden onset of your symptoms, and these exam findings, I strongly recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out a stroke or other serious condition. And I would recommend postponing your surgery until we have the results. Waiting for the scan is the safer course of action. Would you be willing to schedule one?
