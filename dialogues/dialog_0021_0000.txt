DOCTOR: Right, Sharifa Firestone. 44 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They just…gave out. Not all at once, exactly. It started a few days ago, after I had a really bad cold. Just felt weak, you know? But now…walking is just difficult. It's quite inconvenient, honestly.
DOCTOR: Weakness…after a cold. Hmm. Difficult walking, you say. Okay. Can you describe what you mean by “gave out”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It’s not like I collapsed or anything dramatic. It’s more…like trying to wade through molasses. Heavy, slow. Like there’s no spring in my step. And it’s both legs, equally. It’s just… frustrating. I used to be quite nimble. I am a tour guide, you know. Walking is rather important.
DOCTOR: Tour guide… right. That is important. So, both legs, equal weakness, feeling heavy and slow. And this started a few days after your cold cleared up?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The cold itself was awful – the usual, stuffy nose, sore throat, headache. But that’s gone now. Completely. It's just…this lingering weakness. It’s not painful, not really. Just…unsettling. And, frankly, a bit embarrassing. I had to ask a colleague to help me carry some brochures yesterday. Brochures, can you imagine?
DOCTOR: Right. No pain, just weakness… after a cold. Let’s see… have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. Never. I’ve always been perfectly healthy. I eat reasonably well – mostly. I do a lot of walking, as I said. And I rarely get sick. This is… new. And rather unwelcome, I assure you. It's not like I have time for illnesses. I have a tour scheduled for next week, a rather prestigious one, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, when you say "reasonably well," what does that look like on a typical day?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually just coffee. I’m not much of a morning person. Lunch… depends. Sometimes a sandwich if I’m on the go, sometimes leftovers. Dinner is usually the most substantial meal – fish, chicken, rice, vegetables… I try to have a salad. It's not gourmet, but it’s not bad. And, as I said, I walk a lot. It keeps me fit. I just don’t understand where this weakness came from.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do you have any trouble with balance?
PATIENT: Balance? No, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. I feel a little unsteady sometimes, like I need to concentrate more when I’m walking on uneven ground. But nothing major. It’s just… tiring, you know? I have to think about walking now, which is ridiculous. I used to just do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a look at your legs. Just want to check your reflexes and strength. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s a little… wobbly, if you don’t mind. But I can manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I don’t want to fall and cause a scene. Honestly, this is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course. No need to worry, I'm right here. Just relax. Let’s start with a simple squat. If that’s too much, we can do something else. Just tell me if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable. And no worries about undignified, that’s what I’m here for. Now, can you try to squat down as if you’re sitting in a chair?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…difficult. It feels like my legs are going to give out. It’s not painful, exactly, but… weak. Very weak. It's worse than I thought. You were right to ask. It feels like I need to use my arms to help me. Which is… embarrassing. And not a good sign, is it? I feel… rather foolish, actually. .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to push it. That's good to know. Let's try sitting back down. Okay, just rest here for a moment. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to tap just below your kneecap with this little hammer. It's not going to hurt, just a quick tap. Okay?
