DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. My name is Jammal Goodstein. I am here because… well, it is a little embarrassing, but I have a lot of… gas. A lot. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it is… disruptive. I hope that explains things.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes, I understand. It’s good you came in to talk about it, Mr. Goodstein. It's certainly not something to be embarrassed about – digestive issues are quite common. "A little while now," you say... could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, in… March. So, about five months now. Maybe a little longer. It was not so bad at first, just a little bubbling. But now… now it is quite frequent. Especially after I eat. Though sometimes it happens even when I haven’t eaten anything for a while. It’s… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly five months, starting in March, and gradually getting worse. More noticeable after eating, but also happening at other times. And unpredictable, you said. Is it associated with any particular foods, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: That is a very good question, Doctor. I have been trying to figure that out myself. I do not think so, really. I eat… mostly simple things. Burgers, fries… sometimes a hot dog. I work at the fast food place, you see. I eat what we sell. I have tried… well, I tried not eating the beans one day, and it did not seem to make a difference. And I like pickles, but even when I avoid pickles, it still happens. So, no, I do not think a specific food causes it. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. Burgers, fries, hot dogs… pickles. Eating what you sell at work. And you’ve tried eliminating some things – beans, pickles – with no real change. Hmm. Is it painful at all, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, not exactly painful. It is… uncomfortable. Bloated, you know? Like I have a balloon inside of me. And sometimes… sometimes it makes my stomach rumble very loudly. That is the embarrassing part! But no real pain, Doctor. Just… unpleasant. And it smells… well, it is not a pleasant smell.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable, bloated, rumbling, and… noticeable odor. I understand. It sounds quite distressing, even if it's not painful. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this gas?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Thinking about it… sometimes my stomach feels a little… loose. Not diarrhea, exactly. But softer than it should be, you know? And I go to the bathroom more often than I used to. Just a little bit more, not a big change, but… noticeable. And I feel a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours, so that could be anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so looser stools, increased frequency of bowel movements, and some fatigue. And you work long hours, which could contribute to the tiredness. Have you had any weight loss recently, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not lost any weight. Maybe a little bit, but I think that is just because it is warm outside and I do not eat as much when it is hot. I am… pretty steady, weight-wise. I think I weigh about the same as always.
DOCTOR: Alright. No weight loss. Okay, Mr. Goodstein, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel around gently. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want this… problem… to go away.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just change into the gown, we'll get started. I’ll listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, then just gently feel around. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. I'll explain what I'm doing as I go along. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, if you could lie back on the exam table. Okay… bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, and they seem… a little hyperactive, a bit louder than usual. No tenderness to palpation, no masses. It is a little…distended, but not significantly. Okay, everything feels relatively normal to the touch. No guarding or rebound tenderness.
