DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. Well, it's this queasy feeling I've been havin' o' a mornings, see. Not a proper sickness, mind ye, more like… a turnin' in me stomach before I've even had a bite o' breakfast. It’s been goin’ on for a couple o' weeks now, and I thought I best get it checked, given… well, given the heart's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A “queasy feeling,” you say. And it occurs specifically before breakfast, not after?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Before. Usually wakes me up with it, actually. Not a sharp pain, just… unsettled. If I eat somethin' quick – a biscuit, maybe – it settles a bit, but it's still there underneath. It’s just… worrisome, ye ken? Never had this before with the heart trouble.
DOCTOR: "Heart trouble," you mentioned. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Och, aye. It was diagnosed… let me think now… about seven years ago, I suppose. Congestive heart failure, the doctor said. I take medication for it, three times a day. Keeps it mostly under control, thankfully. I get a bit short o' breath if I overdo it, and me ankles swell a bit in the heat, but overall… I manage. But this nausea... it feels different, and I dinna want it to be somethin' with the heart. I’ve never had me stomach do this before, not like this.
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure… three medications… Alright. And these medications are…?
PATIENT: Let me see... there's Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Then there's… Carvedilol, that's 12.5 milligrams, twice a day. And finally, Furosemide, 40 milligrams, every mornin'. I try to be regular with them, but sometimes… well, sometimes I forget, I suppose. But I dinna think that's it, not this time. The forgetfulness is just… old age creepin’ in, I reckon. But the pills are usually taken, I assure ye.
DOCTOR: "Old age," indeed. Alright, Mr. Benic. Now, besides the heart failure medications, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Och, now, let me think… No, not really. Just the pills, and a multivitamin every now and then, just to be safe, ye ken? I try to eat well, mostly fish and vegetables. I used to take somethin' for me joints, a glucosamine chondroitin tablet, but I stopped that a while back. Didn’t seem to be doin' much good. Nothin' else, Doctor. Honest. I'm a simple man, I dinna like to fill me body with things it doesna need.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had a reaction to anythin', not even as a wee lad. I can eat shellfish, take penicillin… all o' it. Me mother always said I had a cast iron stomach, though this mornin'… well, it feels a bit less cast iron than usual! But truly, Doctor, no allergies to speak o'. I’ve always been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I try to eat healthy. Mostly fish, maybe salmon or cod a couple o' times a week. Lots o’ vegetables - potatoes, carrots, peas, that sort o’ thing. I do enjoy a wee bit o' red meat now and then, a steak maybe on a Sunday, but I try not to overdo it. I drink a good bit o' water, and I’ve cut back on the biscuits, though I still sneak one with me tea. I used to eat more salt, but the doctor told me to watch that, so I’ve been tryin’ to use less in me cookin’. Overall, I’d say it’s a decent diet. Not fancy, but healthy enough.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke or drink alcohol, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Och, no, no smokin' for me, Doctor. Never had the habit. Me father smoked, and it weren’t a pretty sight. I’ve always steered clear o’ it. As for the drink… I used to enjoy a pint o’ bitter down at the pub on a Friday, maybe two. But I’ve cut right back on that, too. It just doesn't seem to agree with me anymore, especially with the heart. Now I maybe have a small glass o' sherry with me dinner once a week, if that. Very small, mind ye. It’s more for the taste than anythin’ else. I’m not one for gettin’ tipsy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to your bowels. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Och… well now, that’s a… personal question, isn’t it? Let me see… it’s been… regular enough, I suppose. Not as… firm as it used to be, maybe. And a wee bit more frequent these past few weeks. But nothin' drastic, mind ye. Just… a change. Could be the diet, I reckon. Or… well, things happen as ye get older, don’t they? I’m not one to complain, Doctor. But aye, there's been a bit o' a change, if ye must know. Not worryin’ enough to see a doctor over, usually, but… I'm tellin' ye everythin' now, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any recent weight loss or fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that, Doctor. No weight loss, I've actually been holdin’ steady, maybe even put on a wee bit ‘round the middle, if I’m honest. No fever, no chills, and certainly no night sweats. I sleep sound enough, though I do get up a couple o’ times to use the… facilities, as ye say. But that's just a part o' gettin' older, I reckon. Everything’s been pretty normal on that front, thankfully. Just this queasiness, that’s the main worry. It's just… unnervin', with me heart and all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Benic. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination now, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and palpating your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I dinna mind a bit o' proddin' and pokin', if it’ll help. I’ve had me heart listened to a fair few times, so I’m used to it. Just let me know if ye feel anything unusual, and I’ll tell ye if it hurts. I'm a patient man, I promise. Just get on with it, and hopefully, we’ll get to the bottom o’ this queasiness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Heart sounds are… regular rate, but slightly diminished. There’s a faint murmur, consistent with previous findings. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with some mild crackles in the bases, also consistent with previous findings. Now, your abdomen… slightly tender to palpation in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are… present in all quadrants, but slightly hyperactive. Alright. I’ll also check your ankles for edema. Mild pitting edema present bilaterally, consistent with congestive heart failure. Blood pressure is 140/85. Pulse is 72. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on my examination, Mr. Benic, your symptoms could be related to a number of factors. The nausea, combined with the slight abdominal tenderness, could indicate a mild gastrointestinal issue, perhaps gastritis. However, given your history of congestive heart failure, we must also consider the possibility that your symptoms are related to fluid retention or reduced cardiac output. The crackles in your lungs and edema in your ankles suggest that your heart failure may be somewhat decompensated.
PATIENT: Och. That sounds… complicated, Doctor. Decompensated, ye say? Is that bad? And gastritis… is that somethin’ I need pills for? I'm startin' to worry now, to be honest. I was hopin’ it was just somethin’ simple, like a bad egg or somethin’. So, what do we do now? Are we talkin’ more pills, or… a hospital stay? I dinna fancy a hospital stay, not at me age.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Mr. Benic. "Decompensated" simply means that your heart failure is not as well controlled as it should be. It doesn't necessarily require hospitalization, at this time. However, it does warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a B-type natriuretic peptide, or BNP, level. The CBC will rule out any infection, the BMP will assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and the BNP will help us determine the severity of your heart failure. We will also order a stool test to rule out any gastrointestinal infection, and perhaps a Helicobacter pylori test to determine if gastritis is the culprit. Finally, I will request an updated echocardiogram, to assess your heart’s function. As for the pills, we will hold off on any new medications until we have the results of these tests. However, I do strongly recommend that you adhere strictly to your current medication regimen and reduce your salt intake even further. I will also give you a prescription for a mild antacid, to help alleviate your nausea in the meantime. It's important to monitor your weight daily, and if you notice any sudden weight gain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs, you must contact me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, that's… a lot to take in, Doctor. A fair few tests, then. But I understand. Strict with the pills, less salt, watch me weight… and contact ye if things get worse. The antacid sounds good, thank ye. And what about the results? How long will that take? I dinna like bein' in the dark, know what I mean? And what if… what if it is somethin’ serious? Just tellin’ me straight, like. I can handle it. It's just… I’m an old man, Doctor, and I’d like to know what I’m up against.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Benic. You are entitled to know exactly what to expect. The blood tests and stool test should be available within 48 to 72 hours. The echocardiogram will take a bit longer, perhaps a week or so, as we need to schedule it with the radiology department. Now, regarding your concerns about a serious condition… it’s possible that your symptoms are indicative of a more advanced stage of heart failure, or that there is another underlying medical problem contributing to your discomfort. However, it's equally possible that this is a mild exacerbation of your current condition, or a simple gastrointestinal issue that can be easily treated with medication and lifestyle changes. I want to assure you that we are taking all necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide you with the best possible care. I will personally review the results of all tests and contact you immediately to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, please adhere strictly to my recommendations. Monitor your weight, take your medications as prescribed, and contact me if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any further questions, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Och… aye. That's… reassuring, I suppose. Thank ye, Doctor. No, I dinna think I have any more questions right now. Just gettin’ me head around all the tests, that's all. I'll keep a close watch on me weight, and I'll take the pills regular. And I'll phone ye if things get worse, I promise. Thank ye for takin’ the time to listen to an old man complain, Doctor. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll be on me way then. And thank ye again, for the antacid prescription. I might need it this mornin’!
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Benic. You are welcome. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. And do try to rest. .
