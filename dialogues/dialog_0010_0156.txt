DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, good morning! It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Annesley. Um... well, it’s my stomach, really. It’s been… off. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and honestly, I'm just tired of it. I think it might be something to do with… something I have? A doctor told me about it a while back, something about my insides not liking certain foods. Does that make sense? I don't really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It sounds like you might be referring to a food sensitivity or intolerance, like lactose intolerance or perhaps something else. Let's try to narrow it down. When did this diarrhea start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a good question. Honestly, time is a bit blurry for me lately. But I think… maybe a few weeks ago? It started slowly, just a little bit upset, and then it got worse. It comes and goes, but it's been pretty consistent for… at least a couple of weeks, I guess. It’s hard to say exactly. I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jase. It's perfectly alright. We'll figure it out. And it’s good you're seeking help. Can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Um… well, it’s… watery, definitely. And… frequent. Like, I have to go to the bathroom a lot. Sometimes it’s just a little bit, sometimes it’s… more. And it's… uncomfortable, obviously. And sometimes I feel really tired after. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s just… not normal. I keep having to cancel plans because of it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Watery, frequent stools, feeling fatigued afterwards… those are all helpful details. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I’ve tried to think about it. I think… sometimes it's after I eat bread? Or pasta? Things with wheat in them, I guess. But not always. Sometimes I can eat it and be fine. And sometimes even things without wheat seem to bother me. It's really confusing. My husband tries to help me remember, but… he’s not always sure either. He just knows I'm not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Okay, inconsistent triggers… that’s important information. It does sound like a food intolerance is a strong possibility, but the inconsistency makes it harder to pinpoint. Besides the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes my stomach feels bloated, really full and uncomfortable. And… I think I've been a bit more tired than usual, even when I'm not having diarrhea. Not just sleepy, but… weak, maybe? It’s hard to explain. And… I think I've lost a little bit of weight, but I haven't really been weighing myself regularly. My clothes feel a bit looser, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating, fatigue, and possible weight loss. Those are all things we need to consider. I see here you're 176 centimeters tall and weigh 86 kilograms. Has there been a significant change in your weight recently, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sorry, I forgot to mention that! My husband says I've lost a few kilos in the last month or so. I haven’t weighed myself, but he noticed. He gets worried, you know? He’s very observant. He said I look thinner, and… I guess I do feel it in my clothes, like you said. It’s not a lot of weight, but enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, a doctor told me a while ago about something with my insides, like I said before. He talked about… I think it was celiac disease? Or Crohn’s disease? Something like that. He did some tests, and he said I was… sensitive to gluten, I think. But he didn’t really explain it very well, and I don’t remember everything. I’ve tried to avoid gluten as much as possible since then, but… honestly, it’s been hard. I get confused about what has gluten in it. And sometimes I slip up. Does that make sense? It was a long time ago, and I don't really recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you had some initial testing for celiac disease, but it wasn’t definitive. We'll need to revisit that. Do you remember what tests were done?
PATIENT: Um… I think it was a blood test? And maybe something to do with a… a little tube they put down my throat? It was a while ago, and I was really nervous, so I don’t remember much. I just remember the doctor saying I should avoid gluten. He didn't explain the results very well, and I honestly just tried to follow his advice as best as I could. It was a lot to take in, and I didn't really understand everything. I was so young, I think, and I just wanted to get out of there. My husband was with me, but he mostly just listened. He's better at remembering things than me, but I don't want to bother him with it now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. We can certainly look into it further. It's good you recall some testing was done. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just a basic one. And if I get a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that’s about it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I’m not a big fan of medications, honestly. My husband is the one who reminds me to take the multivitamin sometimes. He's very good at keeping track of things like that. He always worries about me not getting enough vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always asks me that when I get sick, and I always say no. I think if I was allergic to something, I would know by now, right? I mean, I eat a lot of different things. He worries about me trying new foods, but I like to try everything once. He gets nervous, but I haven't had any problems yet.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as digestive issues, autoimmune diseases, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family is… pretty big, and we don’t really talk about medical stuff much. My grandmother on my mother’s side had some stomach problems, I think. But I don’t really know what kind. And my uncle on my father’s side has something with his joints, but I don’t know if that’s relevant. I think my mom said something about diabetes on my father’s side, but honestly, I don’t remember the details. My family is really spread out, and we don’t see each other very often, so I don’t really know much about their medical histories. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It’s helpful to know what you do know. Finally, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. It smells bad and it’s bad for your health, everyone says. My husband doesn’t smoke either. We both try to stay healthy, as much as we can. He's really good at reminding me to eat my vegetables. He's a very health-conscious person. He worries about me a lot, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Um… not much. We have a glass of wine sometimes with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. It's mostly my husband who drinks it, I just have a little sip. I don't really like the taste that much, to be honest. He likes to try different kinds of wine, and I just go along with it. It's more of a social thing, I think. We both try to keep it to a minimum, as much as we can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, tell me a little bit about your stress levels. Are you currently experiencing any significant stress in your life?
PATIENT: Um… well, I wouldn’t say I’m super stressed, but… things have been a bit hectic lately. I'm trying to keep up with work, and… things at home. It's nothing major, just… a lot to juggle. And the diarrhea definitely doesn't help! It makes everything more stressful. I worry about having to cancel plans, and… just feeling sick all the time. My husband is really supportive, but… I still feel bad when I have to miss things. I think it’s just a general feeling of being overwhelmed, you know? Like, I’m trying to do too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a good overall picture. Based on what you’ve told me – the chronic diarrhea, the possible gluten sensitivity, the weight loss, and your stress levels – I think we need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out celiac disease and other potential causes of your diarrhea. We should also run a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Anything to figure out what's going on. I'm just tired of feeling sick all the time. And I really want to be able to eat normal food again! So, yes, blood tests and a… a stool sample, whatever you think is best. My husband will be glad to hear we're getting to the bottom of it. He's always worried about me, you know? He'll probably drive me to the lab himself. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests?
DOCTOR: That's a great attitude, Jase. And that’s very kind of your husband. For the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – so no eating or drinking anything except water. As for the stool sample, the lab will give you specific instructions, but generally, you’ll collect a small sample using a kit they provide. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to get an accurate result. I’ll have the nurses give you the kits and the paperwork you need. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That sounds manageable. Fasting and… collecting a sample. It's not ideal, but… if it helps, I'll do it. I just hope we can figure out what's going on soon. My husband will be relieved to hear we have a plan. He's always so worried about me getting enough nutrients. Thank you, Dr. Annesley. I really appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get those tests ordered and get you scheduled. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss the next steps. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll have the nurse come in to review the instructions with you now.
