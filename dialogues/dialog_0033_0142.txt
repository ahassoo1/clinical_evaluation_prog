DOCTOR: Right. Jaxston Lawther, 22. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's… my head. It's been giving me trouble again. Really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart races, you know? Like, thump-thump-thump. It's… hard to explain, exactly. It just feels awful. I’ve had them on and off for a while now, but they’ve been worse lately.
DOCTOR: "On and off for a while," is… not particularly helpful. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Um… let me think. It's been… maybe six months? Or was it longer? Time kinda blurs, honestly. They used to be, like, once a month, maybe. Now it's… two or three times a week, sometimes? It's hard to keep track. They don't all feel the same either. Some are just… a really bad pressure, and others… others feel like someone's squeezing my head. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Squeezing. Right. And these episodes… how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a good question. Usually… a few hours, I guess? Sometimes it's just an hour, but a couple of times they've stuck around most of the day. It makes it really hard to get anything done. I end up just lying down in a dark room. It’s… it’s pretty rough. I don't really remember exactly how long they last each time, to be honest. It all feels like one long headache sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're… not providing a great deal of useful information, Mr. Lawther. Let's try this. Any other symptoms during these headaches?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. Sometimes I get a bit nauseous, kinda queasy. Not like, throwing-up queasy, but just… feeling sick to my stomach. And things seem… brighter, you know? Like, lights bother me more when I have a headache. And sounds too, kinda. Everything just feels… too much. Oh! And sometimes I feel dizzy, a little unsteady on my feet. Does that help? I'm trying to remember everything. It's just… a lot going on in my head, literally.
DOCTOR: Bright lights, sounds… dizziness. Alright. Any family history of migraines or similar headaches?
PATIENT: Migraines… huh. My mom… she used to get bad headaches, yeah. Really bad ones. She’d always complain about them. But… I don’t know if they were migraines, exactly. She never really went to the doctor much. And my dad… he didn’t really have any health problems, as far as I know. Honestly, I don't really talk about that stuff with my family much. We’re not really close, you know? So, I’m not sure if anyone else had them. Sorry. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Social history, then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. Don't like it. And… uh… I don’t really drink much either. Maybe a beer now and then with friends, but nothing serious. I work, you know? Production work. Mostly just… physical stuff. Not a lot of time for… anything, really. Been divorced for about a year now. It’s… been rough. But that's… separate. I don't think that has anything to do with my head.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. I had some penicillin as a kid, I remember that, but I don't recall having any reaction to it. And… I haven't really taken much medication since then, to be honest. Just… over-the-counter stuff for colds and aches, you know? Nothing strong. I’m pretty careful about what I take. I don’t like feeling… weird. So, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But I can’t say for sure, I guess. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Lie back on the examination table. I'll need to check your reflexes and do a basic neurological exam. Don’t anticipate this being overly informative, frankly.
PATIENT: Okay… sure. Whatever you need. It’s… a little nerve-wracking, honestly. I don't really do well with doctors, if I'm being honest. But I appreciate you trying to figure it out. I just want it to stop, you know? This headache… it's really getting to me. Let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Strength 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation intact. Neurological exam is unremarkable. Which, given your vague history, isn't terribly surprising. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse 72. Temperature normal.
PATIENT: Unremarkable… is that good? I mean, is that… a good thing? It just feels like something's wrong, you know? Even if you can't find anything. I get these headaches, and they're awful. It’s just… frustrating. What do we do now? Are we going to… get some tests? Or… I don't know. I’m just hoping for some answers.
DOCTOR: "Unremarkable" means we haven't identified an obvious neurological deficit. Given your lack of specific symptoms and a normal exam, the most likely explanation is tension headaches. Here. This is a handout on managing tension headaches. Avoid stress, stay hydrated, over-the-counter pain relievers. If they worsen or you develop new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness – then, and only then, should you return. I’m not convinced further investigation is warranted at this time. I suggest you attempt these measures for a month and see if there is improvement.
PATIENT: Tension headaches… that’s it? After all this… just tension? I mean, I do get stressed, I guess. Work’s pretty tough. But it just feels like… more than that. It’s… scary, when they hit. But… okay. I’ll try. I guess. A month… Alright. And… if they get worse, I should come back? Even if I can’t explain it really well? I just… don’t want to be brushed off if something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: "Worse" is a subjective term, Mr. Lawther. Significant neurological changes – weakness, vision loss, speech difficulties – necessitate immediate attention. A slightly increased headache intensity does not. I’m providing you with a reasonable course of action based on the information you've given me. The lack of insurance complicates matters, frankly. .
PATIENT: …Right. Okay. Significant changes. I’ll… remember that. Complicated matters… Just tension… yeah. Right. .
