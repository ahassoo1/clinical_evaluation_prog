DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yeah, hi. Look, it's… it's my stomach. Been bleedin', pretty nasty stuff, actually. Not a pleasant experience, let me tell ya. It started a few days ago, just thought it was somethin' I ate, but it ain't stoppin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. I understand. Bleeding from the stomach is certainly concerning, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. “A few days ago” – can you tell me a little more about when it specifically started?
PATIENT: Specifically? Jeez, you want specifics. Alright, alright. Let me think… it was… Tuesday, yeah, Tuesday morning. Woke up, felt a bit off, then… well, then I saw it. Bright red, you know? Not just a little bit, either. Enough to worry a fella. I thought maybe I'd just… irritated somethin'. But it’s been gettin' worse each day. I just figured I'd wait it out, see if it settled, but… it hasn’t. It's a bit much to ignore now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday morning. And it's been progressively worsening since then. Bright red blood, you said. Is it consistently bright red, or have you noticed any changes in color – perhaps darker, like coffee grounds, or more of a maroon color?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't a doctor, alright? I just know what I see. It's been mostly red, yeah. Pretty bright, like… well, like blood. I did notice somethin' different this mornin', though. It was a bit… darker, I guess. Not coffee grounds, exactly, but kinda… chunky, you know? And… brownish. I thought maybe it was somethin' I ate last night, but then I remembered I didn’t eat nothin’ last night. Too much on my mind. So, yeah, darker this mornin'. That's about it. I don't know what all that means, that's why I'm here. Honestly, this whole thing is just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It is unpleasant, and you're doing the right thing by coming in. The change in color to darker, chunky material is important information. It suggests the bleeding may be from higher up in the digestive tract. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… I’ve been feelin’ tired, really tired. More tired than usual, and I’m always tired. But this is… different. Like, drained. I haven't had much of an appetite, not that I usually do, but even less now. And... kinda lightheaded, you know? Especially when I stand up too fast. Makes me a bit shaky. Oh, and my stomach's been… rumblin' a lot. Not painful, just… noisy. Is that important? I don't know. Everything feels off, to be honest. It's just a mess, a whole mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, loss of appetite, lightheadedness, and stomach rumbling. The lightheadedness is particularly concerning, as it can indicate you're losing blood volume. Now, have you noticed any pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. It’s not like a sharp pain, or anything. It's more… discomfort, I guess. Like a dull ache, kinda low down. Comes and goes, mostly after… well, after I use the bathroom, if you know what I mean. It’s not somethin’ I’d go to the hospital for, not on its own. Just… annoying, that’s all. It's barely noticeable most of the time. I just figured it was… somethin’ I ate, or somethin’. You know, old age creepin’ in. But this bleedin'… that’s what’s got me worried. That and feelin' like I’m gonna faint any minute now.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache that comes and goes after bowel movements. And the fatigue and lightheadedness are definitely concerning. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as ulcers, gastritis, or any other stomach problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me think. Doc always said I had a sensitive stomach, somethin' about too much acid. But nothin' major, nothin' they ever gave me a name for. I had my gallbladder out maybe fifteen years ago, somethin’ like that. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she used to take me to the doc a lot for checkups, but I never paid much attention to what he said. She handled all that. She passed a few years back, so… I don't really have much of a medical history to speak of. Honestly, I mostly just stayed away from doctors unless absolutely necessary. Still do, to be honest. It's never been a good experience.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult. And it's common to avoid doctors if past experiences haven’t been positive. Do you take any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Nothin’ at all. Never been much of a pill-popper. I tried somethin’ for my stomach once, years ago, but it didn’t do nothin’ and just gave me heartburn, so I stopped takin’ it. I mostly just drink water, try to eat somethin' now and then. No supplements, no nothin’. I prefer to just… deal with it, you know? What good are pills gonna do anyway? Just mask the problem. That's what I always figured. She used to try and get me to take vitamins, but I never bothered. So, no. Nothin'. Plain as day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – foods, environmental factors, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had any allergies, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My wife used to tease me 'bout it, said I had a cast iron stomach. She was wrong, I guess. It ain't cast iron if it's bleedin', is it? But no, nothin'. Never had a reaction to anythin’ in my life. Dust, pollen, food… nothin’. Never had to carry an EpiPen or nothin’ like that. So, no. None at all. Simple as that. I'm a pretty simple fella, really. No fancy allergies, no fancy medications. Just me and my… bleedin’ stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of stomach cancer, ulcers, or bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My family… we weren’t big on talkin' about medical stuff, if you know what I mean. It was mostly just… keep it to yourself, don’t complain. My father… he had some stomach trouble, I think. But he never went to the doctor, never talked about it. Just… rubbed his belly and said it was somethin' he ate. My mother… she passed when I was young, so I don't really remember much about her medical history. And I don't really have any siblings, so… I don't know. I honestly don't have much information to give you on that front. It’s all kinda… hazy, if you know what I mean. We weren't a talkative bunch. So, no. Not that I’m aware of. It’s a bit of a blank, to be honest. A complete blank.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of a blank regarding family history. That’s alright, we can still proceed. Now, I'm going to need to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… jeez. Alright. Look, I used to smoke, years ago. Back when I was younger, a pack a day, maybe. But I quit about twenty years ago, when my wife got sick. Didn’t seem right, smokin’ while she was… sufferin’. So, no. Not anymore. Alcohol… I drink a little, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on a Saturday night. Nothin’ heavy. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never touched the stuff in my life. Always thought it was a waste of time and money. I’m a pretty straightforward fella, if you know what I mean. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book. So, no. Not much of a lifestyle to speak of, really. Just me, my book, and… well, now my bleedin’ stomach. It's a simple life, but it's always been good enough for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker, occasional alcohol use, no recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Gentz. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Look, I don't particularly like doctors touchin' me, if you know what I mean. But… if you think it’s necessary, I guess so. I just… I'm not fond of it. I'm a private fella. But alright. Do what you gotta do, I suppose. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And tell me what you're doin' beforehand, so I don't get surprised. I don’t handle surprises very well, especially when it involves bein’ poked and prodded. Just… be quick about it, if you could. I'm not tryin’ to be difficult, but I'm just sayin'. I don’t enjoy this, not one bit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I completely understand your hesitation, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I’ll explain each step before I do it. We’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I'll also need to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Okay, I’m gently pressing on your abdomen now. Do you feel any pain or tenderness in any particular area?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You're bein' gentle enough, I guess. It's just… uncomfortable, you know? Pressin’ on the stomach… it doesn't feel right. Now… tenderness? Hmm. Not really sharp pain, but… there’s a bit of discomfort right… here. Just a dull ache, kinda like I been tellin’ you. It’s not terrible, but it's definitely noticeable when you press on it. And… there’s a bit of… tightness, I guess you could call it. Not like a muscle cramp, just… firm. Is that what you’re lookin' for? It’s all kinda vague, to be honest. I ain't a doctor, I just know what feels off. But yeah, that area right there. It’s not pleasant, I can tell you that much. Don't press too hard, alright? It's already makin’ me feel queasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know, Mr. Gentz. That’s helpful. Tenderness in the upper left quadrant is significant. I also note some mild guarding - that's when your muscles instinctively tighten up to protect the area. The rest of your abdomen feels relatively soft, but there's some overall mild discomfort. I'm not feeling any masses or significant distension. Your vital signs are blood pressure 130/80, pulse 88, and temperature 98.6. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's concerning. The bleeding, combined with the tenderness in your upper left quadrant and mild guarding, suggests we need to investigate further. I'm worried about a potential ulcer or gastritis, but we need to rule out other causes as well. I'm going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a stool test to check for blood. I also think we need to schedule an endoscopy, which is a procedure where we use a small camera to look inside your stomach and duodenum. It's the best way to determine the cause of the bleeding and get a biopsy if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Look, I already don't like bein' poked and prodded, and now you wanna put a camera down my throat? That sounds… awful. Absolutely awful. Is there any other way? I'm not fond of invasive procedures, not one bit. I'd rather just… take some pills or somethin'. Honestly, this is startin' to sound like a nightmare. Pills I can handle, maybe. But a camera down my throat? That’s… too much. Can't we just try somethin’ else first? I don't like this, not one bit. I'm a simple fella, and I prefer simple solutions. A camera down my throat is not a simple solution. It sounds painful and… humiliating, frankly. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz. An endoscopy is not the most pleasant procedure, and it's perfectly reasonable to be anxious about it. Unfortunately, an endoscopy is the most accurate way to determine the cause of your bleeding and rule out more serious conditions, like cancer. While pills can help manage symptoms like heartburn, they won't tell us why you're bleeding. Before we jump to an endoscopy, we can start with the blood tests and stool tests to get a better picture of your overall condition and see if we can identify any clues. However, if those tests don't give us a definitive answer, an endoscopy will be necessary to rule out anything serious. We can also discuss options for sedation during the endoscopy to make you more comfortable. You won't be awake during the procedure, and you won't remember it. Would you be open to starting with the blood tests and stool tests, and then we can re-evaluate the need for an endoscopy based on the results?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood tests and stool tests… I can handle that. It's not ideal, but it's better than a camera down my throat right now. As long as you promise me we'll re-evaluate afterward. I'm not keen on any unnecessary procedures, and I don't want you pushin' me into somethin' I'm not comfortable with. And… make sure the lab knows I don't like needles. I faint easily, you know? I’m a bit of a delicate flower, when it comes to that sort of thing. Alright. Blood tests and stool tests it is. Just… try to be quick, alright? And make sure they’re gentle. I’m already feelin’ queasy just thinkin’ about it. And please, no surprises. I don’t handle surprises very well.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I will make sure the lab technician is aware of your anxiety and needle aversion. They are very experienced and will do their best to make you comfortable. We’ll take things slow and steady. I’ll also be right there with you. I'll write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool occult blood test. The lab is just down the hall. Once you've had the tests done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces stomach acid – to help with your symptoms. It may help to stop the bleeding, but it won't address the underlying cause. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A proton pump inhibitor… sounds complicated. What are the side effects? I don't want somethin' that’s gonna make me feel even worse. I'm already feelin' queasy and tired, I don't need any extra problems. And… will it interact with anythin' I might eat? I mostly just eat soup and toast, but still. Just… tell me what I'm gettin' myself into before I take anythin'. I'm not keen on bein’ a guinea pig, if you know what I mean. I prefer simple solutions, and I don’t want any surprises. And… how long will it take before I start feelin' better? I'm not gettin' any younger, and I'd like to feel somethin' positive soon. This whole thing is just… a mess.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Gentz. It’s important to understand what you're taking and potential side effects. The medication I’m prescribing is called omeprazole. It's a commonly used proton pump inhibitor – PPI – and it works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. Common side effects are generally mild and can include nausea, diarrhea, headache, and abdominal pain. These usually subside within a few days. More serious side effects are rare, but can include vitamin B12 deficiency and increased risk of certain infections with long-term use. We will monitor you for those. Regarding interactions, omeprazole can interact with certain medications, but it doesn’t typically interact with soup or toast. It’s important to tell me about all medications you take, even over-the-counter ones. It typically takes a few days to a week to see noticeable improvement in your symptoms. However, it’s important to continue taking the medication as prescribed, even if you start feeling better, to allow your stomach to heal. Do you have any other concerns or questions about the omeprazole?
PATIENT: Vitamin B12 deficiency? Now you're startin' to scare me. I don't want any deficiencies, I just want to feel better. And infections? Seriously? This is soundin' worse and worse by the minute. Maybe I should just stick to the soup and toast and hope for the best. And I told you, I don’t take any medications. Just… soup and toast. But alright. Fine. I’ll try the omeprazole. But if I start feelin’ any worse, I’m stoppin’ it immediately. And I'm holdin' you responsible. So… just tell me when I can schedule the follow-up appointment. And… make it soon. I don’t want to be waitin’ around for weeks, feelin’ sick and worried. This whole thing is just… a nightmare, I tell ya. A complete nightmare. Just… make it soon. And no surprises, alright? No surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for causing you any additional worry. The risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and infection is rare with short-term use of omeprazole. We will monitor you closely for any signs of these issues. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today. That will give us time to assess how you're responding to the medication and discuss the results of your blood tests. I have you scheduled for a follow-up appointment next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. And rest assured, I will do everything I can to ensure you receive the best possible care. I will also be happy to answer any questions you may have between now and your appointment. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that's it. Just… try not to give me any more bad news, alright? And… no surprises. Thank you. I guess. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gentz. I hope you feel better soon. And I promise to keep you informed every step of the way, with no surprises. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
