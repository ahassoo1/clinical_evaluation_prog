DOCTOR: Hi Amy, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's good you're getting it checked. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's…hard to describe exactly. It’s not painful, thankfully. It feels…firm, and it seems to be getting a bit bigger, slowly. I first noticed it maybe a month or two ago, just when I was getting ready for bed one night. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright, so firm, not painful, and you've noticed it gradually increasing in size over a month or two. And you found it while getting ready for bed… was that through feeling it, or just visually noticing something different?
PATIENT: Through feeling it, yes. I was just…rubbing lotion on my stomach, you know, part of my routine, and that’s when I felt it. It wasn't immediately obvious, just a little bump. I thought maybe I was just feeling my muscles, but it didn’t feel quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is it located?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s… kind of in the middle, a little to the left of my belly button, I think? It's not super high up, more towards my… lower stomach area. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but that’s the general area. Would it help if I… pointed?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Here. Right about here. Does that make sense? It's not huge, but it's definitely noticeable now. I’m a choreographer, so I’m quite aware of my body, you know? And this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Thanks for pointing that out. And you mentioned being a choreographer, so you’re very body-aware—that’s good. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s so strange about it. No pain, no fever, no changes in my…bathroom habits, nothing like that. Just the lump. I haven’t felt any weaker or more tired than usual, either. It’s just…there. Which is why I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, no associated symptoms. That’s good to know. Let’s get some more background information. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I don’t take anything regularly, either – just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for a headache, but nothing else. I haven’t had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no regular medications, no significant past medical or surgical history. That's helpful. Now, are there any major medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a bit of a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, and my father had diabetes, but that was later in life. My grandparents… I don’t really know much about their medical history, unfortunately. We weren’t very close, and my parents have both passed away now. There wasn’t much discussion of family health issues, if that makes sense. It's not something we really talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your father, and limited information about the rest of the family history. We'll proceed with that in mind. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I'm a choreographer, so I’m very active. I’m on my feet most of the day, rehearsing with dancers, teaching classes… It’s physically demanding work. I eat a fairly healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. I try to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I’d say overall, I live a pretty healthy lifestyle. I also try to get at least seven or eight hours of sleep each night, although with rehearsals, that doesn’t always happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, very active lifestyle, healthy diet, no smoking, moderate alcohol use. That’s all good information. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. It is firm, as you said, and approximately… 2 centimeters in diameter. It doesn't feel deeply embedded, and there’s no pain on palpation, which is good. It's slightly mobile, which is also a positive sign. I don't feel any other masses or abnormalities. Bowel sounds are normal. Okay. I'm going to check your vital signs now. Blood pressure, pulse… everything looks normal. Now, to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. I also think an abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to get a clearer image of the mass. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very sensible, Doctor. A blood test and an ultrasound…absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever's necessary to find out what this is. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. When can I expect the results? And where would I go for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll send the lab orders to the front desk, and they'll get you set up. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. As for the ultrasound, I can give you a referral to the imaging center across town. They usually have appointments available within a few days. I’ll write that referral now. Here’s the referral. Call them, and they'll schedule an appointment. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours, and the ultrasound results may take a little longer, depending on their schedule. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any pain, fever, nausea, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. That’s very reassuring. I appreciate your patience and your explanations. I’ll schedule the ultrasound right away, and I’ll let your nurse know if anything changes. Thank you again for your time. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
