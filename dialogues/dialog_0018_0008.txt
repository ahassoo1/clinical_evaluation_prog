DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. Yes. It’s my ear, you see. Feels… blocked. Full, like. Not painful, exactly, just… there. It’s been going on a bit now. I… honestly, I can't recall exactly when it started. A while, though. Definitely a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. So, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing a feeling of fullness or blockage in your ear for some time now. You mentioned not being certain of when it started, but can you perhaps give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Before the… the summer, I think. Yes. Before the really hot weather. Maybe… a month or so before? It's difficult. Things… blur, you know? I do a lot of driving for work, inspecting farms… Perhaps that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It can be difficult to pinpoint exact dates. So, we're looking at roughly a month or so before the hot weather started—perhaps around the end of June, early July?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… about right. End of June, maybe. Yes. Look, I just want to get it sorted, if you know what I mean. It's a bit distracting when I'm trying to concentrate. The farms… they need a good eye, you see. And this… buzzing… fullness… makes it harder. It's not a bad pain, just… annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's certainly frustrating when something like this interferes with your work and concentration. You mentioned a buzzing sensation along with the fullness—is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go, yes. Mostly when I’m… well, driving, I think. Or if it’s very quiet. It’s not… loud, but noticeable. Like a… a very faint electrical hum. Not a sharp pain, I keep saying that, don’t I? Just… present. It's hard to describe. Look, I’m not very good at explaining these things, Doctor. I just know it’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's very helpful to know it comes and goes and is more noticeable in quiet environments or during driving. Now, to get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Oh dear. That’s… a difficult one. When I was a boy, maybe? I had a lot of colds. I think I remember… something. But it was a long time ago. I honestly couldn't say for sure. My wife… she handled all those things. She remembered everything. I… well, I don’t. And it's been a few years since… since she passed. Sorry. I'm rambling. No, I don't think so. But don't rely on that.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's perfectly understandable to have difficulty recalling details from the past, especially after a loss. It’s alright if you're not certain. We can proceed without a definitive answer on that. Have you experienced any hearing loss in either ear, or any ringing in your ears besides this buzzing sensation?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… no, not that I’ve noticed. People still yell at me when I reverse the truck, so… That's probably not a scientific answer, though, is it? And the ringing… just the buzzing, really. Not a constant ring. It's… subtle. I think if it was a proper ring, I’d have mentioned it. No, just the buzzing, when it’s quiet. And during driving. Is that helpful? I’m getting a bit flustered now, sorry.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. And your observations are very valuable. It's good to know it's not a constant ringing, and that the buzzing is linked to quiet environments and driving. Now, let's briefly talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something a few years back. I think. I take a pill for it, yes. A small orange one. Once a day. And… no diabetes, I don’t think. And my heart… I’ve never had any problems with my heart. Just… gets a bit fast when I'm chasing after paperwork. Nothing serious. I have private insurance, you see. They keep an eye on things. It’s the blood pressure, yes. That’s the only thing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's good to know you're managing your blood pressure with medication. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the orange pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Just the orange pill. Sometimes a painkiller for my back, if I've been lifting something heavy at the farms. But that’s… occasional. Very occasional. No, just the orange pill, taken every day. That’s it. I’m quite simple, really. Don’t need much looking after.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's helpful to have a clear picture of your medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Pollen… I sneeze a bit in the spring, but everyone does, don’t they? No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No, none at all. Just the spring sneezes, that's all. Is that alright? Do you need to know more? I’m starting to feel a bit dizzy now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's good to know you don't have any known allergies. And don't worry about feeling a bit dizzy; we can proceed at your pace. Now, I would like to perform a quick examination of your ears, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve looking inside your ears with an instrument called an otoscope. It doesn't hurt, but it might feel a little cool. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An examination… Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I… I don’t like things going in my ears. But if it will help… yes. Quickly, if possible? I have… farms to inspect, you see. And paperwork. A lot of paperwork. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. Alright, let’s take a look. I see a bit of wax buildup in both ear canals. The eardrums themselves appear intact, but slightly dull. This could be contributing to the feeling of fullness and the buzzing sensation. There's no sign of any infection or fluid behind the eardrums. Is there any pain when I gently wiggle your outer ear like this?
PATIENT: Wiggle… No, no pain. Just… a strange sensation. Like… pressure, maybe? Not a bad pressure, just… noticeable. Yes, noticeable. It's like when you fly on an airplane, you know? That feeling in your ears. Like that. But… less intense. It's hard to explain. And it's only when you wiggle it, yes? Not usually. It's just… when you touch it. Is that helpful? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded now. Perhaps I should sit down.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. That is helpful. The sensation you're describing when I wiggle your ear suggests there might be some slight inflammation or irritation. The fact that it's not constant but only occurs with manipulation is reassuring. We can proceed at your pace. Based on my examination, it seems likely that the fullness and buzzing in your ear are caused by a combination of wax buildup and some mild inflammation. We can try to remove the wax buildup first, which may resolve your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with me attempting to remove the wax using a gentle irrigation technique?
PATIENT: Irrigation… Water in my ear? Oh dear. I don’t like the sound of that. Will it be… cold? And will it make me dizzy? I… I’ve never had anything done to my ears before. My wife always took care of these things. I just want to be able to hear properly again, you see. And… and not feel this fullness. But water in my ear… I’m not sure. Is there another way? Perhaps something… less wet? I’m a bit nervous now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's perfectly reasonable to be nervous about having water in your ear. We can discuss alternatives. There is a wax softening solution we can use for a few days beforehand to help loosen the wax. Then, if the wax doesn't come out on its own, we can use gentle irrigation. Another option is to refer you to an audiologist, who specializes in ear care and has more advanced tools for wax removal. They can use a small suction device instead of water, if you prefer. Would you be more comfortable with trying the wax softening solution first, or would you prefer a referral to an audiologist?
PATIENT: Hmm… the softening solution… That sounds… less frightening than water. Yes, I think I’d prefer that. Something to put in my ear, rather than something going in. A few days… yes. That sounds manageable. And if it doesn’t work, then maybe… the audiologist? Yes. That sounds like a plan. A plan sounds good. Just… tell me exactly what I need to do, and how long I need to use it for. I don’t want to get it wrong. And… is there anything I should avoid doing while I’m using it? I have farms to inspect, you see. And paperwork. A lot of paperwork.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good plan, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. We'll start with the wax softening solution. I’m going to prescribe you a solution called Ceruminol. You’ll need to instill two to three drops into the affected ear twice a day for five to seven days. Lie on your side with the affected ear facing upwards for about five to ten minutes after instilling the drops to allow the solution to soak in. While using the drops, it's best to avoid getting water in your ear. You can continue with your normal activities, including your farm inspections and paperwork, but try to avoid swimming or showering with your ears submerged. After five to seven days, if you still experience fullness or buzzing, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we can discuss a referral to an audiologist. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: Ceruminol… twice a day… five to seven days… And avoid getting water in my ear. Yes, I think I understand. But… what if the water gets in accidentally? When it rains, you see, on the farms… It’s inevitable sometimes. And… what if it stings? Will it be painful? I… I’m a bit anxious about this, if I’m honest. I just want to be able to hear properly again, you see. And… and get back to my paperwork. A lot of paperwork.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. You’re right to ask those questions. If water accidentally gets in while it’s raining on the farms, don’t worry too much. It’s unlikely to cause any serious harm. It might cause a temporary sensation of fullness or slight discomfort, but it should subside on its own. If it does cause significant discomfort or you notice any pain, please call the office immediately. The Ceruminol solution itself shouldn’t sting, but it might feel a little cool or slightly strange when you first instill it. It’s a very mild solution. We'll start with this and see how you respond. Remember, if you have any concerns or notice any changes, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Do you have any other questions for me today?
