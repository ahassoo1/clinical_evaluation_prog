DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s about the surgery, I guess. The weight loss surgery. I’m here for… the check-up before that, right? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. My wife mostly handled setting everything up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. These things can be overwhelming. It’s good your wife is helping you with it. So, you’re here for your pre-operative evaluation for bariatric surgery. Excellent. Let me just take a look at the information we have so far… Okay, I see the initial consultation notes here. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about why you decided to pursue weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s… a lot. Honestly, it’s been building for a long time. I just… get tired easily, you know? Everything is harder. Walking, playing with my kids… even just getting up the stairs. And my wife… she worries. She’s right to, I guess. I want to be able to do things again, be healthier. And… I want to be around for a long time for them. It’s hard to explain. I just feel… stuck. Does that make sense? I don’t really remember talking about all this before.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like this is something you've been thinking about for a while, and it’s wonderful that you’re taking steps to improve your health for yourself and your family. It’s very common to feel that way. Now, let's talk a bit more specifically about your health. Have you been experiencing any particular symptoms lately – anything new or worsening that might be related to your weight or overall health?
PATIENT: Hmm… new symptoms… let me think. I get… winded pretty easily, like I said. And my knees… they ache a lot, especially at night. I’ve been trying to ignore it, thinking it’s just age, but… it’s getting worse. I also get… heartburn sometimes? Not every day, but it’s been happening more often. I’ve been taking some over-the-counter stuff for it, but it doesn't always help. Oh, and I sweat a lot, even when I’m not doing anything. Is that… normal? I don't know. My memory isn't great, so I forget if this is new or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, windedness, knee pain, heartburn, and increased sweating. Thank you for sharing that. It's good you're telling me everything, even if you're unsure if it's new. We can sort it out. The knee pain and windedness are certainly common with increased weight. Increased sweating can sometimes be related to underlying medical conditions, so it's good you mentioned it. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think my wife said something about that at the doctor's last year? But I don’t remember taking any pills for it. And… maybe cholesterol? I get blood work done sometimes, but I never really pay attention to the results. My wife handles all that. I honestly don’t know if I have any other conditions. I've never been seriously sick, if that makes sense. Just… tired a lot. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had some indications of high blood pressure and potentially high cholesterol, but haven't been formally diagnosed or treated, if I understand correctly. And being tired a lot isn’t necessarily a condition in itself, but it’s a symptom we need to investigate. Okay, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. That needed a cast, but it was a long time ago. And… I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think. Other than that… no, nothing major. No hospital stays that I remember. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I mostly just go to the doctor for check-ups, but I usually fall asleep during them. My wife gets mad at me for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, tonsillectomy. That's helpful to know. It sounds like a relatively uncomplicated medical history so far. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Heart disease… yeah, my dad had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was in his sixties, I think. And my mom… she had diabetes, I’m pretty sure. And… my uncle on my mother’s side had cancer, but I don’t remember what kind. Everyone on both sides seems to have something, honestly. It’s… a bit scary, thinking about it. My wife always tells me to be careful, to get check-ups. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Thank you for sharing that. It's understandable that it feels overwhelming. Knowing this information is important, and it's good you're aware of it. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I… used to drink sometimes, maybe a beer or two with dinner, but I stopped a few years ago. My wife didn’t like it, and… I didn't really miss it. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I’ve never been into any of that. I mostly just drink water, honestly. It’s boring, I know, but it's what I do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Kochubey. There’s nothing wrong with a healthy lifestyle. And no history of smoking or drug use is excellent. One last thing about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take something for heartburn sometimes, like I said, but it’s just over-the-counter stuff. Tums, or something like that. And… I think my wife gave me some vitamins a while back, but I don’t remember what they were for. I honestly don't take a lot of pills. My wife keeps track of all that too. I just… forget. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad that you forget, Mr. Kochubey. It just means we need to be thorough and make sure we have all the information. So, just occasional over-the-counter heartburn medication and some vitamins you’re not sure about. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. Just… try not to scare me, okay? I don't do well with doctors. My wife will be mad if I faint.
DOCTOR: I'll do my best to keep things calm and comfortable, Mr. Kochubey. I promise. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll get started. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, but there’s some slight diminished breath sounds at the bases, could be from some mild excess weight. Now, let’s check your blood pressure… Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen… Abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. Slightly obese, as expected. No significant findings there. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, other than the elevated blood pressure and some diminished breath sounds, likely related to your weight. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You checked everything, right? Is everything… okay? Can the surgery actually help me? My wife says it will, but… I'm still scared. I don’t want to get sicker. I just want to feel normal again. I guess… what are the risks? I don't remember the doctor explaining everything very well. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Mr. Kochubey. It's a big decision, and you're right to ask questions. And yes, you're right to want to feel normal again. That's the goal. Let’s talk about that. The surgery can be very helpful for many people with significant obesity, improving your overall health, reducing your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions. But it’s not without risks. Some of the risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, and leaks from the surgical connections. There's also a risk of nutritional deficiencies after the surgery, which is why it’s crucial to follow a strict diet and take the prescribed vitamins. There's a small risk of more serious complications, but our surgical team is highly experienced in minimizing those risks. The key is to be realistic about the surgery and to commit to the lifestyle changes that are necessary for success. It’s not a quick fix, but it can be a life-changing procedure for the right candidate. Before we proceed, I would like to order some blood work to get a better baseline of your health, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid profile, and vitamin levels. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart health. And, given your family history, I would like to schedule you for a consultation with a cardiologist. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot to take in. Blood work, a heart doctor… It sounds scary. But… I guess it’s better to know everything, right? If it helps make sure I’m okay. Yeah, okay. Blood work, and the heart doctor. Whatever you think is best. Can my wife come to the appointment with the heart doctor? I get nervous when I’m alone. And… can you explain everything again to her too? She’s the one who knows all the details, anyway.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. That’s perfectly reasonable. Having your wife with you for the cardiology appointment and having me explain everything to both of you is a great idea. It’s important that you both feel comfortable and informed. I’ll make a note to ensure the cardiologist knows you're being evaluated for bariatric surgery and that your wife will be attending. We'll also send a copy of your blood work results to the cardiologist as soon as they're available. For now, let’s focus on getting those blood tests done. I’ll have the receptionist give you a lab order before you leave. The sooner we have those results, the sooner we can move forward. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, Mr. Kochubey?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. I’m… still scared, but I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well. And… thank you for letting my wife come to the appointments. That means a lot. I guess I’ll go get the blood work done. I just… hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. And it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. The receptionist will be happy to help you schedule the blood work. Just let them know you’re here for pre-operative evaluation for bariatric surgery. Take care, Mr. Kochubey. I look forward to seeing you both soon.
