DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Annesley. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get this life insurance thing done. You know, the exam. Trying to get it over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. A life insurance physical. We can definitely get that taken care of efficiently. Just a standard exam, blood pressure, heart rate, a little listen to the lungs, check your reflexes… standard stuff. Before we jump in, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I’m alright, I guess. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I have Medicare, so I see a doctor when I need to, you know? Nothing major lately. I was married for a long time, but we got divorced a few years back. That was… stressful. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That gives me a little bit of a picture, thank you. Stress definitely impacts health, so that's good information to have. When you say you get tired sometimes, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s just… throughout the day, mostly. Not like, can’t-get-out-of-bed tired, just… worn out. Especially in the afternoons. I work at a hotel, managing things, so I'm on my feet a lot and dealing with people all day. It can be draining. And it’s hot, you know? Been really hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue worse in the afternoons, especially with the demands of your job. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe a little bit of shortness of breath sometimes when I’m walking up the stairs, but I’m a little… well, I carry a bit of extra weight, so I figured that was just from that. Nothing I haven't lived with for a while, you know? Is that something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing it up. Any new symptom is worth checking, even if it seems small. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better picture. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your general health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Just… let’s get it done, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. We’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit back and relax. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me when I tell you. Deep breath in… and out… again… and again. Sounds clear, but I am noting some slight diminished breath sounds at the bases. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 82 and regular. Now, let's just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Open wide and say "ah…"
PATIENT: Okay, "ah…" This is… a little uncomfortable. I don't go to the doctor much, remember? Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Everything looks alright visually, no signs of infection in your throat or ears. A few slightly enlarged lymph nodes, but nothing dramatically concerning at this point. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. Look, are we almost done? I'm starting to get a little anxious being poked and prodded like this. I just need a form signed, right? That’s all the insurance company cares about.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Putney, and we are getting close. Just a few more quick questions. Have you been taking any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. I drink a lot of water, that’s it. Look, I just want to know if I can go now. Are you going to need blood work or anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're eager to get this finished, and we'll be as efficient as possible. Just to be thorough, and to get a clearer picture of your health, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It’s just standard procedure for a life insurance physical, and will help us ensure everything is in good working order. It involves a simple blood draw and we can get it done here at the clinic today. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Blood work, okay. But can we please hurry? I got things I need to do. I'm already late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. We will get the blood work done as quickly as possible. The phlebotomist is ready and waiting. Then, once we have those results, we can finalize the form for your life insurance company. While we're waiting for the blood work, I want to discuss the slightly diminished breath sounds I heard, and the fatigue you've been experiencing. I want to rule out anything serious, and we can discuss some lifestyle changes that might help.
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I'm a little overweight. It's probably just that. And I work a stressful job. Can't we just skip the lecture and get the blood drawn? I'm not feeling very well right now, and this is making things worse. I just need the form, okay? I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Putney. You're right, let's get the blood work done first. It's just a precaution. Please take this to the lab just down the hall. Once they're done, the results will be sent to me. I will review them as soon as they arrive and complete the form for your life insurance company. In the meantime, if you start feeling worse, please let the nurses know immediately. .
