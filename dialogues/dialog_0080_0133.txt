DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, it's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need some forms signed, really. Just a notary thing, I think. Some health papers… I don’t really understand all of it, to be honest. I just need them verified so I can… well, so I can get on with things. Is that something you can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Notary services aren't typically within a family doctor's scope, unfortunately. I can review the health papers with you, explain what they are, and answer any questions you have about the medical content. That way, you'll know exactly what you're signing. But I can't officially notarize them. Before we get to the papers, though, just so I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about why these health papers need to be verified?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, that’s… not ideal. I was hoping it would be simple. Alright, reviewing them sounds good, I suppose. Better than nothing. Let me see… It’s for a program, a little bit of assistance. They need proof of… well, they need to know I am a doctor, and that I'm… healthy enough to work, I guess. Something about being able to practice. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly. And I don’t have insurance right now, so it’s extra tricky. It’s for a small grant to help cover some costs.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A verification of good health for a grant program. We can definitely work with that. And no insurance isn't a problem, we'll figure it out. Let me pull up your chart here... Melvenia Tippens, born…?
PATIENT: October 14th, 1948. Though goodness knows what they have on file. It's been a while since I've had to fill out all these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a few notes here from some visits a few years back… height 189 centimeters, weight 110 pounds… And it looks like there's a mention of some routine check-ups. To get a better understanding of your current health status for this grant, let's just go through a quick review of things. Starting with, are you experiencing any specific health problems right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that height is right, I'm a tall woman. And yes, well, my knees bother me sometimes. Old age, I suppose. And I get a little tired quicker than I used to. Nothing major, really. Just… slowing down, you know? No aches or pains that keep me from working, thankfully. I still see patients. It just takes a bit longer to get around.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees bothering you and some increased fatigue. That’s helpful to know. And it's good to hear you're still practicing! Could you tell me a little more about the knee pain?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not constant. It mostly happens when I've been on my feet all day, or if I try to go up and down stairs too quickly. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. And it gets better if I sit and rest it. I usually just ignore it, to be honest. I’ve never really bothered a doctor about it. Old women get achy knees, it’s just what happens.
DOCTOR: I understand, but it’s still good to document it. It's important to have a complete picture, even for something you consider normal. And the fatigue—has that been a recent change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It’s been over the last… oh, maybe a year or so. I just chalked it up to getting older, honestly. I used to be able to work all day and still have energy for… well, for things. Now I need a little nap in the afternoon sometimes. It doesn’t interfere with my work, but it’s noticeable. It’s just… life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of fatigue over the past year. And it hasn’t significantly impacted your ability to work. Now, just to cover all the bases, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but that’s been happening for years. My memory isn’t perfect, but who’s does it at my age? Nothing sudden or alarming, no. I eat pretty well, I think. And I sleep okay, when I'm not napping! I’m pretty healthy for an old woman, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, the notes here mention some routine checkups a few years back. Do you recall any significant medical conditions or surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I remember that. And I broke my arm once, when I was a teenager. Nothing major, really. No serious illnesses or surgeries. I've been very lucky, health-wise. I did have a bad flu a couple of years ago, but that's about it. It knocked me down for a week. Is that the kind of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a broken arm in adolescence, and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. When it gets high. But it's not regular. I don’t take anything else. Just that, when I need it. Here, I think this is it. But I haven't taken it in months. Honestly, I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I haven't had any problems with allergies in my life. I'm pretty simple that way, too. No special needs, no fancy requirements. Just an old woman who needs some papers signed. Are we getting closer to that now?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and only occasional blood pressure medication. Before we look at the papers, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It'll only take a few minutes. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. But please be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding, if you don’t mind my saying so. But if it’s necessary for the papers… then alright. Just… take it easy, please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be very gentle. We'll just take things slowly. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given the context. Finally, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is always the worst part. Ooh, that's a little uncomfortable. There we go. See? Not too bad, but they do ache. A little swollen, maybe. I haven’t really looked at them closely in a while. Old age, you know? Everything starts to creak and groan. Am I failing the test?
DOCTOR: Alright. There's mild tenderness to palpation over both medial joint lines. Minimal swelling noted. Range of motion is slightly limited, but within normal limits. No instability noted. Mild tenderness to palpation bilaterally at the medial joint lines, minimal swelling. Slightly limited range of motion, no instability. You’re not failing any tests! Everything looks normal for your age. There's a little bit of arthritis, which is common, but nothing concerning. Now, let’s take a look at those papers you brought in. Do you have them with you?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Here they are. A bit of a mess, I’m afraid. I haven’t really had a chance to look at them properly. It’s all very confusing, all the legal words and tiny print. I’m just hoping you can make sense of it all. Is it something you can actually do? I really need to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see... these are forms requesting verification of your medical status for a small business grant. Looks like they need confirmation that you are a licensed physician in good standing and that you are physically capable of performing your duties. This section requires a statement about your current health status. I can certainly fill this out, confirming that you are generally healthy and able to practice medicine. And this section... it's a waiver of liability. Do you have any specific concerns about any of these forms?
PATIENT: Oh, a waiver of liability… That sounds ominous. I don’t really understand what it means. What am I waiving liability for? Am I signing away my rights to sue someone if something goes wrong? I don’t want to get into trouble. Is this something I have to sign? Can we just skip that part? I just want to get the grant, I don't want to get into legal complications.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious about this. This waiver is a standard clause for grant recipients, protecting the granting organization from liability in case you experience any health issues related to your work. It doesn’t necessarily prevent you from seeking medical care, but it does release them from responsibility for any complications that may arise. It's a bit of a legal gray area, and truthfully, it's not ideal. However, it’s very common for these types of grants. It’s unlikely you'll need to utilize this waiver, but it is something to be aware of. If you’d prefer, we can draft a statement clarifying that you’re signing this waiver under duress, as a condition of receiving the grant. It won’t necessarily invalidate the waiver, but it will document your concerns. Or, we can skip it altogether and you can contact the granting organization to see if it’s a mandatory requirement. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is more complicated than I thought. Drafting a statement… that sounds like the safest option, I suppose. I don’t want to get into trouble with the law. And I really need this grant. What exactly should I write? I’m not very good at legal language. Can you give me a hand? I just want to make sure I’m covered, you know? Perhaps you could write something, and I can sign it? I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This statement says: “I, Melvenia Tippens, am signing this waiver of liability under duress, as a condition of receiving a small business grant from [Granting Organization Name]. I understand the terms of the waiver, but I am signing it with reservations.” If you’re comfortable with that, you can sign it here. The rest of the forms are pretty straightforward. I can initial and sign them, confirming your medical status and ability to practice. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. That makes me feel a little better. There. Alright, let’s get it over with. Just do what you need to do. I trust you. The sooner this is finished, the better. I have patients waiting, you know. I just want to be done with all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright, all finished. Here you are. I’ve also made a copy for your records. I hope this helps you get the grant you need. And please, don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment if you have any health concerns in the future. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few other patients waiting. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate your patience. I should probably get going. My patients are waiting, as you said. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and have a good day.
