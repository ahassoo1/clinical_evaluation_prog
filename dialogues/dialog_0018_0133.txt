DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I just need some forms signed, really. It's for… verification, I guess. Health forms. A lot of paperwork these days, you know? I’m hoping you can just look them over and say everything’s alright. I’d like to get this done quickly, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. I understand. We certainly do have a lot of paperwork these days. Please, have a seat. While I am happy to review forms, as your physician, I do want to ensure I have a complete understanding of your current health status to properly complete them. It's important for me to ask a few questions, even if you feel they are unnecessary, to ensure the accuracy of the verification. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose that makes sense. I just… I don’t have a lot of time today, Doctor. But yes, you can ask. Just… try to be brief, please? It's mostly just routine stuff, I imagine. I've been generally healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. I will do my best to be as efficient as possible. To start, could you please confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: It’s… November 12th, 1948. Though, honestly, I sometimes forget which year it is anymore. It’s been a long time!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Melvenia. November 12th, 1948. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your health, you mentioned being generally healthy. Could you tell me if you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but physical therapy helped a lot. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but nothing a little walking doesn't fix. Nothing serious, you understand. I don't take any regular medications, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Melvenia. Knee trouble and occasional high blood pressure – thank you for mentioning those. It does matter. Do you recall approximately when you had the physical therapy for your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must have been… around 2018, I think? Maybe 2019? It was right before… well, before everything got so… complicated. It was a good program, though. Really helped strengthen them up. I could walk much better afterwards.
DOCTOR: Excellent. 2018 or 2019 for the physical therapy. And you mentioned your blood pressure sometimes runs a little high. Do you know what your typical blood pressure readings are, or when it was last measured?
PATIENT: You know, I really don’t. It’s been a while since I had it checked. I have a little cuff at home, but I haven’t used it in ages. Honestly, I just try not to eat too much salt and I get a little exercise and it seems to be alright. I don’t go to the doctor much, I avoid it if I can. It's expensive, you know? And… well, I just prefer to handle things myself when I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. It is wise to be mindful of your health and take preventative measures. Given that it's been a while since your blood pressure was checked, and as we are completing these forms, I would recommend we take a reading here today. It would just be a quick check, and it will give us a baseline for your current health status. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose so. If it's really necessary. I just… I don't like needles, and I hope it doesn't take long. And I really would like to get this paperwork finished, Doctor. Is it going to delay things significantly?
DOCTOR: It won't involve a needle, Melvenia. It’s just a cuff around your arm. And it won't take long at all—just a few minutes. It’s important to have an accurate reading, especially as we are completing these forms. It helps ensure everything is complete and correct. If you’re comfortable, we can do it now. Would you like me to explain the process quickly before we begin?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with then. No need to explain, I’ve had my blood pressure taken before. Just… be gentle, please? And hurry, if you don't mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. Your blood pressure is reading 158/92. That is a bit elevated, Melvenia. I would like to discuss this with you further. Do you experience any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is that bad? I don’t… I don’t really notice anything. Sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast, but that’s just… old age, I guess. No headaches, though. And my vision is fine. Well, a little blurry sometimes, but I just need new glasses, I think. This is why I don't like going to the doctor. It's always something. Can we just get back to the forms now? I really need to be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Melvenia. It's not my intention to cause you worry, but a blood pressure reading of 158/92 does require some attention. While we can proceed with the forms, I strongly recommend we discuss potential next steps to manage your blood pressure. Left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to more serious health issues. Before we continue with the paperwork, would you be open to discussing some options, such as lifestyle modifications or potentially a medication consultation?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, really. But I'm 76 years old! I’ve lived a long life, and I'm not looking to start taking a bunch of pills now. I've always managed just fine on my own. No pills, no fuss. I just need these forms signed so I can get on with my day. Can we please just finish the paperwork? I'll be careful, I promise. I'll watch what I eat and try to relax. Just… please. I really don’t want to deal with this right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your wishes, Melvenia, and I respect your autonomy. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure you are fully informed about your health and the potential risks of untreated high blood pressure. While you’ve managed well for many years, a reading of 158/92 indicates a need for intervention. Given your strong preference against medication, we can focus on lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress reduction. But I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment to monitor your blood pressure regularly. Before I sign these forms, I need to document that we discussed your elevated blood pressure and your decision to forego medication at this time. I also want to provide you with some educational materials on hypertension and lifestyle changes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, yes, document whatever you need to. And give me the papers. I’ll… I’ll try to eat better, I guess. And I’ll try to relax. Just… get it over with. And hurry, please. I have things to do. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are the completed forms, Melvenia. And this pamphlet contains helpful information about managing your blood pressure. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month to recheck your blood pressure. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. No follow-up. I’m not coming back. Just… give me the papers. I’ve told you, I'm fine. I'll be careful. Don't bother me again. Thank you for your time.
