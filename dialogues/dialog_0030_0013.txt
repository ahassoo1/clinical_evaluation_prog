DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s startin' to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying can certainly be concerning. When you say “a little while,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three, four months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little slow. But lately, it’s gotten worse. I find myself… straining a bit, and then havin’ to go back a little while later ‘cause it doesn't feel like everything came out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset over three to four months. And you've noticed increased straining and a sensation of incomplete emptying recently. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort while you’re trying to urinate, or immediately afterward?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s… uncomfortable, like I said, havin' to push. But not painful. Sometimes, just a little ache lower down in my belly after I’m done, but that goes away pretty quick. It doesn’t keep me up at night or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with urination, just discomfort and a mild ache afterward that resolves quickly. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… the color or smell? No, not that I've noticed. It looks pretty much the same as always. I drink a lot of water, so it’s usually pretty clear. I haven’t seen any blood or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain alongside this issue?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No fever or chills. My back’s been a little achy sometimes, but that’s just my age, I reckon. I used to do a lot of heavy liftin' when I was younger. It ain’t really connected to… this problem. It’s just… old age catchin’ up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand. And to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t go to the doctor much, if I can help it. But I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was maybe sixty. Other than that… not much. I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that's about it. Oh, and I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cholecystectomy about ten years ago, pneumonia previously, and you're currently taking medication for hypertension, covered by Medicare. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… the bottle’s at home. It’s a little white pill… starts with an “A”, I think. Amlodipine? Is that right? Amlodi… something like that. It’s hard for me to remember those names, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is correct. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicine they’ve given me before. I’m not a fussy eater, and I don't have sensitive skin or nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble when he got older. Lots of heart trouble. And my brother… he had problems with his kidneys, I remember that. But other than that, I don't really know much about my family’s health. We didn't talk about that kind of thing much when I was growin' up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and kidney problems. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now. My wife passed away a few years back. I keep myself busy. I like to fish when the weather’s good. And I do a little bit of woodcarvin'. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with supper sometimes, but that's it. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good lifestyle, Mr. Hilber. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your vital signs, and a quick neurological exam. There will also be a prostate exam. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? Hmm… I’ve heard about those. Not particularly lookin' forward to it, to be honest. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I reckon I’m okay with it. I want to get to the bottom of this problem, whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s a standard part of evaluating urinary issues in men, and it will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual bruits or masses detected. Now I'm going to check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so, and your pulse is normal. Now for the neurological exam, just to check reflexes and sensation. Reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Now, if you’re comfortable, we'll proceed with the prostate exam. I'll explain each step as I go. Would you prefer I call a chaperone in to assist?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. No chaperone needed. Just… get it over with. The quicker, the better. I appreciate you explainin’ everything, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, and it feels a bit firm. There are no obvious nodules or areas of significant tenderness. The exam was a bit uncomfortable, I imagine. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it's likely you have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men your age, where the prostate gland enlarges, causing difficulty with urination. However, to rule out other possibilities and to get a clearer picture, I recommend a urine analysis and a Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, blood test. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: BPH, you say? Enlarged prostate… that sounds about right. I figured it was somethin’ like that. Tests… yeah, sure. Whatever it takes to find out what's goin' on. A urine analysis and a PSA test… okay. Just tell me when and where to do 'em.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will draw the blood for the PSA test right here in the clinic. And I’ll give you a container for a urine sample. I’d like you to collect a “clean catch” sample, which means you’ll need to clean the area before you urinate, and collect the midstream portion of your urine. The nurse will explain the process. We’ll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. We'll discuss the results when they come in, and we can consider treatment options if necessary. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think you’ve covered everything pretty well. Just… how long will it take to get those results back, exactly? And… what kind of treatment options are we talkin' about? Pills? Surgery? I’m a little nervous about surgery.
DOCTOR: It typically takes 3-5 business days for the lab results to come back. As for treatment options, it depends on the severity of your symptoms and the results of the tests. For mild symptoms, we might recommend watchful waiting—monitoring your symptoms without immediate intervention. We can also try lifestyle modifications, like timed voiding and bladder training. If your symptoms are more bothersome, we have several medication options that can help relax the prostate and improve urine flow. These are usually the first line of treatment. Surgery is typically reserved for more severe cases that don't respond to other treatments, or if there are complications. There are several minimally invasive surgical options available now, which have shorter recovery times and fewer side effects than traditional surgery. We wouldn't discuss surgery until we have all the information and have explored all other possibilities. Does that help clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yeah, that does help. Pills first, then maybe… other things if they don’t work. I’m not keen on surgery, so I’m glad to hear there’s other options. You think this… BPH… could be why I have trouble sleepin’ sometimes? I gotta get up a couple of times a night to pee.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very common, Mr. Hilber. Nocturia – the frequent need to urinate at night – is a common symptom of BPH. The enlarged prostate can press on the bladder, reducing its capacity and causing you to wake up more often. Treating the BPH may help improve your sleep. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Quicksey. I appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly. I’ll go see the nurse now to get those tests done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. The nurse is just down the hall, and she'll take excellent care of you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day now. .
