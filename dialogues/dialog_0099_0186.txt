DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Just… the tryout. For the team. Need to get checked out, make sure I’m good to go. Don't want any surprises when I’m out there, you know? It's a bit of a long story why I'm trying out now, but… that’s the short of it.
DOCTOR: A tryout, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. For the… uh… the local basketball team. They're holding open tryouts. I used to play a lot back in the day. Not… professionally, or anything. Just… a lot. Trying to get back into it. Is this… is this going to take long? I have a few things going on.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll try to be efficient. But a proper check-up to ensure you're fit for strenuous activity requires some detail. We need to understand your current health status, any potential risks… It’s not just about if you can play, but making sure playing won't harm you. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Not… really. It’s been a while. I usually just… push through things. Old habits, I guess. Honestly, I’m not sure when the last time was. A long time ago. Is that bad? I feel okay, mostly. A few aches and pains, but… who doesn't at my age?
DOCTOR: It is less than ideal, Mr. Kingan. Pushing through pain can lead to serious problems. We need to establish a baseline. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis... anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Arthritis, maybe? My mother had it, and I’ve got some stiffness in my knees sometimes, but… I never got officially checked. High blood pressure, I don’t think so. Never been told that. Heart… no, nothing with my heart, as far as I know. Honestly, I mostly just ignore things until they really bother me. Sorry, is that helpful? I'm not good at remembering dates or… diagnoses.
DOCTOR: It’s a start. And it’s better to be honest, even if it’s not precise. We'll need to do a physical exam to get a better picture. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Broke my wrist when I was a kid, but they just… put it in a cast. That was… a long time ago. I think it healed okay. It doesn't bother me now. Look, is this all necessary for a basketball tryout? It feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration, but this isn't about just the tryout. It’s about your overall health. A sudden increase in activity level could exacerbate an underlying condition you're not even aware of. We’re checking for potential risks, preventing problems. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. When I was really young, I had a bad case of pneumonia. I was in the hospital for a week, I think. That was… decades ago. Other than that, no. Just the broken wrist and the pneumonia. Nothing serious recently, or… ever, really. Just regular stuff, you know? Colds, the flu… Is this… can we speed this up? I’m starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move onto family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother passed away a few years back. Heart trouble, eventually. She had arthritis really bad for a long time, too. My father… he’s still around, but… we don’t talk much. He lives back in Mongolia. He's… old. I don’t know much about his health. Never really asked. He’s… a stubborn man. Is that important? Family history?
DOCTOR: It's relevant, Mr. Kingan. A history of heart trouble is concerning, especially given your mother's passing. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had any significant medical issues?
PATIENT: Ugh. Not really. Like I said, I don’t keep in touch. I know my grandfather on my mother’s side… he had diabetes, I think. But that’s… second-hand information. From my mother. Honestly, I’m not a very… family-oriented person. I kinda left all that behind a long time ago. Sorry. I’m just… not good at this. Can we just check my blood pressure or something? That feels… concrete.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with the physical exam. We’ll do the basics – blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, range of motion. Then we can discuss possible blood work. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, to be honest. A few painkillers here and there, for headaches, but… nothing serious. Just… the usual. Can we just get this over with? I'm really starting to sweat. Is there air conditioning in here? It’s kinda stuffy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… and try to take a few deep breaths. It's going to be a little tight. Your blood pressure is… 150/90. That’s elevated. Heart sounds are… slightly irregular. A bit of a murmur. Lungs sound clear, but… slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. We're going to need to order some blood work, and I’m strongly recommending an EKG. Your blood pressure and heart sounds are concerning.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound good, does it? An EKG? Blood work? Look, I just wanted to see if I could still play basketball. I didn’t realize this would turn into… this. Is it… is it serious? Can I still try out? Or am I… am I too old? Just tell me straight, Doc. I hate beating around the bush. And how much is all this going to cost? I don't have insurance, you know. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration, but avoiding these tests isn't going to make the situation go away. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and the murmur I detected needs to be investigated. An EKG will help us assess your heart's rhythm, and blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health. Whether you can try out right now is… questionable. Participating in strenuous activity with these findings could be dangerous. As for the cost… an EKG is around $200, and the blood work panel will be approximately $300. I can provide a printout with itemized costs. The clinic does offer a limited discount for uninsured patients, but it won’t be substantial. We can also explore options at a free clinic if cost is a significant barrier. My priority is your well-being, Mr. Kingan. I strongly advise against participating in the tryout until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. We need to rule out any serious underlying conditions before you put your health at risk. .
