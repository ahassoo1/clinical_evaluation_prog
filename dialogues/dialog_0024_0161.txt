DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I look into something… about preventing HIV. She said there’s a pill you can take, even if you’re not… well, you know. I just want to learn more, if that makes sense. I’m Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, preventative measures are… prudent, I suppose. Though, generally, those concerned with HIV transmission are engaging in… higher-risk behaviors. But, regardless. You’re inquiring about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. To properly assess if this is suitable for you, I’ll need some information. Let's begin with a rather… comprehensive overview of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, comprehensive…right. Okay. Let me think. Nothing major, honestly. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, gets worse when it’s cold. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but it’s usually fine if I watch my salt. Otherwise… not much. I have Medicare, if that helps. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Medicare is… relevant for billing, Ms. Trefren, not necessarily your medical suitability. “A little bit of arthritis” and “sometimes high blood pressure” are insufficient details for a proper assessment. We need specifics. When were you diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diagnosed… probably fifteen years ago? Maybe more. It wasn’t a big deal, just started aching. The doctor said it was wear and tear, you know? I didn't even go to a doctor for it for years, just used creams and stuff. And the blood pressure… probably five years ago they told me it was a little high. I try to keep an eye on it. I don’t really remember the exact dates, sorry. I’m not one for remembering numbers.
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… problematic, Ms. Trefren. We’ll proceed, but this complicates matters. Do you currently take any medications for either your arthritis or blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. For the arthritis, I take ibuprofen sometimes when it really flares up. And for the blood pressure… nothing. Like I said, I just try to watch my salt and not get too stressed. My friend, Fatima, she always says stress is the worst for it. I really don't take a lot of pills, Doctor. I prefer not to, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Understandable, Ms. Trefren. However, we must ascertain if PrEP is safe for you. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've had the usual childhood vaccines, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty healthy person for my age. I work outside all day, I eat okay… I just want to be careful, you know? This friend of mine… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: “Healthy” is a relative term, Ms. Trefren. Now, before we delve further into preventative pharmaceuticals, let's address a rather… delicate subject. Can you describe your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… personal, isn’t it? I’m single, I haven’t been with anyone… regularly… in a very long time. It’s not something I talk about much. I just… I’m careful. I really am. But my friend said it's better to be safe, and… this PrEP thing seemed like a good idea, just in case. Is that enough? I don’t really… understand why you need to know all this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, PrEP is not a blanket preventative measure. It is prescribed based on risk factors, and a complete sexual history is paramount. I understand your discomfort, but withholding information hinders my ability to provide appropriate medical care. Have you had any recent unprotected sexual encounters?
PATIENT: Recent? No. Not recently. Look, Doctor, I came here because I want to learn about staying safe. I'm not trying to… hide anything. It's just… it's embarrassing. I haven't been very active, alright? It’s been years. I’m a 55-year-old woman, not some… teenager. Is this really necessary? I just want to know if this pill is something I should consider, and it feels like you're interrogating me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Trefren. Let us move on. We will proceed with some basic bloodwork to assess your kidney function and rule out any existing infections. However, I must reiterate: PrEP is not without risks, and its suitability is contingent upon a thorough understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. I will order the tests now. The lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any further questions… for the moment?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's all for now. Just… the bloodwork, right? And then we'll see if it's… okay for me to take the pill? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… explaining things. Even if it was a bit… much. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Trefren. The results will determine the next course of action. I trust you will contact my office should you experience any… unusual symptoms in the interim. Good day. .
