DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… tingling. It’s mostly in my hands, and sometimes my feet. It’s been going on for a little bit now, and honestly, it’s starting to bother me. I just want to know what it is, you know? I don’t like feeling… off.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Tingling in the hands and feet… I understand wanting to get to the bottom of that. It’s good you came in. Could you describe the tingling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's hard to explain. It's not really painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as strong. And it comes and goes. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days… well, other days it's a bit more annoying. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. "Pins and needles" is a very helpful description. And it’s perfectly alright if explaining things isn't easy; we'll take our time. Now, roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? Around May, I think. It was very mild at first, just a little… odd sensation. I didn’t really pay much attention to it, thought maybe I’d slept on my hand wrong or something. But then it started happening more often, and now… well, now I’m here. It’s been getting… steadier, I guess you’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly three months, starting in May, and gradually becoming more consistent. And you said it affects both your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Not always at the same time, mind you. Sometimes it’s just my hands, sometimes just my feet. And sometimes… both. It seems to be worse in the evenings, I think. After I finish my route. All that walking, maybe? I don't know. I'm a mail carrier, you see, so I’m on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: I see. Being a mail carrier certainly involves a lot of walking, and that’s good information. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things going on with your health. Have you had any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? And I’m 63, you know, things start to ache just from getting out of bed sometimes. No dizziness, no weakness, no trouble with my balance… nothing like that. Just the tingling. It's mostly the tingling, really. I haven't been feeling sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other new symptoms – just the tingling, and maybe some general fatigue, which you attribute to age and activity level. That's helpful. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with… with pills. I stopped taking them a few years back, he said I didn't need them anymore. Aside from that… nothing much, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, it’s been a while. Honestly, I don’t like going to doctors. It never brings good news.
DOCTOR: I understand not enjoying doctor visits, Ms. Uzarski. It’s good you mentioned the high blood pressure, even though it was in the past. And were you taking any other medications currently, or have you recently stopped taking anything besides those blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No, not currently. Just… vitamins, sometimes. A multivitamin, you know, to keep things going. Nothing special. I don't really take much, truthfully. I'm not one for pills if I can avoid it. I like to keep things natural, if you understand. I mostly just try to eat healthy and get enough sleep… though that's easier said than done with my job.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand wanting to keep things natural. And vitamins don't usually interact with much, so that's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I've been lucky that way, thank goodness. I can eat anything, take anything… well, besides being a bit stubborn about pills, I don’t have any problems with them. My husband… he was allergic to bees. But I'm fine. No allergies, thankfully. I’m a pretty simple woman.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Uzarski. No allergies is always helpful. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My family… well, my mother had… something with her nerves, I think. She had trouble walking when she got older, and always complained about numbness in her hands and feet. I don’t really remember what the doctor said it was, it was a long time ago. And my father… he had heart trouble. But aside from that, not much that I know of. We weren’t really a family that talked much about medical things, to be honest. It wasn’t polite, my mother always said.
DOCTOR: I see. So a history of nerve issues in your mother and heart trouble in your father. That’s helpful information, even if it’s not a lot of detail. Okay, Ms. Uzarski, I think I have a good initial understanding of your situation. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? The sooner the better, honestly. I'm a practical woman. Let's just get it over with, so I can get back to work. I have mail to deliver!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Uzarski. I completely understand. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll start with your hands. I’ll ask you to close your eyes and tell me if you can feel when I touch different parts of your hands and feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Close my eyes, you said? Alright. I can do that. Just let me know what you’re doing, so I don’t jump. I don't like surprises! I’ll try my best to tell you what I feel, but sometimes it’s hard to explain, like I said before. Let's just get it done, Doctor. I have a route to finish.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as I go and go at your pace. Okay, Ms. Uzarski, can you feel this light touch on the back of your hand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I can. It feels… normal, I guess. Like a gentle touch. Not too strong, not too weak. Just… normal. Are you checking if I'm still awake? Because I am still awake! I just don’t like being poked and prodded, that’s all. Is this going to take long? My mail…
DOCTOR: No, not checking if you're awake! Just assessing your sensation. And no, it shouldn't take much longer. We’re almost done with the hands. And what about on your fingertips?
PATIENT: Hmm… these… yes, I can feel that too. A little fainter, maybe? Not as strong as on the back of my hand. It's hard to explain, like a… a duller feeling. A little… pins and needles mixed in, maybe? Is that what you’re looking for? It’s not painful, but it’s not… right, you know? Like something isn't quite connecting. Does that make sense? I’m trying to be as precise as possible. It’s just hard to describe!
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. You're being very precise. “A duller feeling with pins and needles mixed in” is very helpful information. Now, let’s check your feet. If you could just extend one leg, please. And same question - can you feel this light touch on the top of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It feels… about the same as my hands, I think. A little fainter, maybe? It's hard to tell, honestly. This foot doesn’t feel much different than the other, to be fair. Is this going to involve poking my toes? Because I hate when people poke my toes! It makes me ticklish and I can’t concentrate. Just tell me if you’re going to poke, please. I'm a practical woman, I can handle it, just give me a warning.
DOCTOR: No toe poking, I promise! We’ll avoid that. And what about on the bottom of your foot?
PATIENT: Hmm… It's… a little numb, maybe? Not completely, but not as strong as the top of my foot. Like a… a fuzzy feeling. Hard to explain, Doctor. Like wearing thick socks, but I'm not wearing socks! Is that making sense? And it's definitely fainter than my hands. It's getting harder to feel things, I think. It's a little… worrying, honestly. My route is getting longer every year, and now this? I just hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. I understand your worry, and we'll work to figure this out. Okay, I’ve finished the sensory examination. Now I'm going to quickly check your reflexes and muscle strength. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I'm doing. Alright, Ms. Uzarski, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Okay, well that’s over with. It wasn’t too bad, I suppose. Just a lot of poking and prodding. So, what did you find, Doctor? Don't tell me it's something serious. I have mail to deliver, you know! Is it something I can fix with some rest, or am I looking at a long time in the doctor's office? Please be quick, I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Based on the physical exam, you have decreased sensation in your hands and feet, more pronounced in your feet, with a slightly diminished reflex response. Your muscle strength appears normal at this time. The findings suggest possible peripheral neuropathy – that's damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. Now, there are many potential causes for this. It could be related to vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, certain medications, or other underlying medical conditions. Your history of high blood pressure could also be a factor. The symptoms you are experiencing are consistent with neuropathy, but further testing is needed to determine the exact cause. Would you be open to getting some blood work to rule out some of the common causes?
PATIENT: Blood work, you said? Oh, goodness. I hate needles. But… if it’s the only way to find out what’s going on… I suppose I can handle a little needle poke, if it means getting back to work. But no poking my toes, Doctor! Promise me, no toe poking! And how long will it take to get the results? I have a route to finish, you know, and I can’t just disappear for weeks. I need to know soon, so I can get back to delivering the mail. And what if it’s… something serious? Please be honest with me, Doctor. I'm a practical woman, I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: No toe poking, I promise you, absolutely no toe poking. And I completely understand your concerns about the blood work and getting results quickly. The blood work will check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and other markers that can help us identify the cause of the neuropathy. It typically takes 2-3 business days to get the results back from the lab. Regarding the possibility of it being serious, it’s too early to say definitively. Neuropathy can range from mild and manageable to more severe, requiring ongoing treatment. In some cases, it can be caused by an underlying medical condition that needs to be addressed. That’s why the blood work is so important. We need to rule out any potential underlying causes and determine the best course of action. I'm going to order the blood work now. The lab is located just down the street at [Lab Name]. They will take your insurance information, and if you are uninsured, we can discuss options for financial assistance. Once the results are back, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms such as weakness, dizziness, or severe pain, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that sounds alright, I suppose. 2-3 days, you said? And you’ll let me know as soon as they come back? Good. No insurance, Doctor. I… I haven't been able to afford it for a while now. Financial assistance, you said? Is that something you can help me with? I don’t want this to be a huge expense. I barely make enough as it is, delivering the mail. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything I can take, or avoid, to help the tingling? I don't want to just sit around waiting for the results. I need to be able to work. Is there anything I can do to make it better? Please, Doctor. I just want to get back to my route.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Uzarski. Don't worry, we will absolutely work with you on the financial aspect. I have information about several local programs that offer assistance with lab costs, and we can explore those options together. We’ll make sure this doesn’t become a financial burden. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do that might help manage your symptoms. First, try to avoid prolonged pressure on your hands and feet. If your job involves repetitive movements, take frequent breaks to rest and stretch your hands and feet. Second, make sure you're wearing comfortable, supportive shoes. Third, staying hydrated is important for nerve health, so drink plenty of water. And finally, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen to help with any discomfort, but always follow the directions on the label. It’s also important to avoid alcohol and smoking, as these can worsen neuropathy. I know it’s easier said than done, but cutting back or eliminating these substances can make a difference. This pamphlet provides additional information about neuropathy, including tips for managing symptoms and lifestyle modifications. Please read through it when you have a chance. We will get to the bottom of this, Ms. Uzarski. And we will work together to find a treatment plan that works for you. Now, do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you for not dismissing me, and for being so… understanding. I know I'm not the easiest patient, always worrying and asking questions. And thank you for the pamphlet. I’ll read it. I just want to get back to work. Delivering the mail… it’s important work. People rely on me. I just want to be able to do my job. So, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. And… I’ll see you in a few days, I suppose? When the results come back? Alright. Thank you again. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I completely understand your dedication to your work. It is important work, and it’s clear you take great pride in it. Yes, we will schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are back. My assistant, Sarah, will be in touch to schedule that. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, we’re here to help. Take care, Ms. Uzarski. And have a good day, despite everything.
