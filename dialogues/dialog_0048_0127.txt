DOCTOR: Right. Gedalya Schaust, 25 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sink. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It's been getting worse over the last few months, I think.
DOCTOR: "Generally weaker," you say. Months, you think?
PATIENT: Yes, months. It’s not like a sudden thing. More… gradual. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, honestly. I just… get tired easier. Things feel heavier to lift, even things that didn't used to bother me. And the eyelids… they’re most noticeable in the evenings, I suppose. But now it's happening earlier in the day too.
DOCTOR: "Easier to tire," alright. And you said the eyelids are drooping. Any double vision?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not that I've noticed. Everything seems… single, if that makes sense. It's just… they feel heavy, and when I look in the mirror, they're lower than they used to be. It doesn't hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like I'm fighting to keep them open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I’ve been a bit more… clumsy, maybe? Dropping things more often. And… I've had some trouble swallowing a couple of times, but it hasn’t been frequent. Just a feeling like the food is… sticking a little. It’s probably nothing, though. I'm not sure if it's related.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing" is what a lot of people say. Difficulty swallowing, you say. And clumsiness… Has this affected your speech at all?
PATIENT: No, my speech is fine, I think. At least, no one has told me otherwise. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not like I’m slurring or anything. Just… I feel a bit more unsteady on my feet sometimes. And maybe a little more tired when I’m talking for a long time. Does that make sense? I really don't know what is going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Just… I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit up there for me. I’ll start with your reflexes. Please let me know if anything feels painful. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Certainly. I will try to relax. It’s just… a little nerve-wracking, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… a little diminished, but not dramatically so. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Now, I'm going to check your eye movements. Follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Hmm. Noticeable… fatigue in the upward gaze. Can you hold your eyes open for me a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… It's… getting harder to hold them open, Doctor. They feel very heavy. It's like… a weight. I'm sorry, it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That’s enough for now. Now, let’s have a look at your throat. Open wide, please. Hmm. Not much to note here. Palate looks normal, no obvious lesions. Let me feel your neck. A few slightly enlarged nodes, but nothing alarming. Okay.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. It feels… strange, but I’m trying to cooperate. What do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I’m getting a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it could be a number of things. It’s too early to say definitively. The drooping eyelids, fatigue, and difficulty swallowing… those can point to a number of neurological issues. Given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And… I think an MRI of the brain would be prudent. It’s just to be thorough.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… is that very serious? What are you looking for, exactly? I’m not sure I understand. And blood work, that’s… alright. It's just… an MRI sounds quite… involved. I haven’t had one before.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, but it's best to get a clear picture. The MRI will help us look at the muscles and nerves around your eyes, and rule out any structural problems. It's a detailed scan, that's all. We need to rule out things like myasthenia gravis or other nerve disorders. And the blood work will give us a baseline to see if anything else is going on. Honestly, it’s standard procedure when presenting with these symptoms. I’ll give you a referral to the imaging center. They'll schedule you for the scan. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? No, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I have any allergies. I’ve had… a few vaccinations, standard childhood ones, but I don't recall anything about dye. So, you think it could be something like… myasthenia gravis? Is that… treatable? I've never heard of it. And how long will it take to get the results of the MRI?
DOCTOR: Myasthenia gravis is a treatable autoimmune disorder. It causes weakness of the muscles, and can affect your eyelids, swallowing, and breathing. However, it’s not always the case. We need the MRI results to confirm or rule it out. As for the timing… the imaging center says it’s about a week to get the results. I’ll have my nurse contact you once they’re available. I’m also going to write you a referral to a neurologist. They’re the specialists in these types of conditions. It’s best to have them review the results and discuss treatment options if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… serious. So, I have to wait a week for the MRI, then another week, maybe, to see a neurologist? That feels like a long time. Is there… anything I can do in the meantime? Will the weakness get worse? And… how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have insurance, as you know.
DOCTOR: It is a wait, I understand. Unfortunately, these tests take time. As for the weakness… it’s difficult to say if it will worsen. Try to avoid strenuous activity, and get plenty of rest. If you notice any significant changes – difficulty breathing, double vision, complete inability to swallow – go to the emergency room immediately. Regarding the cost… I’m afraid I can’t give you an exact figure. The imaging center and neurologist will bill you directly. My office can provide you with a cost estimate, but it will only be approximate. I can also direct you to some resources for financial assistance. We'll do what we can. I have other patients waiting. Do you have any further questions, or can we consider this consultation concluded?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll wait for the nurse to call. .
DOCTOR: Right. Take care.
