DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Your back… worse than usual.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, you know… I had cancer a while back. They got most of it, I think. But my back always hurts a little. Now it’s… sharp. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Makes it hard to stand for long.
DOCTOR: I see. So you had cancer previously, and you’ve been experiencing back pain since then. Now it’s become sharper and is radiating down your leg, making it difficult to stand for extended periods. Is that a good summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. You understand. It’s hard to explain sometimes. It’s not just a dull ache anymore. It’s… like a stabbing pain. And it’s been getting worse the last few weeks. I didn’t want to bother you unless it got really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Stabbing pain" that’s increased over the last few weeks. I appreciate you waiting to see if it resolved on its own before coming in. Can you point to exactly where the pain is worst on your back?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly on this side. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way around, but it starts here. And like I said, down my leg… on the back of my leg, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back, right side, radiating down the back of your leg. Does anything specifically make the pain worse – bending, lifting, twisting, sitting, standing, walking?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things. Bending… definitely. Lifting, even something light. And sitting for too long is bad. Standing isn’t great, but it’s better than sitting. Walking… well, it depends on the day. Some days it’s okay, some days it feels like every step is hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a variety of activities aggravate the pain - bending, lifting, prolonged sitting. It sounds like it fluctuates – better with standing, but inconsistent with walking. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… laying down flat sometimes helps. And if I take it really easy, just resting. But not for long, because then I feel stiff. Hot showers feel good for a little while, too. But it doesn't last.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat, resting, and hot showers offer temporary relief. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in either leg or foot?
PATIENT: Tingling… yeah, sometimes. In my foot, mostly. Like when it’s really bad. Not all the time, though. Weakness… not really weakness, but it feels… heavy sometimes. Hard to explain. Like it’s hard to lift my foot up when I walk. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Tingling in the foot, especially with increased pain, and a sensation of heaviness and difficulty lifting your foot. Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your history. You mentioned you had cancer previously. Do you mind telling me what type of cancer it was and when you were treated?
PATIENT: It was… kidney cancer. A long time ago now. About five years ago, I think. They took out one of my kidneys. I had… chemotherapy, and then some radiation. I don’t remember all the details. It was a hard time. I’ve been going for check-ups ever since, and they always said everything looked okay. But like I said, my back never felt quite right after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, kidney cancer five years ago, treated with chemotherapy and radiation, with regular follow-up appointments. And you've experienced ongoing back discomfort since the treatment. Do you have any other medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure once, but the doctor gave me some pills and it went away. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy. I try to eat good, and I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, generally healthy with a brief history of blood pressure issues. Are you currently taking any medications, other than those for blood pressure if you still take them?
PATIENT: No, not right now. The doctor took me off the blood pressure pills a couple years ago. Just some vitamins, that’s all. And… sometimes I take something for pain, but it doesn’t really help much. Just ibuprofen, you know, over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications other than vitamins, and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with any pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing all this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to have you lie down on your back. Then, I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. I'll also gently move your back and hips to see where you feel pain and assess your range of motion. Please let me know immediately if anything causes significant discomfort. Okay, Ms. Meigs. Your reflexes are normal and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups in both legs, though you do report some discomfort with straight leg raise on the right side at approximately 45 degrees. Sensation is intact to light touch. Palpation reveals tenderness along the lumbar spine, particularly on the right side. Range of motion is limited secondary to pain, especially with flexion and extension. I do not detect any focal neurological deficits at this time.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… complicated. So, what does that mean? Is it the cancer again? That's what I'm scared of.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about the cancer, and that's a very valid question. Based on the exam alone, I don't believe this is directly related to the cancer recurring. The tenderness and limited range of motion suggest a musculoskeletal issue – something affecting the muscles, ligaments, or nerves in your back. The pain radiating down your leg points to possible nerve involvement, potentially a pinched nerve. However, given your history of cancer, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine to assess for any structural abnormalities. I'm also going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine, which will give us a more detailed look at the nerves and soft tissues. This will help us determine the exact cause of your pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… X-ray and MRI. That sounds good, I guess. If it’s not the cancer, what could it be? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: There are several possibilities. A common cause of this type of pain is a herniated disc, where the cushioning between the vertebrae gets pushed out and presses on a nerve. Another possibility is spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal. Muscle strain or ligament sprain can also cause similar symptoms. It’s also possible, though less common, to have a problem with the facet joints in your spine. As for whether it’s serious, it depends on the cause. Most of these conditions are treatable with conservative measures like physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. However, in some cases, surgery may be necessary. We’ll get a clearer picture once we have the results of the imaging studies. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. I’ll also prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help manage your pain and inflammation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay… no lifting, pills, and the pictures. That sounds… a lot. But I guess I have to do it. When will I get the results? And what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a lot, but we’re going to take it one step at a time. The imaging center is right across the street. I’ll have the order sent over electronically. They should be able to get you in today. Typically, the results are available to me within 24-48 hours, so I’ll have my nurse call you with the findings as soon as I review them. And you're right to ask what if it is something more serious. If the imaging reveals a concerning finding, we'll discuss all your options thoroughly. That might include a referral to a specialist - either a spine surgeon or a pain management physician. I'll explain everything in detail and make sure you understand all the risks and benefits before making any decisions. For now, let's focus on getting the imaging done and managing your pain with the medication I'm prescribing. Do you have any questions about the medication, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel a little bit better knowing we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. Remember, we're a team in this. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results are in. Here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant and NSAID, and a written summary of our discussion today. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and try to take it easy.
