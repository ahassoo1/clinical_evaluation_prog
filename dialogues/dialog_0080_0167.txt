DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my foot is giving me trouble. A sore, it is. Been there a little while now, and it’s not getting better. It hurts to walk, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a bit and makes walking difficult. I see. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. Red around the edges, and…well, it looks deep. Not a fresh scrape, you understand. It’s been there…maybe a month or so? My daughter, she says I need to come see someone, because of…the sugar. She worries about my sugar. I have the…the sickness with the sugar.
DOCTOR: Right, a month or so, on the bottom of your foot near your toes, red edges, and looks deep. And your daughter is concerned about it being related to your blood sugar. You mentioned “the sickness with the sugar” – do you mean diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, diabetes, that is what she says. I take the medicine, every day. Little pills. But sometimes…sometimes I forget. Not every day, but sometimes. And I like sweet things, you know? A little mango, a piece of pineapple... It’s hard to say no. Is that bad for the sore?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have diabetes and take medication for it, but sometimes miss doses, and enjoy some fruit. That can definitely affect a sore, especially with diabetes. It can make it harder for wounds to heal. Let’s take a look at the foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. One moment. There. Be careful, it’s tender.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see it. It is on the bottom of your foot, near the base of your fifth toe, approximately 1.5cm in diameter. There’s some redness and swelling around the edges, and it appears to be full thickness – meaning it goes deeper than just the surface skin. It is tender to the touch, as you mentioned. No signs of active infection at the moment, but it definitely needs attention. I’m going to document this as a plantar ulcer. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your feet or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness…sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly in my toes, the little ones. It feels like…like they are wrapped in cotton, you know? Not pain, just…not feeling everything. It’s worse when I walk a lot, or when it’s cold. My daughter says it’s the sugar again.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in your toes, especially the smaller ones, feeling like they’re wrapped in cotton, worse with walking or cold temperatures. That is common with diabetes, and it’s called peripheral neuropathy – nerve damage caused by high blood sugar levels. It's a concern, as it can contribute to wounds like this going unnoticed and becoming more serious. Let's talk about your blood sugar control. Do you check your blood sugar at home, and if so, what are your typical readings?
PATIENT: No, I don’t check it myself. The doctor, he checks it when I come for my appointments. I don’t have one of those…machines. My daughter, she offered to get me one, but I don’t want to bother with it. Too many things to remember! I just take the pills, and try to eat right. Sometimes I fail, but I try. I don’t know what the numbers are. He just tells me if they are…good or bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t check your blood sugar at home, and rely on your doctor’s assessment during appointments. That’s good to know. It sounds like getting a blood glucose monitor might be helpful, but we can discuss that more later. Right now, this sore is my biggest concern. Because of the diabetes and the neuropathy, it’s important we take steps to help it heal and prevent infection. I’m going to order some lab work - a CBC to check for infection and an HbA1c to get a better understanding of your average blood sugar control over the past few months. We will also do an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I can take most anything. My wife, she was the one with allergies. Lots of things bothered her. I just take the pills the doctor gives me. What will the tests tell you? Will they help the sore?
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that’s good. The tests will help us determine if there's an infection already present in the sore, and give us a clearer picture of how well your blood sugar has been controlled recently. Knowing that will help me decide the best course of treatment to help the sore heal. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep pressure off your foot as much as possible. I’m going to give you a prescription for a specialized shoe insert and recommend a walking boot to offload pressure. I will also prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the sore twice a day. Do you have anyone who can help you with applying the ointment and following the instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, my daughter, Leilani, she helps me with things. She’s a good girl. She can help with the ointment, and make sure I’m using the boot. She worries about me, you know? She lives close by. Can she come with me next time? Maybe she can write down the instructions, so I don’t forget.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you have Leilani’s support. Yes, absolutely, she’s very welcome to join you at your next appointment. It's helpful to have someone there to help with remembering instructions and asking questions. To summarise: I’ve ordered blood work and an X-ray. I’m prescribing a specialized shoe insert, a walking boot, and a topical antibiotic ointment. Leilani will help you with these. We'll follow up in one week to discuss the lab results and X-ray and see how the sore is responding to treatment. It’s important that you call me immediately if you notice any signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, pus, or fever. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for letting my daughter come next time. I feel better knowing she can help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I'm glad I could help, and I'm happy Leilani will be able to join us next time. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your appointment. Here's a printed summary of everything we discussed, including the prescriptions and lab orders. The nurse will also review these with you before you leave. Have a good day, and please take care of that foot.
