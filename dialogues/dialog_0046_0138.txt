DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s lovely to meet you too. Dr. Glowka, you said? My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Well, what brings me in… hmm. My daughter, bless her heart, she was the one who made the appointment. Something about… well, she’s worried about these little spells I’ve been having. And my family… there’s been a lot of bad headaches on my mother’s side, and… oh, what was it? Weakness? Yes, weakness, sometimes. It comes and goes. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Tofani. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit fuzzy – that's what I'm here for, to help sort things out. So, these "spells" – can you describe one of those for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… Well, it feels like… a heaviness, mostly. In my arm, usually the right one. Like I’ve been lifting bricks all day, even when I haven’t. And sometimes, the words… they get stuck. Not all the time, mind you, just… a little trouble finding the right ones. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes, and then it’s gone. It’s scary when it happens, though. Makes me feel… off. And then sometimes I get a terrible headache, like a vise squeezing my head, but those aren’t always with the weakness. Does that make any sense? It’s all so jumbled in my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Tofani. It sounds unsettling, but you’re explaining it very clearly. So, the heaviness in your right arm, difficulty finding words, and occasional headaches – and these sometimes happen together, sometimes separately?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sometimes they all happen at once, a real mess. Other times, it’s just the arm, or just the headache. The words… those are the most frightening, I think. Not being able to say what I mean… it’s like being trapped. And it comes and goes, like a little cloud passing over. It’s not constant, thank goodness. But it’s enough to worry my daughter, and she worries me, too. She said something about… a history of this in the family? I remember my mother… she had awful headaches, and… oh, what was it? Something about being weak on one side? It’s all very vague. I was just a little girl then.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s understandable that things are a bit vague remembering back that far. It’s good that your daughter is looking out for you, and we'll definitely explore the family history further. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Past medical history… Let me see. I haven't been seriously ill, not for a long time. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing to write home about. When I was younger, I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And my knees… they bother me, arthritis, the doctor says. Nothing major, just a little ache. I take something for it. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication ever since. Aside from that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I’ve always been a healthy eater, mostly Italian cooking, you know. Lots of vegetables. Is there anything specific you want to know? It’s hard to remember all the details, you see.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. So, gallbladder removal, arthritis in the knees, and managed hypertension – that gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned medication for your blood pressure and knees – can you tell me what medications you’re currently taking, and the dosages if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the medications… Now that’s a tricky one. My daughter handles most of that, honestly. She fills the little pill boxes for me every week. Let me see… I think one is a little white one for the blood pressure… Lisinopril, maybe? She always says the name. And the other one is for my knees, a yellow one, Naproxen, I believe. And sometimes, when it’s really bad, she gives me something stronger, a little blue pill, but I don't know what that is. I take one of each, once a day, usually with breakfast. I really should write these things down, shouldn’t I? I'm terrible with names and numbers these days. You’re very patient with me, dear. It’s kind of you.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Tofani. It's perfectly common to have trouble keeping track of medications, and it’s good your daughter is helping. It sounds like you’re on Lisinopril for your blood pressure and Naproxen for arthritis, and possibly another medication for pain flares – we'll confirm that with your pharmacy records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I’ve eaten everything, you know, Italian cooking… shellfish, nuts, everything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s just the dry air, I think. And I get a little sniffly with dust, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a little tickle in my nose. No, I don’t think I have any real allergies. My daughter always asks me, and I always say no. She worries about everything, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. You mentioned your mother had headaches, and weakness on one side. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had similar issues – headaches, stroke, or any neurological problems?
PATIENT: Oh, the family… that’s a long story. My mother… she had terrible migraines, always had. And she did get weak on one side, near the end. The doctor said it was a stroke, I think. My aunt, her sister, she had something similar, a long time ago. And my cousin, on my father’s side, he had trouble speaking a few years back, but I don’t know what it was. He lives in Italy, you see, so it’s hard to keep track. My daughter asked me about this, too, she’s been doing some research, I think. She said something about… a tendency to blood clots? It’s all a bit hazy. My family… they’re a complicated bunch. I wish I remembered more, but it was so long ago. And everyone always kept things to themselves, you know, Italian families… lots of secrets.
DOCTOR: It sounds like there is some history of headaches and potential stroke in your family, which is helpful to know. And it's not uncommon for families to keep things private. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, bless his soul, he tried it once or twice when he was young, but I wouldn't allow it in the house. Terrible habit. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Mostly water, and a lot of tea. I used to walk a lot, when my knees weren't bothering me so much. Now I mostly sit and read, or watch television. It's a quiet life, but a good one.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no smoking history, minimal alcohol consumption, and you used to be more active. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don't live alone. I live with my daughter, Maria. She's a godsend, really. Takes care of everything. And my grandson, Anthony, he lives just down the street with his wife and little ones. We see them often. I have a few friends from church, but most of them are… well, they’re getting on in years, too. It’s nice to have family close by, though. Maria is always checking on me, making sure I’m alright. She worries so much! But I appreciate it, I really do. It's good to have people around. A quiet life is nice, but it's even better when it's shared.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Tofani. It sounds like you have a strong support system. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your medical history, family history, and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A quick exam sounds fine. My daughter always makes me go to the doctor, anyway. She says I need to be checked up on. I don’t feel much different, but she worries so! Go ahead, dear. I’ll just sit here and be quiet. Just tell me if anything feels… strange. I’m a bit of a worrier myself, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. I’m just going to take your blood pressure first. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your anxiety and that we just discussed it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Arms out, you say? Like this? They feel a bit shaky, you know. I haven't been doing much with them lately. And my hands… they get cold easily. Not much strength in them anymore, I suppose. My daughter says I need to do exercises, but it's hard to get motivated. Just tell me if anything feels wrong, dear. I don't want to cause any trouble. It’s just… I’ve never been very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your grip strength is a bit diminished on the right side compared to the left. Your reflexes are a little brisk, but still within normal limits. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Nose and finger, you say? Oh dear. That was… not very good, was it? My hand… it just doesn't seem to want to cooperate. And my balance… it feels a little wobbly. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, you know. Is something wrong, dear? Are you finding something… concerning? My daughter will be so worried.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Tofani. Don't worry. It’s good we're taking a look. I’m noticing some mild weakness in your right arm and a slight difficulty with coordination. This, combined with your report of spells with heaviness, difficulty finding words, and a family history of stroke, warrants further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'd also like to schedule a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of what's going on. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI? And blood work? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, dear? My daughter was right to worry, wasn’t she? I’ve never had an MRI before. Will it hurt? And what will the blood work show? I don’t like needles, you know. And I’m always a bit anxious about doctors… It’s just… I’m an old woman, and I don’t want any surprises. My daughter will be so upset. She worries so much about me. Will you explain everything to me, dear? Slowly, please. I need to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious, Ms. Tofani. Let's take things one step at a time. The MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging – is a painless imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation and won't hurt at all. You'll lie on a table, and the machine will make some noises, but it's perfectly safe. The blood work will help us check things like your blood sugar, cholesterol, and look for any signs of inflammation or other medical conditions. It will involve a small needle, but it’s quick, and the phlebotomist will be very gentle. The reason I want to do these tests is not necessarily because I think something serious is wrong, but because your symptoms – the spells, the weakness, the difficulty with words, your family history – warrant a closer look. It’s always best to be thorough and rule out any potential causes. We’ll discuss the results of the tests together, and I'll explain everything clearly. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ms. Tofani. And I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… a little less frightening, now that you’ve explained it. No radiation, you say? That’s good. And you say the phlebotomist will be gentle? I do hate needles. My daughter will probably want to come with me for the MRI, will that be alright? She’s very good at calming me down. And… how long will the MRI take? I don’t like being closed in, you know. And when will we get the results? I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. I just want to know what’s going on, and I want to be prepared. It’s just… I’m an old woman, and I don’t want any surprises. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Should I avoid anything? And… will the tests tell us what’s causing the spells?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. It's good to be prepared, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. Absolutely, your daughter can come with you for the MRI – having someone there for support is always a good idea. The MRI usually takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie on a table, and the machine will be open on both ends, so you won’t feel completely closed in. It can be a bit noisy, but we'll provide you with headphones if you'd like. As for preparation, please let me know if you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint, as that may affect the MRI. You can eat and drink normally before the test, and there's nothing specific you need to avoid. The blood work will be drawn today and should be back within a couple of days. The MRI results usually take a bit longer, about 2-3 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. The tests will help us understand the cause of your spells and weakness. They may help us identify a stroke, tumor, or other underlying medical condition. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. I want to assure you, Ms. Tofani, that we’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. We will figure out what's going on, and we will create a plan to help you feel better. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… a little better, now that you’ve explained everything so clearly. No metal, I don’t think. Just a little arthritis. And the tests will help us figure things out, you say? That’s good. My daughter… she’ll be so relieved to know we’re doing something. She’s been worried sick about me. She handles all the appointments and the medication, you see. I’m not very good with these things. I suppose… I’m a little worried about what the tests might show. What if it’s something bad? What if it’s a tumor, like you said? I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. And… will the tests tell us why this is happening? Is it something I did? Is it something I can fix? Oh dear… I’m getting all flustered now. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, Ms. Tofani, and it’s okay to feel flustered. It’s understandable to worry about what the tests might show, but I want to assure you we’ll face whatever the results are together. We are not going to jump to any conclusions before we have the information. While the tests could reveal something serious, they could also show nothing significant, or something easily treatable. It’s important to remember that we are doing these tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, and not necessarily because I suspect something terrible. As for why this is happening, it’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It could be related to a number of factors, such as age, genetics, or underlying medical conditions. It’s not necessarily something you did, and it’s not something you should feel guilty about. Feeling normal again is absolutely not too much to ask. That’s what I’m here for, to help you feel your best. Once we have the test results, we can discuss the best course of action to get you back on track. We'll explore all possible options, and we will work together to create a plan that’s right for you. I’m going to order the blood work now, and I’ll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… reassuring, dear. Thank you. You’re very kind. I think… I think that’s all for now. My daughter will probably have more questions, but I’m getting a little flustered, as you said. I suppose… I just need to take things one step at a time, like you said. And try not to worry too much. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, dear. You’ve put my mind at ease, a little bit. I appreciate your patience with me. I’m an old woman, and I don’t always understand these things. I think… I think I’ll just go home now and have a cup of tea. And try to relax. Thank you again, dear. You’re a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. It was my pleasure. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And you’re right, taking things one step at a time is the best approach. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. She'll explain the process to you. And I'll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Go home and relax, Ms. Tofani. Have a cup of tea, and try not to worry. And remember, I’m here to help. Oh, and one more thing: I’ll send your daughter a copy of the test orders so she knows what to expect.
