DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re 87 years young. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well. It’s about my… employment. Though, frankly, I don’t see what a doctor can do about it. It’s the students, you see. Utterly lacking in respect for knowledge these days. It’s… stressful. A complete waste of my time, really. I’d prefer to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand you're feeling stressed due to difficulties with students at your place of employment. While I may not be able to directly resolve issues at work, I am happy to assess how this stress is impacting your overall health. To begin, could you tell me a little more about what’s been happening?
PATIENT: Happening? What hasn’t been happening? They don't listen. They arrive unprepared, ask foolish questions… it’s a constant battle against ignorance, I assure you. I’ve been a Library Science Teacher for… well, a very long time. They simply don’t appreciate the value of a proper education anymore. Honestly, I don’t even recall the specifics. It’s just… draining. Is this going to take long? I have a rather important book cataloging project waiting for me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of stress related to your work environment. It is not uncommon for long-term professionals to feel this way. To get a better understanding of how this stress is affecting you, could you describe some of the physical or emotional symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, good heavens. I’m eighty-seven years old, Doctor. What symptoms don't I have? A bit of… fatigue, perhaps. And a general…discontent. It’s difficult to sleep, though that’s likely due to the neighbors’ infernal racket. It’s all connected, you see. The youth, the noise, the disrespect… it all contributes to a general state of… unwellness. I don't believe I require a detailed assessment of my ailments. It’s obvious, isn’t it? A lifetime of wasted effort. Can we simply be done with this?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you've been feeling quite overwhelmed. While it may seem obvious, documenting these feelings and ruling out any underlying medical causes is still important. Just to clarify, when you say difficulty sleeping, is it trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Both, naturally. What a ridiculous question. I lie awake, stewing over the inadequacies of modern education, and then I’m disturbed by the aforementioned racket. It’s a vicious cycle, you see. I’m a light sleeper; always have been. A keen mind is easily distracted. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see how this is relevant. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging my personal misfortunes? It feels rather…demeaning. I would prefer to leave now.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Mr. Schlatterer. My intention is to understand how these disturbances are impacting your overall health. Difficulty sleeping can contribute to fatigue, irritability, and other symptoms, and it’s important to address those. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Heavens. Where do I even begin? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A very long life. Various aches and pains, the usual ailments of old age. I had a rather nasty bout of influenza in ’88, and a minor operation on my knee sometime in the nineties. Honestly, it’s all rather hazy. It’s all documented with my physician, Dr. Petrova. I assure you, I’m not about to recite my entire medical record to you. I simply don’t have the patience. I’ve told you all you need to know. It's stress. A lifetime of dealing with… them. Can we conclude this, please? I have responsibilities. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you have a long-standing relationship with Dr. Petrova, and I certainly don’t want to duplicate her efforts. To clarify, are you currently taking any medications?
