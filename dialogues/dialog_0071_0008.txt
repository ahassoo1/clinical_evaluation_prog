DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Galena. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. My ear. It feels… blocked, mostly. Full. It’s been… a while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear… and you said it’s been going on for a while. Fuzzy is… understandable. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. Just to clarify, is it completely blocked, or is there some hearing?
PATIENT: Some hearing, yes. It’s just… muffled. Like there’s cotton in it, maybe? Not painful, thankfully. Just… annoying. Really annoying. I keep having to ask people to repeat themselves, which… well, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right, muffled hearing, no pain… that’s good. And it’s just the one ear, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, just the left one. The right one seems fine. I… I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Sorry. Things aren't what they used to be, you know? It just… gradually got worse, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Memory can be… tricky. Let's see... okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No dizziness, no… ringing, I don’t think. Maybe a little bit of… pressure sometimes? Not always. It’s hard to say. I mostly just notice the quietness. And having to ask people to repeat themselves. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Asking people to repeat themselves is a sign something’s going on, yes. And the occasional pressure is good to know. Have you had any discharge from your ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? No, no discharge. Definitely not. I… I would remember that, wouldn’t I? Everything feels a bit dry, maybe, but nothing… coming out of it. I keep it pretty clean, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no discharge. Good. Now, have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies that might be contributing?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Yes, I think so. Hay fever, mostly. It’s been a bad year for it, I think. Lots of sneezing, itchy eyes… but I take something for it. A… a tablet. I can’t remember the name, sorry. And… I had a bit of a sniffle a few weeks ago, maybe? Nothing major, just a little cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, allergies and a recent cold. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ear, if that’s alright. It will only take a moment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Go ahead. Just… don’t poke too hard, please? It’s a bit sensitive, you know. I’ll tell you if it hurts. Quick is good. Very quick is best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Just relax. Hmm. Okay… I see some slight redness inside the ear canal, and a little bit of fluid behind the eardrum. The eardrum itself doesn’t appear to be perforated, which is good. It looks like you have some fluid build-up, likely related to the allergies and recent cold. This is quite common.
PATIENT: Right. Fluid, you say? So it’s not… serious? I was worried it was something awful. I… I don’t do well with being ill, you know? Especially with… everything else.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like anything awful at all. It’s likely a build-up of fluid from the allergies and recent cold, causing the muffled hearing. It’s quite common, and usually clears up on its own. We can try a few things to help it along. First, I recommend continuing to take your allergy medication as directed. Secondly, we can try a decongestant. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, that might prevent you from taking one?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… hmm. I think… I think my wife mentioned something about it, years ago. But I don’t take anything for it. She usually handled all that. Honestly, I can’t remember. Is there a way to… check? Or maybe just avoid the decongestant? I’d rather not risk anything.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible. Given the uncertainty about your blood pressure, let’s avoid the decongestant for now. We can certainly manage this without it. I'm going to recommend a course of saline nasal spray, used several times a day. This will help to clear the nasal passages and hopefully reduce the fluid build-up in your ear. I’ll write out instructions for you. I’m also going to recommend returning in two weeks if the muffled hearing doesn’t improve. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Saline spray, two weeks. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you not making me take anything complicated. I should probably get going. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Just remember to follow the instructions, and don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And if the hearing gets significantly worse, or you develop any pain, please come in sooner. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care now.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you again, Doctor Galena. You too. .
