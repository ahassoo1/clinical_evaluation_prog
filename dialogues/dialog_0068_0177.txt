DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Well, it's... down there. Somethin's not right. Leakin' a little bit, you know? Not supposed to do that at my age. It’s…uncomfortable. Don’t even ask me how long, I forget these things. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, "down there"... leaking and uncomfortable. I understand. It can be… distressing. Can you tell me a little more about the leaking?
PATIENT: Distressin’? Hmph. It's just… a little wet. Not a flood, mind you. Just… noticeable. Like after… well, never you mind. It’s clear, I think. Or maybe whitish? I dunno. Honestly, I don't go lookin' at it too close. It just feels… wrong. Like somethin's drippin' when it shouldn't be. It’s been happenin’ off and on, I guess. A few days now? Maybe longer. Time just… goes.
DOCTOR: A few days, maybe longer… clear or whitish discharge… happening off and on. Right. And is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Odor? Like a smell? Well, now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not a bad bad smell, but… fishy? Is that how you say? Not like I’m sleepin’ with a fish or somethin’, but kinda like… the ocean, I guess. A little. It's probably just me. Old ladies smell funny, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. A fishy odor can be… significant. And you mentioned discomfort… can you describe that discomfort?
PATIENT: Significant? What’s significant about it? It just… itches sometimes. And feels… kinda burny when I go pee. Not every time, mind you. Just sometimes. It's not like a real bad pain, you know? Just… irritatin’. Like somethin's not clean enough. I keep washin’ it, but it doesn’t always help. It’s just…a nuisance, really. Old bodies do funny things.
DOCTOR: Itching, burning with urination… that does sound like something we need to investigate. Do you have any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? Nah, I don't think so. I feel warm, maybe, but that's just the weather. Hot as blazes out there, you know? No shivers or nothin’. Just… regular old lady warm. And I ain't been feelin' sick, nothin' like a cold or the flu. Just… this problem. Down there. It’s embarrassing talkin’ about this with a young man, you know. It ain’t proper.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be uncomfortable to discuss these things, Ms. Genard, but it’s important for your health. No fever, that’s good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bladder habits?
PATIENT: Bladder habits? What does that mean? Like… do I go to the bathroom? Yes, I go to the bathroom! What kind of question is that? I go when I need to go, same as always. Maybe I go a little more often now, but that’s probably just ‘cause I’m drinkin’ more water. It's hot, remember? Gotta stay hydrated. Don't make me explain everything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I apologize if my questions seem… direct. We just need to rule things out. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted… Now see here, Doctor. I am a respectable woman! I've lived a good life, and I certainly haven’t been… gallivantin’ around! What kind of implication is that? Don’t you go lookin’ at me like that, young man. That is a very rude question! I may be old, but I know what things mean. And I certainly didn’t come here for that kind of examination.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, please. I didn’t mean to offend you. It’s standard medical procedure to ask about medical history, and that includes STIs, regardless of age. It’s not a judgment, it's simply to ensure we have a complete picture. I apologize if I worded it poorly. Let's put that aside for now. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, that’s a better question. Still rude to ask about… that other thing. But allergies… let me think. I used to be allergic to penicillin, I think. A long time ago. But that was… decades. I don’t even remember if I still am. Maybe. I took some antibiotics once and got a rash, but I get rashes easy. I’m allergic to a lot of things, probably. Dust. Cats. Bad attitudes. You name it. Doesn’t matter much. I just suffer through it.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible penicillin allergy… rash. Noted. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications… Not really. Just some vitamins. Old lady vitamins, you know? For my bones. And sometimes I take something for my… what’s it called… arthritis? In my knees. But that’s it. Just the vitamins and the knee pills. I don’t like takin’ too many pills. They make me feel funny. And they’re expensive. Old age is expensive, you know. Everything hurts, and everything costs money.
DOCTOR: I understand. Vitamins and something for arthritis. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to take a closer look. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, Ms. Genard. It'll help me understand what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? You mean… down there? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. I came here to talk about it, not have you pokin’ and proddin’. I don’t appreciate that at all. I thought you were a professional. I'm an old woman! I’ve been examined enough times in my life. No, I don’t think so. I'd like a second opinion. And I'd like a different doctor. I’m not comfortable with this. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, please wait! I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. I simply wanted to rule out a few possibilities. I understand your hesitation. I can certainly arrange for a referral to another doctor, if that’s what you prefer. I will note your concerns in your chart and ensure the next physician is aware of your discomfort. I will also write you a prescription for a course of antibiotics, to start, while you await a second opinion. It's a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and may help with a potential infection. It’s better to be cautious. Please contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And again, I apologize for any distress I’ve caused.
