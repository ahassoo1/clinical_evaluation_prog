DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Tkac, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. My name is Lennie Tkac. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am here today because I am hoping to be cleared to move into the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. They requested a doctor's visit before I can be accepted, you see. A formality, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A pre-admission physical is pretty standard. Let me pull up your information here… Alright, Lennie Tkac, 81 years old. And Meadowbrook, excellent. So, just to confirm, you're generally feeling well and looking for clearance to move in?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. I am in good health, as far as I know. I bake every day, you see, and that keeps a man active. Though, my bones do ache a little sometimes, as you might expect at my age. But nothing that stops me. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. I keep myself busy, and I believe that is the key.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, staying active is so important. Stiffness in the mornings, okay. And how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Perhaps…oh, a good five years now, I would say. It comes and goes with the weather, mostly. Worse in the cold, naturally. It doesn't bother me enough to see a doctor about it regularly, just a little something I've learned to live with. It fades after I’ve been up and moving for a bit, kneading dough, mostly. Baking is good for the soul and the joints, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely agree about baking! So, five years of morning stiffness, worse with the cold, improves with activity. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints, or redness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no swelling or redness. It’s not like that at all. It's more…a tightness, a resistance when I first get up. Like an old door that needs oiling, perhaps. It goes away quickly, once I get moving. And it doesn't hurt, not really. Just…uncomfortable. I've never had any swelling, no. And I haven't noticed any fever or anything like that with it, either. I remember my grandmother had similar things, and she lived to be ninety-two, baking pies all the while.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your grandmother. Okay, no swelling, no redness, no fever, just morning tightness that improves with activity. Have you had any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Well…my lower back sometimes bothers me if I’ve been lifting heavy bags of flour. Not often, though. I try to be careful. And my feet ache a little at the end of the day, naturally. I am on my feet quite a bit, you see, and a man’s feet are bound to complain after eighty-one years. But nothing that a good soak in warm water won’t fix. I wouldn’t say they are pains, exactly. More…a general weariness. Nothing that stops me from baking, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back with heavy lifting, and some foot weariness at the end of the day. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As far as serious illnesses, I had the measles as a boy, naturally. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But nothing that required any long stays in the hospital, thank goodness. When I was in my fifties, I had my gallbladder removed. It was causing me some trouble, but the surgery went well, and I haven't had any problems with it since. Otherwise…just the usual colds and flu over the years. I've been fortunate, I believe. I’ve always been a strong man, and I try to eat well. Mostly. Do you need to know about any… medications I’ve been taking? I don’t take many.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No major medical history otherwise. And yes, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see…I take a small tablet for my blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Just one a day, prescribed by Dr. Henderson, my previous doctor. And sometimes, if my arthritis is particularly bothersome – that’s what I call the stiffness, you see – I take a couple of ibuprofen tablets. But not every day, only when I need them. And…oh, yes. I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter months. Dr. Henderson suggested it, said it was good for the bones. Otherwise…nothing else. Just a little honey in my tea sometimes, if I have a sore throat. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Honey definitely counts! Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D. Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. As far as I know, I have no allergies. I've never had any reactions to any medications. And I'm not allergic to any foods, either. I eat pretty much everything. Though, I don't care for licorice, if that counts. But that's a matter of taste, not an allergy. I've never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, either. I’ve been fortunate in that regard as well. My wife, bless her soul, was allergic to cats, but I've never had any allergies myself.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No allergies, excellent. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My father lived to be eighty-five, a strong man like myself. He was a rancher, mostly. He died of a heart attack, unfortunately. My mother lived to be ninety, though she was frail in her later years. She suffered from arthritis, much like I do. My sister, she passed away a few years ago at the age of seventy-eight from…well, from a sickness. I don't recall the details, it was a long time ago. And my brother is still living, though he's a bit older than me, and lives out in California. He's in good health, as far as I know. Mostly heart trouble, I believe. Nothing too serious. Does that give you what you need, Doctor? It’s difficult to recall everything after so many years.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Heart attack in your father, arthritis in your mother, and heart trouble in your brother. Okay. Now, one last set of questions before we do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well… I lived with my wife for sixty years, bless her soul. She passed away five years ago. It’s been lonely since then, I won't lie. We didn’t have any children, unfortunately. I spent my life as a baker, you see. Ran my own shop for forty years. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. I still bake every day, keeps me busy. I used to be very active in the community, helped out with the church, volunteered at the local school. But I’ve slowed down a bit in recent years. I don’t get out much anymore, mostly stay at home. And I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I enjoy reading and listening to the radio. Does that cover what you need, Doctor? I’m a simple man, really.
DOCTOR: That gives me a very good picture, thank you. Alright, Mr. Tkac, just a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed as you see fit. I am ready whenever you are. I have always believed in listening to the wisdom of doctors.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 138 over 72. Not bad. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And finally, I'm going to check your range of motion in your joints. Some stiffness in your shoulders and hips, as you mentioned, but no significant pain with movement. Overall, everything looks good. Nothing concerning. Now, do you have any questions for me before we discuss next steps?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds…satisfactory, I suppose. You seemed to find nothing amiss, which is a relief. I appreciate you taking the time to be so thorough. I suppose the question is, does this mean I am cleared to move into Meadowbrook? Is that what you will be telling them? I am eager to get settled in, and perhaps make some new friends. It’s been lonely, as I mentioned, and I believe a change of scenery would do me good.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac, based on my examination today, I absolutely see no medical reason why you wouldn't be able to move into Meadowbrook. You're in generally good health for your age, and the stiffness we discussed is likely just age-related changes. I'll send a note to Meadowbrook confirming your fitness for independent living. I’ll also include a brief summary of our conversation, just for their records. Is there anything specific you’d like me to mention in the note?
PATIENT: That is wonderful news, Doctor. Truly wonderful. No, I believe you have covered everything perfectly. Perhaps you could mention that I remain quite active, despite my age? That I still bake every day. I believe that is important. And that I am…eager to participate in the community, should the opportunity arise. Otherwise, I leave it to your good judgment, Doctor. You have been most kind and thorough. I truly appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll make sure to include that you’re active and eager to participate in community activities. Here’s a copy for your records. I’m sending the same information electronically to Meadowbrook right now. Do you have any other questions for me at all before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is everything. You have answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns. I am very pleased with the care I have received today. Thank you again for your time and attention. I suppose…I wish you all the best in your practice. And thank you again for giving me the green light to move into Meadowbrook. It means a great deal to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. And you take care now, and enjoy your move to Meadowbrook. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. .
