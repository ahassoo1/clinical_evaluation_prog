DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Batara. I believe my niece, Sarah, arranged this visit. She’s quite concerned about me… wants to be certain I’m… suitable, I suppose you could say, for the Meadowbrook facility. A lovely place, from what she tells me, but I understand they need a proper check-up before accepting anyone. I am happy to cooperate fully, of course. Just an old man wanting to make sure everything is in order.
DOCTOR: Meadowbrook, yes. Assisted living. Right. Well, "suitable" is a rather… blunt way of putting it, but I understand. Sarah’s concern is perfectly reasonable. Let's start with why you think you might need a check-up. Are you experiencing any difficulties with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Difficulties… not exactly. Things aren't quite as they were, naturally. I’m eighty-one years old, you know. Baking… it takes a bit longer now. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be when frosting cakes, for example. And remembering recipes… sometimes I need to look them up, even ones I’ve made a hundred times. But I still can do it. I just… I don’t want to be a bother to anyone, should I be needing a great deal of help. That’s what Sarah worries about, I believe.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some slowing down, a little trouble with memory… perfectly normal for your age, Mr. Tkac. But we need to determine the extent of it. Let’s go through some questions, if you don’t mind. It’ll help me get a clearer picture. First, regarding your memory… beyond recipes, are you having trouble remembering appointments, or perhaps names of people you’ve known for a long time?
PATIENT: Appointments… Sarah usually handles those now, to be truthful. I do sometimes forget what day it is, if I haven’t written it down. And names… well, that’s been happening for a while, even before Sarah stepped in. Not close friends, mind you. More… acquaintances. People I see at the grocery store or church. I recognize their faces, mostly, but the names… they slip away. It's frustrating, but not alarming, at least not to me. I wouldn’t say it’s kept me from a good life, but I can see why it concerns my niece.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Grocery store acquaintances… understandable. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been fortunate, all things considered. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but it’s managed with some cream and gentle exercise. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I wear glasses, as you can see. Other than that… the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. Nothing serious, never anything that’s required a hospital stay. I’ve always been a strong man, Lakota blood, you know. Good constitution. I have had my blood pressure checked regularly, though. Sarah insists on that.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your EHR information here… Sarah does seem quite thorough. Okay, I see some records here from Dr. Olsen… arthritis, as you said, and hypertension, controlled with lisinopril. Any other medications you’re taking currently?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, yes, that’s right. And… let me think. Oh, there’s a small dose of something for my knees, a cream, as I mentioned. Can’t recall the name at the moment. Sarah keeps track of all that, really. She has a chart on the refrigerator with all the dosages and times. I just… apply the cream and take the pill when she tells me to. It's easier that way, to be honest. I'm not good with remembering those little details anymore. Perhaps she can provide a more complete list?
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful that Sarah manages your medications, certainly. But it would be far more helpful if you could recall what you're taking. We need to establish your baseline independently. Alright. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, Lakota food, American food… never had a reaction. Dust bothers me a little, sometimes, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just… makes me sneeze. I’ve never had a bad reaction to a medication, either. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Again, Sarah might have something on her list… she’s very thorough about these things. I truly don't keep track myself, Doctor. I bake, I don't worry about allergies.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s try a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a general sense of things. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A bit creaky this morning, if you don't mind. I haven't been as active lately, with the weather being so warm. Baking keeps me busy, but it doesn't require a great deal of… movement, you see. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just walk a few steps forward, and then turn around. Hmm. Slightly wide-based gait, some postural instability… not alarming, but worth noting. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Two plus, bilaterally. Good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Heart sounds regular, slight crackles in the lower lobes, likely from age or mild congestion. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not critically so. Alright. That’s a basic assessment. Now, just to clarify a few things… when you say “memory slipping,” can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Specific example… hmm. Well, just yesterday, Sarah was telling me about her son, little Timmy, and his baseball game. She said he hit a home run, a grand slam, and I… I knew she’d told me, but I couldn’t recall the details. The score, who they played against, anything. I knew it was good news, of course, but the specifics… they just vanished. And sometimes… when I’m baking, I’ll start a recipe, and halfway through, I forget what step comes next. It’s not often, but it’s frustrating. It feels like… like a missing piece, you know? Like a word on the tip of my tongue. Not a complete loss, just… elusive. It’s not as if I forget who Sarah is, or how to bake a cake, just… the small things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, difficulty recalling recent events and some minor forgetfulness… perfectly normal for someone your age, Mr. Tkac. However, we should rule out anything more serious. Given your age and some of these symptoms, I recommend a cognitive assessment. It’s a simple test that can help us assess your memory and thinking skills more thoroughly. And a basic blood panel to check for any underlying issues. It's just a precaution. We will also need to look at a Vitamin B12 level and thyroid panel. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A cognitive assessment… and blood work. Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it will put Sarah’s mind at ease, and ensure I’m… suitable for Meadowbrook, then I’m happy to comply. Though, I must confess, I’m not fond of needles. But if it’s necessary, then so be it. Just… please be gentle. And perhaps I could have a small cookie afterwards? Baking always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: A cookie… We can certainly discuss that. Alright, I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule you for the cognitive assessment next week. It’ll take about an hour. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose vitamin D supplement. It can help with overall health. And I recommend continuing to stay active, even if it’s just gentle walking. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. Sarah will likely have a list of questions later, but for the moment… I think I’m good. I trust your judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to address my niece’s concerns. And if I do remember any questions, I’ll be sure to ask the nurse when she draws the blood. Thank you, Doctor Batara. I suppose it’s time to get poked, then. Perhaps I’ll bake some extra cookies before then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly. .
