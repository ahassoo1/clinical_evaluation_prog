DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because my husband – a very practical man, you understand – insists I get one of these… advance directive forms. Or a POLST, he said. Honestly, I don’t quite see the necessity, but he’s quite insistent when he gets an idea in his head. I suppose it’s better to appease him than to argue.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Marija. It's good of you to come in, and it's very common for spouses to encourage these important conversations. It sounds like your husband is thinking ahead, which is wise. These forms – advance directives and POLSTs – are about making sure your wishes are known should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. To clarify, are you primarily interested in completing an advance directive today, or were you hoping to discuss both an advance directive and a POLST form?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea what the difference is. He simply said I needed one of these documents, and then mentioned POLST as well. He reads a great deal online, you see, and sometimes I think he gets carried away with these… medical things. Perhaps the advance directive is the simpler one? If there is a simpler one. I just want to get this done and be finished with it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Marija. Many people find the terminology confusing. Let me explain. An advance directive is a broader document outlining your overall wishes for medical care – things like what kind of treatments you’d want if you were seriously ill, and who you’d want to make decisions for you. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific form, usually for people with serious illnesses, and it translates your wishes into medical orders for immediate use by healthcare professionals. It’s more often used when you’re already facing a life-limiting condition. For someone who’s generally healthy, like you, an advance directive is usually the more appropriate starting point. We can focus on that today. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An advance directive, then. Less… drastic, if you understand. I’m a healthy woman, as you said. I do take a daily walk, and I’m very careful with my diet. I certainly don’t want to be discussing these… orders, as you call them. Who decides what’s appropriate, exactly? My husband keeps mentioning things, but he’s not a doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask that, Marija. You decide what's appropriate. The advance directive is entirely your document, reflecting your values and wishes. My role is to explain the options and ensure you understand the potential consequences of each choice. Your husband's input is valuable, of course, but the final decisions are yours. We'll go through a series of questions to help you articulate those wishes. Things like whether you'd want life-sustaining treatments in certain situations, and who you’d trust to make medical decisions if you were unable to. Before we start, do you have any existing medical conditions or a primary care physician I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no existing conditions. Perfectly healthy, as I said. I see Dr. Ben-Ari, but he’s… a very busy man. He mostly prescribes my yearly flu shot and tells me to walk more. He wouldn’t know the details of my health, honestly. I’ve always been rather… robust. This whole conversation is rather unsettling, you know. All this talk of… what if. It’s rather morbid.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It is unsettling to think about these things, even for those of us in medicine. And it's perfectly normal to feel that way. We’re simply planning ahead, ensuring your voice is heard should the need ever arise. It's not about predicting the future, but about being prepared. Since you're generally healthy and don't have a primary care physician who knows your detailed medical history, we'll focus primarily on your values and preferences. Before we delve into the specifics of the advance directive, let's briefly touch on your family medical history, if you’re comfortable sharing that. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well… my mother, God rest her soul, suffered from… a decline. A gradual fading of her mind. Not Alzheimer’s, precisely, the doctors said it was… something else. Dementia, perhaps? It was very distressing for all of us. My father, he died of a heart attack, quite suddenly. A very strong man, he was, so it was a shock. And my brother… he had cancer, lung cancer, years ago. He smoked, you see. A foolish habit. I suppose that’s the extent of it. Nothing… remarkable beyond that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Marija. That provides some helpful context. A history of dementia, heart disease, and lung cancer in your family is important to consider. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll experience those conditions, but it’s good to be aware of the potential risks. Now, thinking about your own wishes, let’s start with a somewhat difficult question. If you were facing a serious medical condition where there was little hope of recovery, and life-sustaining treatment would only prolong your suffering, would you want those treatments, or would you prefer comfort care?
PATIENT: Comfort care, absolutely. Prolonging suffering… what is the point? My mother… the final months were… difficult. I do not wish that upon myself, or my family. I’ve always believed in… dignity. And dignity is lost when one is merely… existing. I want to be peaceful, if the time comes. No machines, no tubes. Just… peace. Is that… understandable?
DOCTOR: That is very understandable, Marija, and a very thoughtful response. You've articulated your wishes very clearly. Comfort care, prioritizing peace and dignity, is a perfectly valid and common preference. To ensure your wishes are legally documented, we need to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so yourself. Have you already thought about who you would want to serve as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Of course. My husband, Hamid. He is… practical, as I said. And he is… resolute. He would ensure my wishes are followed. He can be… stubborn, at times, but he means well. He would not let the doctors… overstep. He knows me, you see. Better than anyone. Is there… paperwork involved? I do dislike paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some paperwork involved, I'm afraid, but we'll take it slowly. It's mainly a form that officially designates Hamid as your healthcare proxy and outlines his authority to make decisions on your behalf. It also allows you to specify your preferences regarding specific medical treatments – things like artificial nutrition, hydration, and resuscitation. We can go through each section together, and I’ll be happy to explain anything that’s unclear. Before we begin, is there anyone else you would like to include in these discussions?
PATIENT: No, no one else. Just Hamid. He is… sufficient. He worries, you see, and he asks questions. He is… thorough. It’s best to simply include him, and be finished with this. I trust him implicitly. Although… he does tend to second-guess the doctors. But that is… a minor flaw. Let us simply begin with the paperwork, then. I confess, I find all this… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. We'll take our time and go through each section together. I completely understand your discomfort, and I'll do my best to make the process as smooth and straightforward as possible. First, let’s focus on the healthcare proxy designation. This section simply requires you to formally name Hamid as your proxy and provide his contact information. Do you have his full name and date of birth handy?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. His name is Hamid Ben-Ali. And his date of birth is… February 14th, 1963. He will be pleased I remember. He often… misplaces things. A charming flaw, I suppose. Though occasionally… inconvenient. Is that… sufficient? Perhaps a photograph would be helpful? He has a very… distinctive mustache.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Marija. February 14th, 1963. Thank you. A photograph isn’t required, but if you’d like to include one, that’s certainly acceptable. It can be helpful for identification purposes. Now, this next section asks about your general values and beliefs regarding medical treatment. It’s a series of statements, and you simply indicate whether you agree or disagree with each one. For example, one statement might be, “I value prolonging life above all else, even if it means enduring significant pain and suffering.” Do you feel comfortable reading these statements together, or would you prefer I explain them to you one by one?
PATIENT: One by one, please, Doctor. I confess, I find these… philosophical questions rather daunting. I am not a scholar, you see. I teach literature, but that is… different. Stories, characters… not… values. Please, proceed slowly. And do not hesitate to explain if I am… unclear. This is all rather… exhausting, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. We’ll take it at your pace. I'll explain each statement carefully, and there's no need to feel rushed. Alright, let's start with the first statement. It reads: "I want to be kept alive for as long as possible, even if there is little hope of recovery." Do you agree with this statement, disagree with it, or are you unsure?
PATIENT: I… disagree. Absolutely disagree. What is the point of… existing, merely? If there is no hope, no quality of life… then it is simply prolonging suffering. It is… undignified. I want peace, Doctor. Not… a prolonged existence. Is that… clear? This is rather difficult, you know. Thinking about… the end.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly clear, Marija. And it’s brave of you to articulate such a difficult decision. You've thought about this carefully, and your wishes are being documented. So, we'll mark "disagree" for that statement. Now, the next statement reads: “I want to be fully informed of all medical options, even if the information is complex or distressing.” Do you agree, disagree, or are you unsure?
PATIENT: I… agree. Yes, I want to be informed. I may not understand everything, but I want to know. I do not want to be… kept in the dark. It is my body, my life. I trust my doctors to explain things, even if it is… difficult. And I trust my husband to ask questions if I am… unclear. Yes, I agree. Fully informed. Is that… sufficient? I confess, all these… statements are rather morbid.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Marija. It's good to know you want to be fully informed. That's a very reasonable preference, and we will certainly respect that. Now, the next statement reads: "I want to be kept as comfortable as possible, even if it means receiving medication that may shorten my life." Do you agree, disagree, or are you unsure?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely agree. Comfort above all else. If the medication… hastens things, then so be it. Prolonging suffering is… unacceptable. As long as I am… peaceful. No pain, no distress. That is all I ask. It seems… logical, does it not? What is the point of… a prolonged, agonizing existence? Yes, absolutely agree. Is that… sufficient? This is… exhausting, you know. All this… thinking.
DOCTOR: You've expressed your wishes very clearly, Marija, and I commend you for being so thoughtful and resolute. It's perfectly logical to prioritize comfort, and we will certainly honor that preference. Let's move on to the next statement: “I want to be resuscitated if my heart or breathing stops.” Do you agree, disagree, or are you unsure?
PATIENT: No. I… disagree. Resuscitated? Absolutely not. If my time has come… then it has come. I do not wish to be… brought back, only to suffer. What is the point of… a temporary reprieve, only to face further pain and distress? No, absolutely not. I want peace. A natural… ending. Is that… sufficient? This is… difficult, you know. Thinking about… the end. It's… unsettling. I feel rather… faint.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Marija. It is difficult, and it's perfectly normal to feel unsettled. Take a deep breath. Perhaps we should pause for a moment. Would you like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Yes… water would be lovely, Doctor. Thank you. This is… rather overwhelming. All this… thinking about the end. It’s… exhausting. Perhaps we should pause. Yes, a pause would be… appreciated. My husband… he worries, you know. He'll want to know… everything. But I… I need a moment. Just a moment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Absolutely. Take all the time you need. There's no rush. I’ll have the nurse bring you some water, and we can take a break for a few minutes. We can continue this conversation when you feel ready. Perhaps we can even involve Hamid if you’d like. Just focus on breathing for now. You’re doing very well.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are… very kind. Hamid… yes, he will want to be here. He worries, you see. He’ll want to… ask questions. He’ll want to… understand everything. Perhaps… involving him is best. Yes, that is… best. Just a moment… to… breathe. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Marija. There’s absolutely no need to rush. I'll be right here when you're ready to continue. Just focus on feeling comfortable. We can adjust the pace to whatever feels best for you. I'll let you have a few moments of quiet.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You… you are very patient. I… I appreciate that. Perhaps… when Hamid arrives… we can continue. Yes. That would be… best. Just… a moment to… gather my thoughts. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I'll let you and Hamid have some time. I'll be just outside if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to ask. Take your time, and I'll be happy to continue this conversation when you're both ready. You've already made a great deal of progress, and I commend you for being so courageous. Just focus on feeling comfortable for now. I'll be right here.
