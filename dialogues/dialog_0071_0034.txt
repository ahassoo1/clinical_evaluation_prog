DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi! Um... well, I just moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I guess? It's for... Medicare, I think my husband said. He does most of that stuff. I don’t really remember much about it all.
DOCTOR: Right, getting established. That's perfectly alright. A lot of folks are doing that these days. And yes, Medicare is fine. It's good to have things sorted. So, besides getting things set up with Medicare, is there anything currently bothering you?
PATIENT: Um... not really? I mean, nothing big. I get tired sometimes, but I work a lot with machines… so that’s probably it? It’s a pretty physical job, being a mechanic. I don’t know if that counts as bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness… and you work as a mechanic, physically demanding work. That absolutely counts as something to discuss. It’s important to rule things out, even if it seems likely to be work-related. Just to get a better picture, Emileigh, how long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh… gee. That’s a hard one. A while, I think? Maybe… since we moved? But we just got here, like, a month ago? It's all kind of blurry, honestly. I’m not good with dates. It’s just… always been a little tired, I guess.
DOCTOR: A month, or a general feeling of tiredness for a while now… alright. And would you say it interferes with your work, or daily activities?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. Like, at the end of the day I just… want to sit. A lot. And I forget things easier now, too. Not big things, just… where I put my tools, or what I was doing. My husband gets a little annoyed with me. He says I used to be better at remembering.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, forgetfulness… interfering with work and daily life… It's good you're telling me this. Now, Emileigh, has anything changed recently, besides the move?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Let me think… We sold a lot of stuff before we moved, to get rid of things. And… oh! I started taking a new vitamin, I think? My aunt told me it was good for energy. It was… orange, maybe? I don't really pay attention to those things. My husband gets them for me.
DOCTOR: Sold belongings, new vitamin… orange vitamin, husband gets it for you… Alright. Do you happen to know the name of that vitamin?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. Sorry. I just take it with breakfast. It’s in a little bottle… I think it had pictures of fruit on it? I'm really not good with remembering names or details. My husband would know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emileigh. Don't worry about it. It's helpful just knowing you've started a new supplement. Now, let's switch gears for a moment. Have you been having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind? I don’t know what counts as a symptom. I haven't been sick, if that's what you mean. Just tired, and… forgetful. Sometimes my hands feel a little shaky when I’m working, but that could just be the machines. They vibrate a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, forgetfulness, shaky hands… potentially related to the machinery. Hmm. Now, Emileigh, when you say "shaky hands," is it all the time, or only when you're using the machines?
PATIENT: Only when I'm working. Like, when I'm using the wrench or the drill. It doesn't happen when I’m eating or… just sitting. It just feels a little hard to hold things steady sometimes. It's not bad, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, shaky hands specifically with machinery. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I don't know. I haven't really been weighing myself. My husband says I look fine. I haven't been eating much different, I guess. Just normal food. Maybe a little more takeout since we moved, everything’s so new and… busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight changes reported. Let's talk about your medical history, Emileigh. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much. Just check-ups when I was a kid, I think. My husband says I’m usually pretty healthy. I don’t remember anything being… wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. Not even to get my tonsils out or anything. I’m… pretty lucky, I guess. Everything always worked okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, Emileigh, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… gee. That’s a hard one. My mom… she had something with her heart, I think? But she lived a long life. And my dad… he got old and… well, you know. I don’t really know what they had, to be honest. No one ever really talked about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart condition in mother, general aging in father… Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just that vitamin I told you about. And sometimes I take something for a headache, if I need it. Just over-the-counter stuff. Like… ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. And I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. My husband always checks, though, before I take anything new.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up and I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. Then I'll take a look at your hands and do a quick neurological check. Take a few deep breaths for me, please… Okay… heart rate is slightly elevated, but that could be from the conversation. Lungs are clear… no wheezing or crackles. Now, let me just see your hands… Any pain or stiffness in your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: No, not really. They just feel a little tired sometimes, like everything else. And a little shaky when I'm using the machines, but it's not painful. I'm used to working with my hands, so I guess they're just… worn out. They don’t hurt, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tenderness or swelling… good range of motion. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal… a little diminished, but that’s not necessarily concerning… it could be normal variation. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, you’re experiencing fatigue, forgetfulness, and shakiness in your hands when using machinery. There are a few things that could be causing this, and I want to rule out some possibilities. We should run some blood tests. A complete blood count to check for anemia, thyroid function tests to rule out thyroid issues, and a Vitamin D level, since fatigue can be a symptom of deficiency. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests are okay. I just want to feel better, you know? It's just… tiring all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get those tests ordered right away. I’m also going to write you a referral to a neurologist, just as a precaution. The shakiness in your hands warrants further investigation, even if it’s likely related to your work. I’ll have the lab order and referral sent to you electronically, and also printed out for you. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity if you can. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. You've explained everything really well. My husband will probably have questions, though. He worries a lot. Is it okay if he calls later if he thinks of something?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. He's more than welcome to call the office. We’re happy to answer any questions he has. Here are the printed orders and the referral information. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the lab results, to discuss them in detail. Alright, Emileigh. Get some rest, and we'll see you soon. If anything changes significantly before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Dr. Galena. Thank you for everything. .
