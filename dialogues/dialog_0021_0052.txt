DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Benic, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too. It's this… well, it’s a bit of a sickly feeling in the mornings, mostly. Nausea, I suppose you’d call it. Been happenin’ for a couple o’ weeks now. I was told to come see someone about it, given… well, given my heart isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Sickly feeling,” alright. And you said a couple of weeks… is it only in the mornings?
PATIENT: Aye, mostly. It's usually the first thing I notice when I wake up. Sometimes it lingers a bit after I get up and have a cup of tea, but it usually doesn’t last all day. Though, I will say, last Tuesday I felt a bit queasy after lunch as well… but that was just the once. It's the mornings that are the real bother. I try to eat a biscuit or two before gettin' out of bed, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned your heart isn’t what it used to be… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, aye. It's… well, it’s a long story. Had a bad bout o' the flu years ago, and it weakened it something fierce. Been seein' a specialist in Glasgow for it, on and off. They said somethin' about… heart failure, I think? It's not gettin' worse quickly, thankfully, but it means I tire easily and I’ve gotta be careful. They keep a close eye on the fluid build-up, mostly. They told me to watch out for swelling in my ankles and shortness of breath, and to let them know if things changed.
DOCTOR: “Heart failure,” right. And you’re currently seeing someone about that?
PATIENT: Aye, Dr. MacLeod. Good man, but it’s a fair trek to Glasgow, mind you. I try to go when I need to, but it's not easy. He’s the one who told me to come in about this nausea. Said it could be a sign somethin’ was up with the medication, or… or somethin’ else related to the heart. Honestly, I'm just tryin’ to keep on top of things. I like bein' independent, ye ken? It's just… this mornin’ sickness is a bit more than I can handle on my own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medications. What exactly are you taking right now?
PATIENT: Right, let me think… I have a wee pillbox, thankfully. Let's see… there's Ramipril, 5 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And Bisoprolol, 2.5 milligrams, also once a day, for the heart rate. Then there’s Furosemide, 40 milligrams, that’s a water tablet, Dr. MacLeod prescribed it to help with the fluid. I take that every mornin’, too. And… oh, sometimes I take Paracetamol for aches and pains, but that’s just as needed, not regularly. I try to stick to the schedule as best I can, but sometimes I forget… although I’m usually pretty good at rememberin’ now.
DOCTOR: Ramipril, Bisoprolol, and Furosemide… alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've had a few scrapes and bumps over the years and taken plenty of things at the doctor's, and never had a reaction. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don’t think that’s relevant, is it? I haven't taken that in decades. I've no known allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your abdomen. Just lie back there, please. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Aye, right. Sounds sensible. Easy does it… been a bit creaky lately. Go ahead when you're ready. I'll try and stay as still as I can.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is a bit elevated, around 88, but not alarmingly so given your history. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. No signs of fluid retention that I can detect clinically at this moment. Let's check your blood pressure and ankles. Blood pressure is 140/90. Ankles show very mild pitting edema, barely noticeable. It’s likely within the normal range for your condition.
PATIENT: Aye, that's good to hear about the lungs. The ankles do swell a bit at the end of the day sometimes, but I usually put me feet up and it goes down. 140/90… that’s not too bad, is it? Dr. MacLeod always says to keep an eye on it, but it fluctuates. So, what does all this mean? Is it somethin' serious, or just a wee bit of a blip?
DOCTOR: “A wee bit of a blip” isn't really how I’d describe it, but it’s not immediately alarming. Given your heart history, the nausea could be related to the medication, or it could be a sign that something is changing with your heart function. The mild edema is consistent with your existing condition, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a BNP level – that’s a marker for heart failure. We’ll also need an ECG to look for any changes in your heart rhythm. It’s standard procedure, really.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough. Kidney function, electrolytes, and… BNP? Right. I suppose if it helps to rule things out, it's worth doin'. I trust your judgement, doctor. An ECG, too… haven't had one of them in a while. When will I get the results? And will I need to come back again? I'm tryin’ to arrange a trip to visit me granddaughter in Edinburgh next month, so I'm hopin' it's not too complicated.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take a couple of days, maybe three. I’ll have the receptionist contact you when they’re back. And yes, you will need to come back in to discuss the results and decide on a plan. It's unlikely to interfere with your trip, but depending on what we find, you may need to adjust your medication or have further testing. I'm also going to recommend a low-sodium diet and continue to monitor your fluid intake. It's basic, but important. And please, write down any changes you experience - new symptoms, increased swelling, shortness of breath – everything. It’ll make things a lot easier when we review the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Aye, low sodium, I can manage that. Bit of a struggle, mind you, I do enjoy a bit o’ salted caramel, but I can cut back. And I will write things down, I promise. Haven't felt that bad yet, but I understand the importance o' keepin’ track. Hmm… one question, if you don’t mind. This BNP level… is that a bad thing if it's high? I'm not one for fancy medical terms, so if you could explain it in plain English, I'd be much obliged. And is there anything I should be lookin’ out for right now before the results come back? Any red flags, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Alright. A BNP level is basically a measure of how stretched and strained your heart is. The higher the level, the more your heart is working to pump blood. It doesn't automatically mean something is wrong, but it's an indicator we need to pay attention to. And yes, there are things to look out for. Any significant increase in shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles or legs that doesn't improve with elevation, sudden weight gain – more than a couple of pounds in a day – and, of course, any chest pain. If you experience any of those symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. Don't wait for me to call you back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand. Shortness of breath, worsen' ankles, sudden weight gain, and chest pain… head straight to the emergency room. Got it. It's good to know what to look out for, even if it's a bit worryin' to hear. Right. Well, thank you, doctor. You've been very… thorough. I'll get the blood test done and keep a close eye on things. Hopefully, it's just a wee blip, as I said. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. The receptionist will give you the lab order and instructions. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. And please, try to reduce your stress levels. That’s all for today. Take care, Mr. Benic.
PATIENT: Aye, I will do me best. Thank you again. Goodbye to you too, doctor. And thank you for your time.
