DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I am using the machine they gave me for the sleep apnea. It just…doesn’t seem to be doing the trick, you know? I feel tired all the time, even after a full night with it on. It’s making things difficult, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Daytime sleepiness despite using the CPAP machine…right. And how long has this been going on with the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been…about three months, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. They fitted me for it in late April, I believe. At first, it seemed to help, a bit. But the last month or so…it’s like it’s just not enough. I still find myself nodding off in the afternoon, and it’s getting harder to concentrate. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest. I used to be so sharp!
DOCTOR: Three months…Well, sometimes it takes a little while to adjust to the machine, you know. It's not always an immediate fix. But if it hasn’t improved, or has gotten worse as you say… we need to look at a few things. Have you been consistent with using it every night?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, very consistent. Unless I’m traveling, which hasn’t been much lately, I use it every single night. I’ve gotten used to it, thankfully. It's not comfortable, mind you, but I do use it. I make sure the mask is sealed properly too, every time. My wife…well, my ex-wife, she used to check on me, at first, to make sure I wasn’t taking it off in my sleep. She was always a worrier, that one. But yes, I’m using it as I was instructed. Honestly, I think something else might be going on.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good that you're diligent about the machine. It eliminates one possibility. But “something else” is rather vague, Mr. Paske. Let's start with the basics. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other symptoms… Well, my legs…they sometimes feel a bit restless at night. Not every night, but often enough to be annoying. And I’ve been feeling a bit more…forgetful, I suppose, although I always had a good memory, you know. It’s not like I can’t remember things completely, just…small details, names sometimes. And I’ve been a little more irritable, I think. My grandson mentioned it, actually. He said I’ve been “grumpy,” which wasn't very polite, but…he might have a point. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Restless legs, some forgetfulness, irritability… Okay. Those could be related, or they could be separate issues. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My appetite…no, I don't think so. I’m still eating pretty much the same as always, maybe a little less, but that's just because I don't get as hungry when I'm tired, I think. As for weight…well, I think I've lost a couple of pounds, maybe. Nothing dramatic, just enough that my pants feel a little looser. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I try not to focus on that too much. I'm mostly worried about feeling this tired all the time. It’s affecting my work, you know. I’m a professor, still, and it’s hard to lecture when you can barely keep your eyes open.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we need to rule out a few things. We'll start with some bloodwork. It’s fairly routine, but it can help us identify potential deficiencies or underlying conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. Also, I want to review your CPAP data. Do you remember how to access that information?
PATIENT: Bloodwork sounds sensible, Doctor. Yes, that makes sense. As for the CPAP data… Honestly, no. They showed me how when they first fitted me for the machine, but I’ve forgotten everything. It involved a computer, I think, and some sort of USB cable? But I haven’t touched it since. My grandson, David, he's good with computers, maybe he could help? He’s a whiz with all that technology. But I wouldn't want to bother him if it’s something you could do here, though.
DOCTOR: It’s fine, we can certainly access the data here. It's just…it's helpful to see if you're getting adequate airflow and if there are any leaks in the mask. It gives us a more complete picture. Okay, let's start with a physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Then we’ll get the bloodwork ordered. If you could just sit up here for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Sounds good. The physical exam is fine. I haven't had one in a while, to be honest. I suppose it's good to get things checked out properly. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m not very good with surprises, you know. A little warning is always appreciated.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Paske. I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a nice, deep breath in…and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, I'm just checking your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Say "Ahhh..."
PATIENT: Ahhh… Is everything alright, Doctor? I always get a bit nervous when someone looks down my throat. It feels…invasive, somehow. I used to have terrible tonsils as a child, so I'm always worried they’ll find something wrong. But I suppose it’s necessary, if it helps to figure out what’s going on. Everything feels a little dry, actually. I haven’t been drinking as much water as I should, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Throat is a little dry, as you mentioned, but no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Tonsils are normal in size, no exudate. Your throat looks fine, Mr. Paske. Now, I'm going to check your ears. Ears are clear bilaterally. No signs of fluid or infection. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. We'll send off the bloodwork now and get those results back to you as soon as possible. While we're waiting, it would be helpful if you kept a sleep diary – note when you go to bed, when you wake up, and how rested you feel in the morning. It can give us a better understanding of your sleep patterns.
PATIENT: A sleep diary, you say? That sounds…manageable, I suppose. A bit of writing, that won’t be too difficult. I used to keep a journal when I was younger, although it was mostly about poetry and unrequited love. But a sleep diary…yes, I can do that. And you'll let me know as soon as the bloodwork results come back? It's just…this tiredness is really getting me down. It’s hard to concentrate at work, and I don’t have the energy to do the things I enjoy. It feels like my life is just…passing me by. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll let you know as soon as the results are back, Mr. Paske. We'll review everything together then and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, the sleep diary will be helpful. Try to be as detailed as possible. Now, I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Not at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just…thank you again for your time and attention. It’s good to know that someone is taking this seriously. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. And try to remember to drink more water. And keep that sleep diary… It feels like a lot to keep track of, but I’ll do my best. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
