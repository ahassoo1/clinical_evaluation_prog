DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this stomach of mine… been acting up. I just… don’t feel right, you know? I get sick to my stomach pretty easily now, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It’s been going on for a little while, I reckon. Hard to say exactly how long… time just slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. "Stomach acting up," and feeling full quickly. And you say this has been going on for "a little while." Can you try to be more specific about when it started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific. That’s… tricky. I suppose… after my husband passed. No, not right after, but sometime after that. Maybe… six months or so ago? It’s hard to remember things clearly. Everything seems to blend together now. I was always good with dates when he was alive, but… well. It’s just not the same. Did that make sense? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kelder. These things happen. Six months ago, after your husband’s passing… that gives us a timeframe. And you mentioned feeling sick to your stomach. Is that nausea, or are you actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly just sick to my stomach. Not… a lot of actual throwing up, thankfully. Just… queasy. And a little weak sometimes after, even if I don’t throw up. It's a hollow feeling, more than anything. Like there's no room for anything, even if I haven't eaten much. Does that… explain it better? I’m trying, Doctor. Really I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… somewhat helpful. “Queasy” and “hollow feeling.” Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I do get tired easily, more than usual. And… sometimes my appetite is just gone. Not always, but often. It's like I don't even want to eat. And I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't actually weighed myself recently. I’m not much for fussing with scales, you see. Is that important? I'm sorry if I'm just… listing things at random. It’s hard to know what matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tired easily, decreased appetite, and unintentional weight loss. It is important, Ms. Kelder. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh my… bowel habits? Well… I haven’t been as regular as I used to be. More…constipated, I suppose. Though sometimes it’s… the other way, if you know what I mean. It’s been a bit unpredictable, to be honest. I haven't really paid it much attention until you asked. It's just… one of those things, I guess. Old age, maybe? I'm truly sorry for being so vague. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Irregular bowel habits… Ms. Kelder, I’m going to need to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a long list, I'm afraid. Let's see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in the… seventies, I believe. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they put a stent in and it’s been alright ever since. And… oh, yes. They told me I had cancer a while back. Breast cancer. It was… a long time ago. They did everything they could, and I thought it was all over with. That's why I'm surprised this is happening now. I just… assumed it was something else.
DOCTOR: A history of breast cancer… and a stent. That is pertinent information. And you said “they did everything they could.” Do you recall the specific type of cancer, or the treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics… That was so long ago, Doctor. They did surgery, of course. And… radiation, I think. Maybe chemotherapy? It was all a blur. I remember being very sick, and tired, and… scared. My husband was wonderful, though. He took care of everything. I just… I don't recall the type of cancer. Invasive something, maybe? It’s been so long, and I haven’t had to think about it until now. I'm sorry. I truly am. My mind just doesn’t work like it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to access your records to confirm the details of your cancer treatment. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a few. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And… something for my arthritis, keeps my hands from aching too badly. And a baby aspirin, the doctor told me to take it for my heart. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my sleep, when I can't get to rest. I think that’s all. It all just gets mixed up, you know? I keep them in a little box, but I forget which one is which sometimes. I usually just take what feels right. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, it is not advisable to take medication based on what "feels right." That can be dangerous. I need a complete list of your medications, including dosages. And we need to review your allergies, if any. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh my… I didn't realize it was so important. I just…try to get by. Allergies… let me think. I don't think so. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I know. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat strawberries, but that's all. As for the medications… Here, let me see if I can sort it out. This is… a bit of a mess. The blood pressure pill is the little blue one, I think. And the arthritis one is…yellow, maybe? Oh, and the aspirin… that’s the white one. And the sleep pill… it's small and round, I think it's pink. I apologize. I really do. This is all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll sort this out. Now, I’m going to perform a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I’m not very steady on my feet these days, Doctor. My balance isn't what it used to be. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. And… try not to poke too hard, please. My stomach's been rather tender lately.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there is mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Right there… that’s where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, exactly… more of a dull ache. It’s been getting worse lately, especially after I eat. It feels… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. And sometimes… it feels like something’s pressing on my chest. It’s hard to explain. It just feels… uncomfortable. And I get a little bit breathless sometimes, too. Not all the time, but… when it happens, it’s scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. Given your history of breast cancer, weight loss, and abdominal tenderness, we need to rule out recurrence or metastasis. We'll also need to investigate the possibility of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. I'm going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and chest. This will help us get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh my… a CT scan? Is that… is that dangerous? I’ve heard those things have radiation. And blood work… I don’t like needles. Is there… is there anything else we can do? I just… I don’t want to go through all that if it’s not necessary. It's all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. And I'm afraid of what you might find.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. The radiation exposure from a CT scan is minimal, and the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. As for the blood work, it’s a simple procedure, and we'll make it as comfortable as possible. We need to rule out serious conditions, and these tests are the best way to do that. If it turns out to be something minor, then we'll address it accordingly. But we need to have a clear understanding of what's going on before we can determine the appropriate course of treatment. I'll also schedule a referral to a gastroenterologist. They specialize in digestive disorders and can provide further evaluation and management. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… a gastroenterologist. That sounds… complicated. And the tests… I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. But I get nervous easily, Doctor. Very nervous. And I don’t have anyone to take me to the appointments. My husband… he always took care of everything. Could someone… could someone from the office help me schedule them? And maybe… go with me? I’m afraid of being alone. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. I understand your anxiety, and we will do everything we can to make this process as smooth as possible. My office staff can certainly assist you with scheduling the appointments, and we can arrange for a medical escort to accompany you if you wish. I'll write a referral for Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist in town. She's very good and has a gentle demeanor. As for the CT scan, we’ll schedule it at the imaging center across the street. They have experienced technicians and a comfortable environment. I’ll also prescribe you a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you manage your nervousness before the tests. Here’s the referral information and the medication prescription. Please call my office tomorrow to schedule the appointments. We’ll take care of everything, Ms. Kelder. Don’t worry. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s very kind of you. A medical escort… that would be wonderful. And the anti-anxiety medication… I think I could use that. I don't think I have any other questions right now. I just… I need to process everything. It’s just been a long time since I had to worry about things like this. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I truly appreciate it. I think… I think I should go now. It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. And remember, we'll take care of everything. Have a good day, and please, try not to worry too much. .
