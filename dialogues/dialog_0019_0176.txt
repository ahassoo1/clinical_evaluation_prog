DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. It's… really getting annoying, to be honest. More than 48 hours now, I think.
DOCTOR: Oh, goodness, hiccups that last that long are incredibly frustrating. More than 48 hours, you say… alright. And is there anything in particular that seemed to bring them on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not that I can recall, really. I had a pretty normal day, I think. Lunch with a friend, a bit of shopping… nothing out of the ordinary. I had a fizzy drink with lunch, maybe? But I have those sometimes and it doesn’t usually cause this. I honestly can’t pinpoint anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious trigger. That’s alright, sometimes they just…start. And are you experiencing anything else along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Like what, Doctor? Just the hiccups, really. No pain, no heartburn… nothing else feels off. I’m a little tired from…well, you know, hiccuping all the time! But not sick, not feverish, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No other symptoms… that’s helpful. And just to get a better picture, have you noticed if anything makes them worse, or even…better?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… when I drink water really fast, it seems to make them worse for a little bit. Like, it’ll trigger a whole bunch right after. But… nothing really makes them better, if I’m being honest. I tried holding my breath, like everyone says, but that didn’t do much. I’ve been trying all sorts of things people told me, really.
DOCTOR: Holding your breath is a classic, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It is! Everyone seems to have a ‘cure’ they swear by. My friend said to eat a spoonful of sugar, but I didn't want to try that. I'm trying to watch my weight, you see. But it hasn’t gone away, so I guess none of it’s working. It’s just… persistent. Really persistent.
DOCTOR: Persistent is a good word for it. Alright, Ivette. I'd like to do a quick examination, just to rule out anything obvious. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's fine. Examination table, you say? No problem at all. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just lie flat on your back, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just feel your abdomen. Nothing to worry about, just a standard check. And I may want to take your temperature and blood pressure as well.
PATIENT: Alright. Temperature and blood pressure sounds good. I haven't had those checked in a while, actually. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. Go ahead when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, if you can. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs sound clear as well. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful.
PATIENT: Okay. No pain there, Doctor. Feels… normal, I suppose. A little sensitive maybe, but I think that’s just… well, you know, from all the hiccuping! It’s been quite a workout for my diaphragm, I imagine.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point – a workout for the diaphragm, absolutely. No significant tenderness, though. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Blood pressure is 135/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, given that these hiccups have been going on for over 48 hours, and we haven’t found an obvious cause… and your blood pressure is a little high… it's worth considering a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay. Possibilities? What kind of possibilities? Should I be worried? I just want these hiccups to stop, but I don’t want something serious going on.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily worried, but it’s good to be thorough. Prolonged hiccups can sometimes be a symptom of something else. It could be something simple like irritation of the diaphragm, or it could be related to your blood pressure. It's also possible it's something affecting the nerves that control the diaphragm. We'll start with some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Also, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to check your lungs and diaphragm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray… Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes, definitely. Will the blood work tell me anything about the hiccups themselves? Or just… other things? And the X-ray… will it show if my diaphragm is irritated?
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health, and can help rule out things like electrolyte imbalances or inflammation that might be contributing to the hiccups. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your diaphragm and lungs, to see if there are any obvious abnormalities. It can't necessarily tell us why it's irritated, but it can help us identify if there is irritation. Now, I know that this is probably a little unnerving, but I want to be cautious and get to the bottom of this. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to prescribe a medication called Baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help to calm the diaphragm and stop the hiccups. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Baclofen, a muscle relaxant… I’ve never taken anything like that before. What are the side effects? I don’t want something that will make me feel… too sleepy, or anything like that. I have things to do, you know? And… how long would I have to take it for?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Common side effects of Baclofen can include drowsiness, dizziness, and weakness. It's important not to drive or operate machinery if you experience these effects. It can also cause nausea, constipation, or trouble sleeping. We'll start with a low dose, and see how you tolerate it. We can always adjust it if needed. As for how long, we'll start with a one-week course. If the hiccups haven't stopped after that, we can discuss extending the treatment or exploring other options. We’ll monitor you closely. Now, given your insurance situation, I can work with the clinic to see if we can find a more affordable option for the X-ray and the medication. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor, thank you. I really appreciate that. Not being insured makes things… difficult. So, one week of Baclofen… and the blood work and X-ray. And you’ll let me know the results as soon as they’re in? I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's just… so exhausting. I'm just grateful you’re taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. It is exhausting, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. I’ll get the order for the blood work and X-ray sent over to the lab and radiology department. The lab technician will draw some blood from your arm, and you’ll schedule an appointment for the X-ray. Once the results are in, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll write up this prescription for the Baclofen, and make a note for my nurse to contact you about the cost. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to listen. And thank you for looking into the cost of things – that’s a big help. I suppose I should go and schedule those tests, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be great. The receptionist at the front desk can help you schedule those tests. And please, don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. I'll see you soon, Ivette. I hope you feel better soon.
