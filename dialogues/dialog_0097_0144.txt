DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It is lovely to meet you too. Dr. Georgiou, you said? Hmm. Well, honestly, I don’t really need anything. My daughter, bless her heart, she just insisted I come. Said I should “get checked out.” Always fussing. Just curious, I suppose. A woman can’t just… exist anymore without someone poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: That’s very sweet of her, and it's wonderful that she’s so attentive to your health. It is a good idea to have regular check-ups, even if you're feeling perfectly fine. We can catch things early, you know?
PATIENT: Catch things… yes, yes. I suppose. Honestly, I've been a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, decades. I've seen things. Probably know more than most doctors about what goes on inside people. Not that I’m saying you’re not a good doctor, dear. Just… seen a lot. Still, my daughter… she worries.
DOCTOR: That’s incredibly valuable experience, Lilly. Being a surgical tech for decades… you've got a unique perspective, and I completely understand where you’re coming from. It’s actually quite reassuring to know you’re so informed. And daughters do worry – it’s their job! So, even though you're feeling well, let’s humor your daughter a bit, shall we?
PATIENT: Humor her, yes. That sounds sensible. Alright. Well… I’ve been a little… forgetful lately. Not terribly, you understand. Just… names. Faces. Where I put my glasses. Though, I do have them on right now. See? It’s… frustrating. More frustrating for others, I suspect. My son-in-law keeps giving me looks.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal as we get older, Lilly. Little memory lapses happen to everyone. But it’s good you’re mentioning it. We can definitely explore that a bit further, just to rule out anything else going on. Can you tell me a little more about this forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not terrible. I remember… the important things. How to set up a sterile field, for one. And… well, I remember my husband. Mostly. It's just… small things. Like, I went to the grocery store yesterday and… I can’t recall what I went to buy. My daughter said I came home with three different kinds of olives. I don't even like olives! It's just… a bit embarrassing, really. And annoying.
DOCTOR: That does sound a bit more than just typical age-related forgetfulness, especially the olives! It’s good you’re aware of it, and it’s perfectly okay to feel embarrassed or annoyed. We can explore this a bit further. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate, or have you had any difficulty with problem-solving or making decisions?
PATIENT: Concentrate… hmm. Well, I do find myself… re-reading things. A lot. Used to be able to scan a chart and know everything right away. Now, I have to go back and… back and… Oh dear, what was I saying? It’s like my brain is… slow. And decisions… well, I’ve always been decisive. Now, I second-guess everything. Even what to have for breakfast. It’s… bothersome. Though, to be fair, breakfast is a difficult decision.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, which is definitely something we want to address. Would you mind if I just did a quick little test, a few simple questions, to get a better sense of things?
PATIENT: A test? Oh dear. I hate tests. Always did. Though, I suppose if my daughter would stop fretting… alright. Fine. But don't expect miracles. My brain isn’t what it used to be, you know. And please, no math. I never was good at math.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no math, I promise! This is just a very simple assessment, nothing to worry about. It’ll just help me get a clearer picture of things. It won't be graded, and it's okay if you don't remember everything perfectly. Okay, first question… what is today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The date… Let me think. It’s… August. Definitely August. Um… Is it the 1st? No, that doesn't seem right. My granddaughter's birthday is next week… so it must be… the 2nd? August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so. It feels right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s absolutely correct! August 2nd, 2025. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, that's easy. I’ve lived here my whole life. It’s… hmm. It’s… a small town. Very quiet. Lots of farms. Um… is it… Millbrook? No, that's not it. Oh dear, this is embarrassing. It's… on the tip of my tongue! It’s… rural. That’s all I can remember. A very rural town.
DOCTOR: That’s okay, Lilly. It's perfectly alright to take your time. We're in Havenwood. You live in Havenwood.
PATIENT: Havenwood! Oh, yes. Of course. Havenwood. Right. Silly me. I do live in Havenwood. I just… it slipped my mind for a moment. It's been a long day, you know? And my daughter… she’s been fussing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilly. It happens. Let's move on. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh, three words? Alright. Let’s hear them. Don’t make them too difficult, dear. My brain is a bit… foggy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The words are: table, penny, and cloud. Please try to remember them. I'll ask you to repeat them back to me later. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Table, penny, cloud… alright. Got it. Though, I’m not sure I’ll remember them. Now, medical history… hmm. My husband, bless his soul, he had a bit of trouble with his heart. And… I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… unpleasant. High blood pressure, the doctor mentioned something about that once, but I don’t really pay attention to those things. I take my pills, that’s what’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of high blood pressure. And you take your medications as prescribed. That’s good to hear. Do you know what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those little pills… Let me see. There’s… a white one. And a blue one. And a small pink one. I think one is for my blood pressure, and another one… helps me sleep? My daughter keeps track of all of them. I just take what she gives me. She's very organized, that one.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful. It sounds like your daughter is a great help. We’ll need to get a complete list of your medications to make sure everything is correct and safe. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky, that way. I used to eat everything in sight when I was younger. Though, I don’t eat much anymore. Lost my appetite, I suppose. My daughter says I should eat more olives. Can you imagine? Olives!
DOCTOR: Olives, yes. It seems to be a recurring theme. Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a sad topic, really. My mother, bless her heart, she had… problems with her memory, towards the end. She didn't recognize anyone. It was awful. And my father… he died of a heart attack. Very sudden. My husband’s side of the family… they had a bit of everything, really. Cancer, mostly. It’s… not a good history, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilly. That’s important information to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’ve always been a very proper woman. My husband, he used to have a little glass of wine with dinner, but that was it. I don’t touch a drop. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’ve seen enough of that in the operating room, thank you very much. Gives me the shivers just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And how active are you, Lilly?
PATIENT: Oh, not very, dear. Not anymore. Used to be a very active gardener, but my knees… they aren't what they used to be. Now I mostly sit. Watch television. Read. My daughter tries to get me to walk, but I get tired easily. And… well, it's lonely, sometimes. My son visits when he can, but he lives far away. Mostly it's just me and the television.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's natural to feel lonely sometimes. Do you ever feel sad or anxious, or have trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes, dear. Sometimes I just… cry. For no reason. My daughter says it’s the grief, still. It's been years since my husband passed, but… I miss him terribly. And yes, I have trouble sleeping. I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about things. Old things. Sad things. And I worry. I worry about my daughter. And my son. And… well, everything. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot, Lilly. It’s completely understandable to feel that way. It takes courage to share these things, and I want you to know I’m here to listen. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, just to get a better understanding of how you're feeling. It's alright if you don't want to answer anything. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. If you think it will help. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. I know you have other patients, and I’m just an old woman with a few… problems. But yes, ask away. I suppose it can't hurt.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Lilly. And it’s important that we address everything that’s going on. Okay, over the last two weeks, have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Two weeks… Let me think. Well, most days I just feel… tired. And a little sad, I suppose. Not terribly. Just… a quiet sadness. It’s always there, in the background. Like a… a dull ache. Hopeless? No, not really. I still have my daughter, you see. And my son. But yes, I suppose I’ve been feeling… down. Most days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilly. And have you lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I used to love gardening, like I said. And reading. But now… it just doesn’t seem to bring me joy anymore. I sit and read, but my mind wanders. I forget what I’ve read. And the garden… well, it’s just overgrown. My daughter tries to help, but she doesn’t have the time. It’s… sad, really. Everything just feels… empty.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're going through a lot. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. I don't eat much anymore. Food just doesn't taste the same. And I've lost weight, my daughter keeps telling me. She brings me soup, and little sandwiches, but I just pick at them. I used to have a good appetite, you know. But now… it's just not there. I don't even bother with dessert anymore. Olives are more appealing, strangely enough. Though, that's probably not saying much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilly. Alright, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few other basic things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my lifetime, I suppose. Just… try to be gentle, alright? My skin is a little thin these days. And please, no surprises. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. And no surprises, I promise. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Okay, taking a deep breath for me... and exhale... Good. Your heart sounds regular, but your breathing sounds a little quiet in the lower parts of your lungs. Nothing too concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A little hammer, you say? Sounds… intimidating. Well, go ahead. Just be quick about it, alright? My knees aren't what they used to be. And I don't like being tapped. It reminds me of the operating room.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few taps here… and here… Good. Your reflexes are a little quiet, but they’re the same on both sides, which is good. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is a little high today, but it can fluctuate. And your pulse is good and steady. One last thing, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Alright, everything sounds normal in your abdomen. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, that wasn't too bad, I suppose. A little tapping, a little listening… It’s all a bit much, really. But I suppose it's necessary. So, what did you find? Am I terribly ill? Don't tell me it's something serious, alright? I don't want to worry my daughter.
DOCTOR: You're not terribly ill, Lilly. Everything looked good overall, but we did find a few things we want to address. Your breathing sounds a little quiet in the lower parts of your lungs, and your reflexes are a little quiet, which can sometimes happen as we get older. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that can fluctuate. However, based on the exam and what you’ve told me about your memory and mood, I’m concerned about possible early signs of cognitive decline. It's important to investigate this further. It doesn't necessarily mean it's dementia, but we need to rule out other causes and get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Cognitive… what now? Decline? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. You mean… my brain is shrinking? Like an old prune? Is that what you're saying? And I’m going to forget everything? My husband's name? My daughter's name? Oh, this is terrible. Absolutely terrible. I knew I shouldn’t have come. I just wanted to humor my daughter, and now… now I’m going to lose my mind? Is that it?
DOCTOR: Lilly, please don't panic. It's very natural to be frightened when you hear something like this, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to lose your mind. Cognitive decline is a broad term, and there are many different causes. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, a side effect of medication, or just normal age-related changes. It could also be something more serious, but we won't know until we do some further testing. It’s important to remember that we’re just gathering information at this point. I want to run some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other possible causes. I also want you to do a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a specialist. This assessment will help us get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you the support you need. You’re not alone in this, and we’ll face this together. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests… Oh dear. Well, I suppose if you think it's necessary. But I don’t want to be poked and prodded too much. And I don’t want to see a specialist if they’re going to be… condescending. I've met doctors before who talk down to me like I’m a child. And what about my daughter? Should I tell her? She'll be beside herself. She worries enough as it is. Oh, this is all just… too much. I just wanted a little peace and quiet, and now… now I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Lilly. We will take things at your pace, and I will make sure you are comfortable every step of the way. The blood tests are routine and shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. And I will recommend a specialist who is known for their compassion and respectfulness. I will personally ensure they understand your concerns about being treated with respect. As for your daughter, that's up to you. It's often helpful to have support during times like these, but I respect your wishes if you'd prefer to handle it on your own. We can discuss the pros and cons together and decide what’s best for you. For now, let's focus on scheduling those blood tests. I'll also give you a referral to a cognitive specialist. Would you like me to call the lab and schedule the appointment for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just… get it over with. Call the lab, please. I don’t want to deal with it. And make sure it’s a comfortable lab. Not one of those cold, sterile places. And… and tell them I’m an elderly woman. They need to be gentle. And as for the specialist… just give me the name and number. I’ll… I’ll think about it. Maybe I’ll just ignore it. Maybe it will go away on its own. Oh dear… this is just… awful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. I’ve scheduled your blood test for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at Havenwood Family Lab – it's a very comfortable facility, and I’ve made a note in your chart to remind them to be gentle. Here’s the requisition form. And here's the referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist specializing in cognitive health. She's highly respected and very compassionate. Her number is 555-123-4567. I’ll also send a summary of our conversation to your primary care physician, so they are aware of everything that’s going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance… alright. I’ll… I’ll think about calling her. Maybe I’ll just ask my daughter. She always knows what to do. No… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… thank you, dear. For… for everything. Even though it’s all very frightening. Is there… is there anything I should do before the blood test? Anything I shouldn’t eat or drink? I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. And no, there’s nothing special you need to do before the blood test. Just try to get a good night's sleep, and you can eat and drink normally. Just let the phlebotomist know if you're prone to fainting or have any allergies. I’m going to write a note for your primary care physician about this and make sure they follow up with you as well. Here’s a printed copy of our conversation today, for your records. And remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns. Please don't hesitate to call. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, dear. You’ve been very kind. Even though… even though it’s all very upsetting. I suppose I should be going now. My daughter will be wondering where I am. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilly. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We'll get through this together. .
