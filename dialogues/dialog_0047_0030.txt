DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s…different. Not worse, exactly, just different than it usually is. I figured it was worth getting checked out.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s hard to explain. It's…sweeter, maybe? And a little bit…musty? I usually just smell…like, well, like sweat, you know? Normal sweat. But this is…noticeably different. I’ve been using the same deodorant for years, and I haven’t changed anything else, like my diet or soaps. It started, oh, I'd say about a week ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty constant, yes. I notice it every time I shower, and throughout the day, to be honest. I wouldn’t say it’s overpowering, but it’s definitely there. It makes me a little self-conscious, especially with the work I do. You get warm laying floors, you know? Lots of bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this change?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no night sweats, no weight loss… nothing else feels off. I mean, I’m 49, so things ache a little here and there, but that’s just getting older, I think! I sleep okay, eat pretty regularly… honestly, that's about it. Just this smell. It’s just… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Well, let's get a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue… I had penicillin as a kid, like everyone else, but no problems then or since. I don't have any environmental allergies either, like pollen or dust. Honestly, I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, like I said. Nothing regular, though. Maybe once or twice a week if I’ve had a particularly hard day at work. And the deodorant, of course, but that’s it. No ongoing prescriptions or anything like that. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my wrist once, but nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox… but nothing serious. I had a pretty normal pregnancy and delivery with my son, about 25 years ago now. He’s healthy as a horse! Other than that… no, I’d say I’ve been pretty lucky with my health, all things considered. No diabetes, no heart problems, no cancer… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had arthritis. His joints got really bad towards the end. My grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. And my brother… he’s healthy as a horse too, honestly. No major health issues on either side of the family, as far as I know. Everyone lived to be pretty old, at least in their 80s, but I don’t know specifics beyond that. They lived in Ethiopia, you see, and keeping track of those things was difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as a floor layer, so it’s pretty physical, as you can imagine. Lots of bending, lifting, kneeling… I’m on my feet all day. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables, lean protein… but sometimes it’s hard when you’re working long hours. I get enough sleep, usually around seven or eight hours a night. And I don't have any pets. It's pretty simple, really. Just work, eat, sleep, and try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Purtee, it’s unusual to have a change in body odor without other accompanying symptoms, but it's not unheard of. It could be a number of things. Before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just change into a gown, we'll start with a general examination, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your lymph nodes, and then a quick look at your skin. We’ll pay particular attention to areas where body odor is more prominent. It’s all fairly routine.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I’m a little nervous, I admit, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Please lie back. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Skin appears normal, no visible rashes or lesions. No obvious abnormalities noted.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn’t sound too bad, does it? So, what does that mean? Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It's good that we don't find anything overtly concerning on the physical exam, Ms. Purtee. However, a change in body odor can be associated with various underlying conditions, some more serious than others. While unlikely, we need to rule out a few things. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. These tests will give us a baseline and help rule out any infections, kidney problems, or metabolic disorders. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Anything to get to the bottom of it. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis… alright. When will I get the results? And will I need to come back in for another appointment? It's just...it's a little unsettling not knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are available. Depending on those results, we may need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in more detail. It’s possible this could be something benign, Ms. Purtee, like a change in your body chemistry or a slight alteration in your diet. But it’s important to rule out anything more serious. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or unusual fatigue, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for running the tests. I appreciate you not dismissing it as just…me being silly. And I will definitely call if anything else comes up. I just hope it's nothing too serious. I guess I'll just wait for the nurse to call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Purtee. We’ll get those results to you as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
