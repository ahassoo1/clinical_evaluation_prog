DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard. Not… not easy, you know? Takes me a while. I don’t… I don’t really know what else to say. It just… feels stuck, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination – it takes a while and sometimes feels like you can't empty your bladder completely. That can be very uncomfortable. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When did you first start noticing this problem?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start…? Hmm. A while now. Not… not recently. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? It’s hard to say. Things… they all kinda blend together after a bit, you know? I just… noticed it getting worse, I think. It wasn't always this bad.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – it can be hard to pinpoint exactly when things started. So, it's been gradually worsening over the past few months. And you said it’s gotten to the point where it's more difficult now than it was before. Can you tell me a little more about how it feels difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. How does it feel…? Well, it’s like… like trying to push something through a small hole. Not painful, exactly… more like… straining. I have to… push. And sometimes it just… dribbles. A little bit at a time. And then I have to go again soon after. It’s… bothersome. Very bothersome. I don’t want to be a bother, but… it's just not comfortable.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It's important to tell me these things so we can figure out what's going on and get you feeling more comfortable. So, you're experiencing straining to urinate, a slow stream, dribbling after you finish, and a frequent urge to go again soon after. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… pee? Oh… goodness. Let me think. Not… not that I've noticed. It looks… normal, I think. The usual color. Sometimes a little lighter, sometimes a little darker, depending on how much water I drink, I suppose. But… no blood, no funny smells. Nothing like that. I… I haven't really been looking at it, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. Most people don’t routinely examine their urine! Okay, so no noticeable changes in color, odor, or the presence of blood. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever. And chills… not that I recall. My bones aren’t achin’ or nothin’. And my tummy… no pain. Not really. Sometimes a little… uncomfortable after I eat, but that’s just my old age, I think. It’s not like a sharp pain, or anything like that. Just a little… full feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Just some fullness after eating, which you attribute to age. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… let me think. My doctor… well, I’ve had a few doctors over the years. I… I used to have high blood pressure, I think. But I took pills for it for a long time, and… I can't remember if I still do. My husband, he manages the pills now, mostly. He’s good with that sort of thing. I… I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. I get tired easily, but that’s just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, which was treated with medication, but you're not sure if you're still taking it. And you experience some fatigue, which you also attribute to age. It's okay that you’re not certain about the medication – we can check your records, or I can take a look at any pills you are currently taking. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think, let me think… Oh! Yes. A long time ago. When I was… younger. I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee once, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. Mostly just a little… scrape, I think. Nothing major. I don't go to the hospital much. I try to stay out of there, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past and a minor knee procedure. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pills we're trying to figure out?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I have these little ones… for my… vitamins. Yes, vitamins. I take a multivitamin, and… something for my bones. My doctor said my bones were gettin’ a little weak, so I take something for that. And… oh, and a little something to help me sleep sometimes. When I can't sleep, that is. It's all a bit of a blur, you know? My husband keeps track of it all, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a multivitamin, something for bone health, and a sleep aid as needed. It's very helpful that you have these, and it’s great your husband assists with keeping track. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes when I eat strawberries, but that’s just a little… rash. Nothing serious. My husband says I’m lucky, I don’t have any of those… fancy allergies that people have these days. I've always been pretty good with food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known significant allergies, just a possible mild reaction to strawberries. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… well, my mother, she had… something with her heart. I think. She was always a little… weak, you know? And my father, he had… diabetes, I think. Yes, diabetes. He had to watch what he ate. And… my brother, he had… problems with his kidneys, I think. But that was a long time ago. It’s all a bit of a blur, you know? I don’t really keep track of all that sort of thing. Families are big, you know? Lots of people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and kidney issues. That’s good to know. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. Never had the taste for it. My husband, he used to smoke a little, when we were younger, but he quit a long time ago. He said it wasn’t good for him. And I always told him it wasn't good for me either, you know? So, no, never smoked. Always liked fresh air.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've never smoked, and your husband previously smoked but has quit. Now, about alcohol – do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit sometimes. Mostly on special occasions. A little glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a little sip of champagne on Christmas. Nothing much. Not a regular drinker, no. It doesn't really agree with me, if I'm honest. Makes me a little… sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a small amount of alcohol on special occasions. Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd also like to check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam. This will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don't mind. Just… be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know. But yes, go ahead. If it helps you figure things out, then do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be very gentle. Your heart sounds regular, with a normal rate. I don't hear any murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, with good airflow. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. It’s a little bit… full, as you mentioned, but that could be normal. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common with age, but otherwise, your neurological exam is normal. Your balance seems stable. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, the physical exam didn’t reveal anything particularly concerning. Based on everything you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder, possibly with some difficulty emptying completely. This can be common as we age, and it’s often related to changes in the bladder muscle and the nerves that control it. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, like a urinary tract infection or a blockage. To do that, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection and a post-void residual volume to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary. A urine test… and something about my bladder? Yes, go ahead. I just want to feel… normal again, you know? It’s just… bothersome, having to go so often and not being able to empty everything. So yes, do what you need to do. And… how long will that take? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. It's definitely bothersome, and it's good we're trying to figure this out. The urine test is very simple. You'll just need to provide a sample in a cup. It doesn’t hurt at all. As for the post-void residual volume, it involves a quick ultrasound of your bladder after you urinate to see how much urine is left. That doesn’t hurt either, it's just like having a scan. The lab should be able to process the urine test quickly, and we can usually get the results back within a day or two. The ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water throughout the day, but avoid drinking large amounts right before bedtime. You can also try to double-void – meaning, urinate, wait a few minutes, and then try to urinate again to make sure you’ve emptied your bladder completely. Do those suggestions sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Drinking water… that's easy enough. I always try to drink enough water. And… double-void? That sounds… alright. I can try that. And… tomorrow morning for the scan? Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever works. I just… I hope it's nothing serious, you know? I don’t want to be a bother, and I don’t want to have to go to the hospital. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's absolutely not too much to ask, Ms. Stoffregen. You deserve to feel better. And it’s perfectly normal to be anxious about this. We’re going to take things one step at a time. The urine test and the ultrasound will give us more information, and we’ll go from there. Most likely, this is something we can manage with simple lifestyle changes or medication. And we’ll do everything we can to avoid a hospital stay, I promise. I’ll have the nurse schedule the ultrasound for you tomorrow morning. She'll also give you instructions on how to prepare for it. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or if you’re unable to urinate at all, please contact the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. And… thank you. Thank you for listening to me and for not making me feel like a bother. I… I just want to get this sorted out, you know? And… get back to my normal life. But… thank you. That’s all. I’ll see you tomorrow for the scan then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m happy to help. And I understand completely. We’ll get this sorted out together. Yes, I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the scan. The nurse will let you know the exact time. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Stoffregen. I hope you have a restful evening.
