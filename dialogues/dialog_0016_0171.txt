DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. It’s… the nails. They just look… off. I don’t even know how to explain it good. They ain’t been lookin’ right for a while now. I think. Maybe a month? Something like that. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, "off" is a good start. And a month is helpful, roughly. Can you describe what "off" means?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda… yellow. And thick. Not all of ‘em, just some. And they feel… hard. Like, not normal nail hard, but… tougher. I don’t do nothin’ special to ‘em, never have. I just… cut ‘em when they get long. I don’t paint ‘em or nothin’. Fancy stuff ain’t for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing and thickening, particularly on some nails, and a harder texture… that gives me a better idea. Do you notice any changes in the shape of the nails themselves?
PATIENT: Shape? Hmm… I dunno. They look like nails. I guess… maybe one is kinda bendy? But it always been like that one. I don’t think the others changed shape. I ain’t lookin’ at my nails that close, ya know? I got other things on my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, definitely. Okay, and are the nails painful at all?
PATIENT: Nah, no pain. Not a bit. That’s why I didn’t rush right over here. If it hurt, I woulda come sooner. It just… looks weird. And my sister, she said I oughta get it checked out. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain is good. And it's always good to listen to family, even if they do worry! Have you noticed any changes around the nails, like redness, swelling, or any discharge?
PATIENT: Discharge? Like… pus? Oh, no. Not that I seen. Redness… maybe a little around the edges of one or two, but not much. Could just be from cuttin’ ‘em, I reckon. I ain’t real gentle, if I’m bein’ honest. It’s hard to get a good grip.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Alright, let's take a look at your hands and nails. Could you please extend your hands, palms up, for me?
PATIENT: Alright, here ya go. Be gentle now, ya hear? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There's definitely some yellow discoloration and thickening, particularly on these nails here. I’m also noticing a little bit of ridging. The skin around the nails looks mostly normal, though there's a slight redness at the base of a few. It doesn't seem infected, but we'll want to rule things out. It looks like you may have a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It's pretty common. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: Fungal… what now? Sounds fancy. No, I don’t got no diabetes. And my immune system is fine, as far as I know. I get sick like everybody else, but not more than everybody else. I just… get old faster, I think. Single, ya know? Stress’ll do that to ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, “single” doesn’t typically cause fungal infections, but I understand. No diabetes is good. And it's good to hear you haven't been sick more often than usual. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure pills. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my aches and pains, when they’re real bad. It’s… I think it’s ibuprofen? The white ones. I don’t really pay attention to the names. My niece gets ‘em for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen is good to know. And you mentioned blood pressure pills – do you know the name of those, or about how long you’ve been taking them?
PATIENT: Umm… lemme think. They’re little blue ones. And… I dunno, maybe five years? Six? I ain’t good with dates. I get ‘em refilled every few months, that’s all I know. My doctor, Dr. Habib, he handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, little blue pills for about five or six years. That’s helpful. Alright, Lacreasha, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it does seem likely this is a fungal nail infection. To be sure, we could do a test to confirm – a small clipping of the nail sent to a lab. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A lab, huh? Sounds… expensive. Will Medicare cover it? I don’t wanna get a big bill. And… does it hurt? I don’t do good with needles.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Medicare should cover it, yes, especially since it’s necessary to determine the best course of treatment. We’ll verify that with the insurance company before we proceed, so you won’t have any surprise bills. And no, it doesn’t involve a needle! It’s just a tiny clipping of the nail, like trimming it a little shorter. It doesn't hurt at all. It’s quick and easy. Would you like me to go ahead and order that test for you?
PATIENT: Alright… if it don’t hurt and Medicare’s gonna pay for it… go ahead. But be gentle, ya hear? And tell ‘em to hurry up. I don’t wanna be waitin’ forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfectly gentle, I promise. And we’ll get it sent to the lab as quickly as possible. I’ll also give you a handout with some general information about fungal nail infections while we wait for the results. In the meantime, try to keep your nails trimmed as best you can and dry. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get a little itchy when I wore cheap jewelry, but that was a long time ago. And once, I ate some bad shrimp and my face swelled up, but that wasn’t a medication. Just bad shrimp. I don’t take nothin’ fancy, so I doubt I’m allergic to anythin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No known medication allergies. Alright, let me just get this small clipping… it might feel a little pressure, but shouldn't hurt. Okay, all done. I'll send this off to the lab, and we should have results back in about a week or so. We'll call you as soon as we get them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week… alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… what happens if it is that fungus thing? Will I have to take pills? ‘Cause I don’t like takin’ pills.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. If it is confirmed to be a fungal infection, treatment usually involves either topical medication – a nail polish you apply to the nail – or oral medication – pills. The best option depends on the severity of the infection and your overall health. We'll discuss all the options in detail once we have the lab results and I can review your medical history more thoroughly. We can absolutely explore the topical option first, if you prefer. It’s less convenient, as it takes longer to work, but it avoids the need for pills. Would you like me to make a note of that preference in your chart?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Put it in there. No pills if ya can help it. I get enough aches and pains as it is, don’t need no more from medicine. And… thank ya, Dr. Maskal. You’re very patient with an old lady like me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Lacreasha. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as we have those lab results. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – like increased redness, swelling, or pain – please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's a copy of the handout, and the number to reach us is on the front. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… try not to make me wait too long for the phone call, okay? I get worried when I gotta wait. Thank ya again, Dr. Maskal. You been real nice.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. I understand, and I promise we'll get in touch as soon as the results are available. I’ll make sure your chart is flagged so we prioritize your call. Have a good day, and please take care.
