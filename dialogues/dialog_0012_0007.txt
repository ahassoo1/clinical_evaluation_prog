DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My back… it is painful. Very painful, actually. I would like to know what is causing it, if you can tell me. I do not have much time, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain is definitely something we can look into. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. When did the pain start?
PATIENT: It began… let me think. Approximately three weeks ago, I believe. July 10th, if I recall correctly. I was erecting a fence… post holes, mostly. Heavy work.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 10th, while doing fence work. That gives us a good starting point. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It is… a sharp ache, mostly. Down my lower back, and sometimes it goes into my… hip. Both sides, but the left side is worse. It hurts when I bend, or lift things, naturally. Even sitting for too long is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp ache radiating down your lower back into both hips, worse on the left, and aggravated by bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yes. Lying flat, with a pillow under my knees, helps some. And… warm baths. They ease the ache, temporarily. But it always returns, when I move about. It is a constant companion, this pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying flat with a pillow under your knees and warm baths provide some relief, but it’s temporary. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness. No tingling. My legs… they feel strong enough. I can walk, I can stand… it just hurts when I do. The pain is the main problem, not a lack of strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. Have you had any issues with your bladder or bowel function – any trouble starting or stopping, or any changes in how often you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything… functions as it should. I have not noticed any changes in that regard. I apologize, but this is rather personal. I do hope you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lakiya, and appreciate you sharing that information. No changes in bladder or bowel function is helpful to know. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever had back pain like this before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have had aches and pains from work, of course, but nothing like this. This is… different. More severe. And it has not gone away. It lingers, constantly. I have always been strong, always able to work. This is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is a new type of pain for you, and it’s persistent. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past – things like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been quite healthy, all my life. Just… the usual aches and pains from hard work. No serious illnesses. My husband… he had some heart trouble, before he passed, but I do not. I have Medicare, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. And thank you for mentioning your Medicare – that’s helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I have always avoided them, if possible. I prefer to… tough it out, as they say. But this pain… it is beyond my ability to ignore. It is interfering with my work, and that is not acceptable.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries. And I understand your frustration with it interfering with work. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, or children – have back problems, arthritis, or any other conditions that might be relevant?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some trouble with her joints, as she got older. Arthritis, I believe. And my brother… he injured his back lifting logs, years ago. He recovered, mostly, but he always had some aches and pains afterward. But that is all I can recall, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had arthritis and your brother had a back injury. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. Never had any interest in it, truthfully. My husband… he smoked a pipe, but I did not. I have always preferred fresh air, whenever possible. It is important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don't smoke. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. Perhaps once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. Just a small glass. It helps me relax, sometimes. But I do not drink every day, if that is what you are asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. Finally, do you currently take any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. And I do not have any allergies, as far as I am aware. I have always been careful with what I put into my body. I prefer natural remedies, whenever possible. Is that all? I would like to finish, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or allergies. That’s very helpful. Alright, Lakiya. Based on what you’ve told me – the sharp ache radiating down your lower back, worsened by bending and lifting, relieved somewhat by lying flat with a pillow and warm baths, and no red flags like numbness, weakness, or bowel/bladder changes – it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain, possibly with some muscle spasm. The fence work was likely the inciting event. Now, to confirm this, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A strain… that is what you believe? Yes, Doctor, that sounds reasonable. The fence work was strenuous. And yes, a physical exam… I suppose that is necessary. But please be gentle. This pain is quite severe, as you know. I would like to finish as quickly as possible, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Lakiya, I’m going to have you lie flat on your back. I'll gently feel along your spine and the muscles in your lower back to check for tenderness and spasm. Then I’ll have you bend forward, backward, and to each side to see how that affects your pain and range of motion. I will also check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Let me know immediately if anything causes sharp pain or discomfort. Okay, I'm noting some tenderness in your lower back, particularly on this side, and some discomfort with bending. Your reflexes and strength are normal, which is good. I don’t see any signs of nerve compression at this point. It certainly sounds like a muscle strain, likely aggravated by spasm.
PATIENT: A muscle strain… that is what you believe? And no nerve compression… that is reassuring. So, what does this mean? What can be done to alleviate the pain? I have work to do, you see. I cannot afford to be laid up for long. Is there a medication I can take? Or some sort of… treatment? I would like to know my options, if that is alright. And quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a muscle strain, no nerve compression is a good start. Now, to alleviate the pain, the good news is most lumbar strains improve with conservative treatment. That means things like: Rest: Avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Ice: Apply ice packs to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially in the first few days. Heat: After the first few days, you can switch to heat – warm baths, heating pads – to help relax the muscles. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen can also help with pain, but doesn’t address the inflammation. Gentle stretching: Once the initial pain subsides, gentle stretching can help improve flexibility and prevent stiffness. For medication, over-the-counter options are usually sufficient. If the pain is severe and not responding to those, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant. However, those can cause drowsiness, so it’s important to be careful. I also recommend a course of physical therapy – they can teach you specific exercises to strengthen your back muscles and prevent future strains. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, heat… over-the-counter medication… Yes, I can manage that. I have used ice packs before, for minor injuries. And a muscle relaxant… only if necessary. I do not wish to be drowsy, as you say. Physical therapy… that may be helpful, but it will take time. So, no serious injury? No surgery required? I would like to confirm that, if you do not mind. And is there anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should watch for? I would like to finish this consultation, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lakiya, based on the exam and your history, it does not appear to be a serious injury. No surgery is required. The vast majority of lumbar strains resolve with conservative treatment. Now, regarding warning signs, it’s important to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the following: Severe pain that doesn’t improve with rest and medication. Numbness or tingling in your legs or feet. Weakness in your legs. Loss of bowel or bladder control. Fever. Those could indicate a more serious problem, such as a nerve compression or infection. I'm going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just in case. I’ll also give you a handout with information about lumbar strains and exercises you can do. I'll put in an order for a referral to physical therapy. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. A muscle relaxant, as a precaution… and the handout… very good. Thank you for your time, and for your reassurance. I do appreciate it. I will follow your instructions carefully. I would like to finish now, if that is alright. I have work to do, you see. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lakiya. Here you are. Take it easy, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
