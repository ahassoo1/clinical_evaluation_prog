DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long. It’s…well, it’s just the runs. Non-stop. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and nothing’s working. It’s embarrassing to even talk about, but I’m losing weight and can barely leave the house.
DOCTOR: “The runs,” you say. Well, that’s… descriptive. And you’ve been dealing with this for how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know, a couple of weeks, maybe? It feels longer when you're constantly running to the bathroom. Look, I don't keep a calendar of my digestive issues, okay? I just know it's not normal and I’m starting to feel…weak. It’s just frustrating that nothing seems to stop it.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. Alright. And have you noticed anything with the runs?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. Of course I have! What do you mean? It's not like it's a pleasant experience. There's… cramping, obviously. And it’s not just water, if you know what I mean. It's… loose. Really loose. Sometimes there’s… well, you don't need the details. It's just… awful. And I’ve been trying to eat bland stuff, but it doesn’t even seem to matter.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to be graphic. Loose stools, cramping… and it’s not improving with a bland diet. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside this?
PATIENT: No fever. No throwing up. Just…this. Constant, awful…emptying. I’m just tired of it. I’ve always been healthy. I don’t understand why this is happening now. And honestly, I don’t have time for this. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Work, yes. Well, these things happen. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No! I haven’t left town in months. I paint houses, remember? It’s not exactly a glamorous job that takes me all over the world. I’ve been working on old Mrs. Abernathy’s place down the street, that's about it. It's probably something I ate. Though I can't for the life of me figure out what.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just my vitamins. A multivitamin, and some fish oil. I try to take care of myself. I mean, I was healthy, before all of this started. Nothing else. Not for anything chronic, or anything like that. I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Look, I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it, okay? I don’t need a life history lesson, or a quiz about my diet. I've told you I'm trying to figure this out, and I’m at my wit’s end. It’s been weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's not get testy. I’m just trying to get a clear picture. Now, have you experienced any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You’re asking me that? Look, I already told you I don't want to get into the details. It's not a pleasant topic. No, I haven't seen any blood. If I had, I wouldn’t be sitting here, wasting my time, would I? I'm not stupid. I know when something is serious. This is just… persistent. And ruining my life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a quick listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll need to check your vitals. It's standard procedure, Ms. Woodring. Don’t be so quick to dismiss everything. Sometimes things aren't as obvious as they seem. Please, lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect me to enjoy this. And hurry it up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, Ms. Woodring. In…and out… Yes. I do hear some…increased bowel sounds. Nothing alarming, but definitely active. Your blood pressure is 120 over 80, pulse is 78, and temperature is normal. Weight is 52 kilograms, which, according to my records, is a bit of a decrease from your last visit. You said you've been losing weight?
PATIENT: Yes, I said that! I’m starting to feel…hollow. My clothes are loose. It’s obvious! Honestly, are you even listening to me? I’m not sitting here for fun. I need to know what’s causing this and how to stop it. It's just… frustrating. It's getting worse, and I'm losing weight. What are you thinking? Some kind of bug? Or is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, given your symptoms – persistent diarrhea, cramping, no fever, no vomiting, and the weight loss – it could be a few things. It's unlikely to be a severe, acute infection, as those typically present with more pronounced symptoms. We could consider Irritable Bowel Syndrome, but the weight loss is concerning. I'm going to order a stool sample to rule out any parasitic or bacterial infection. And I’d also like to do a blood test to check for inflammation and nutritional deficiencies. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Really? That's…lovely. And a blood test. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just…get it over with. I have a job to finish, you know. I’m not spending all day in here. And when can I expect results? I need to know something soon. This is really impacting my life, and I’m not exactly known for my patience.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the stool sample collection. Results usually take 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a bland diet and staying hydrated. And try not to stress so much. Anxiety can exacerbate digestive issues. If your symptoms worsen significantly – high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Bland diet, stay hydrated, don't panic, and watch for blood. You've covered it. Thank you for your…thoroughness. I'll be going now. I’ll expect a call in a few days with the results. Don't bother calling if it's nothing, though. I’m a busy woman.
