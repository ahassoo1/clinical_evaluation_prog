DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Angelle Shteynberg, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Look, Doctor… Gorga, is it? Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Gorga. And I understand. Time is… valuable. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It says it right there on the form, doesn’t it? I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens. I don’t want any… complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I need a straightforward answer, not a lot of beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Right, fertility concerns. Yes, I see that. Okay. To be… thorough, let's just go over a few things. Have you been trying for a while?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, Doctor, not actively. I just… assumed. I was married, it should have happened, didn’t it? And now… well, now I’m divorced and I want to know if there’s a problem. Is that so difficult to understand? I’d rather just make it happen, if you catch my drift. No wasting time.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. So, you haven’t been tracking cycles or anything like that?
PATIENT: Tracking? Good heavens, no! I have a business to run, I repair bicycles! I don’t have time for… calendars and thermometers. Honestly, Doctor, do you think I just sit around waiting for… things to happen? It’s rather insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay. And… approximately when was your divorce finalized?
PATIENT: Two years ago, in March. A complete waste of ten years, if you ask me. He was… not a practical man. Kept wanting to buy antique doilies instead of useful things. But that's beside the point. The point is, I want a baby, and I need to know if I’m still… capable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, just to be clear, have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. It was… not a priority then. I was building my business. Now it is. And I’m not interested in a lecture about waiting until the “right time”, Doctor. I’m here for solutions, not a history lesson.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history then. Any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, fell off a very tall fence trying to rescue a cat. And I had my appendix out when I was thirty. Other than that, I’m perfectly healthy. I work hard, I eat sensible food, and I don’t drink or smoke. I don’t have time for nonsense. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None. I’ve never needed anything stronger than aspirin. A bicycle repairwoman doesn’t get sick, Doctor. We build character. And strong immune systems. Now, are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to talk about my life story all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, weight… I see here you’re 5’1” and 190 pounds. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I am not 5’1”. I’m almost six feet tall! And 186 centimeters, to be precise. And I weigh 86 kilograms. Honestly, Doctor, do you even read the forms? This is ridiculous. Are you sure you’re a doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh. My apologies. You are correct. 186 centimeters, 86 kilograms. I… I seem to be having a bit of a day. Alright. Let’s proceed. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then a quick abdominal exam. Would you mind stepping up on the scale to confirm?
PATIENT: Confirm what? I told you my weight! Honestly, the incompetence! Fine. But don't expect me to linger. I have bicycles to fix, you know. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, have you been having any pain, anywhere?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy! Pain is for weak people. I lift heavy things all day, I don’t have time for aches and pains. Are you going to actually do something about this, or just poke and prod me forever? I’m starting to think I’ve wasted my time coming here.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need some blood work to check your hormone levels and ovarian reserve. And I’d like to do a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your uterus and ovaries. It’s standard procedure, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Honestly, Doctor, do you think I’m an idiot? I know what that involves. And frankly, it sounds… unpleasant. And hormone levels? I’m a perfectly functional woman! But… fine. If it’s absolutely necessary. But I want it over with quickly, and I expect a clear explanation of the results, not a lot of medical jargon. And if you find anything wrong, I want options. Practical options. No lectures about my age, understood? I’m not interested in a miracle, just… solutions. And quickly. Now, let’s get it over with.
