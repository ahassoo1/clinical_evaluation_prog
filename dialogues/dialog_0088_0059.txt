DOCTOR: Hello Adyn, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been a bit off lately. Not as clear as it usually is, you see. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. It just… happened gradually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your speech hasn't been as clear as usual, and it came on gradually. That’s helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about how it's off?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… difficult to explain. Sometimes the words just feel… thick, I suppose? And I stumble over them a bit more than I used to. My husband says I slur sometimes, but I don’t always notice it myself. It’s rather frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “thick” and stumbling, and your husband has noticed some slurring. That is frustrating. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It’s not all the time, thankfully. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and other days… like today, it's more noticeable. I haven’t really noticed anything that makes it worse, or better, specifically. It just… varies. It’s been maybe a week or so of it being particularly troublesome, though.
DOCTOR: A week of it being particularly troublesome, with no obvious triggers. Alright. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or changes to your voice – like hoarseness?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I have been choking on my water a bit more than usual. It’s nothing major, just a little cough, but it’s happened a couple of times this past week as well. My voice… I don’t think so? My husband hasn't said anything about it sounding different.
DOCTOR: Okay, choking on water and no voice changes. That's good information. Have you had any other symptoms – weakness, numbness, headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No weakness, no. No numbness either. Headaches… I get them occasionally, but nothing different than usual, really. And no dizziness, thankfully. Vision is fine, I believe. No changes there. It really is just the speech and the little bit of trouble swallowing, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold or the flu – or any injuries to your head or neck?
PATIENT: I did have a little cold about a month ago, but it wasn’t anything serious. Just a stuffy nose and a bit of a cough for a few days. It cleared up quickly. No injuries, no. I’m usually quite careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold a month ago, and no injuries. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: To be honest, Doctor, I can’t recall anything specific. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. My husband usually handles the medical things. He would know more about that sort of thing, I suspect. I do take a daily vitamin, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses, just a daily vitamin. That's okay, we can often get information from records if needed. Are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the vitamin, really. Nothing else. I don't like taking too many pills if I can avoid it, you see. I take a multivitamin, that’s all. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take paracetamol, but that’s very infrequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional paracetamol. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband says I’m very lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – like stroke, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis – in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical information, you see. I know my grandmother had something… with her memory, towards the end of her life, but I don’t know what it was specifically. And my uncle had some trouble walking when he got older, but again, I don’t know the details. It’s not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible memory issues in your grandmother and walking difficulties in your uncle, but no specific diagnoses known. That's helpful to know, even if it’s limited information. And finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely. And absolutely not, no recreational drugs. I lead a very quiet life, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright. I'll check your cranial nerves, your strength, and your reflexes. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head?
PATIENT: Certainly. Like this? Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I’m going to shine a light in each of your eyes. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels a bit… strange, having it examined, but I’m happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, I’m going to ask you to say "ah." Good. Now, can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It feels a bit silly, but I'm doing my best.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now I'm going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that strong enough? I usually do a bit of gardening, so my hands are fairly strong, I think.
DOCTOR: Good. That's excellent strength. Now, let's check your reflexes. Okay. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to hear. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn. Based on the examination, your strength and reflexes are normal. Your cranial nerves are intact, and your heart and lungs sound clear. The speech issues are subtle, and the choking on water is concerning, but not immediately alarming. Given your symptoms – the gradual onset of speech changes, occasional choking, and lack of significant neurological deficits – it’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause without further investigation. There are a number of possibilities, ranging from something relatively benign to something requiring more attention. I'd like to order some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm thinking a referral to an ENT specialist for a swallowing study and voice evaluation would be a good start. I’d also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it helps to find out what’s going on, I’m happy to have the tests. An MRI sounds a bit… daunting, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgement. And an ENT specialist… yes, that makes sense with the choking.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm glad you feel that way. The MRI is just a precaution, and the ENT specialist will be able to assess your swallowing more thoroughly. I'll write the referrals now. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased difficulty swallowing, significant changes in your speech, or new symptoms like weakness or numbness – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll also give you a list of warning signs to look out for. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. It’s a lot to take in, of course, but I feel reassured knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. Thank you for your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I understand it can be concerning. We'll work through this together. My nurse will schedule the referrals for you before you leave. Here's a copy of your visit summary and the list of warning signs. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and please take care.
