DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... cough. Yeah, I got cough. Long time already. And... feel tired all the time. Also, my nose... always block, then runny. Happens a lot. I think sinus, maybe? I dunno. Sorry, I forget things easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion… for how long exactly have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Long time… really long. Maybe… six months? Or more? I really can’t say for sure. Things kinda… blur together, you know? I work a lot, fixing tires. Dusty work. Maybe from that? I don’t remember when it started started, just that it’s been a while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Six months or more... and you think it might be related to the dust at work?
PATIENT: Yeah, probably. Lots of dust, and sometimes… smells funny. Not always bad, but… different. I wear a mask, but… maybe not good enough? I dunno. It’s just… tiring to always be coughing and feeling weak. Makes work harder. And my wife… she worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the cough, fatigue and nasal congestion, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… a little bit of headache. Not bad, just… there. And… uh… sometimes feel a little warm. Not fever, I don’t think. Just… warm. Like after working in the sun. I don't know if that makes sense. I don't really check my temperature. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Headache and feeling warm… Do you have any trouble breathing at all, or any chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Coughing just… hurts my throat sometimes. And no trouble breathing… not really. Just… when I really cough a lot, I get a little… winded. But it goes away. It's not like… I can't breathe, you know? Just tired after.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any colored mucus when you cough, or is it clear?
PATIENT: Uh… colored? I don’t… I don't really look. Sorry. I just… cough into a tissue. Usually it’s… white-ish, I think? Sometimes a little yellow? I don't pay much attention. Is that… bad? I feel silly even talking about this.
DOCTOR: It's alright. We need to gather information. Yellow mucus can indicate an infection. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. Never been to the doctor much. Just… small things. Headaches, colds… nothing serious. My wife always takes care of me when I’m sick. She gives me medicine from the shop. I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. But nothing… diagnosed. Sorry. I don't remember much from before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been to the hospital. Not even broken a bone! I work with tires all day… sometimes I pinch my fingers, but nothing serious. Just a little owie. My wife bandages it up. No hospital, I promise. I'm a strong man! Just… tired now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my wife, of course. And my mother, she’s still in Malaysia. I haven't seen her in a long time. She’s… old. She gets coughs sometimes too, when the weather is cold. But she always gets better. I don’t know if anyone else in my family had… this kind of cough. I don't really talk to them much. Sorry. It's been a long time since I see them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, or are you exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never tried it. My wife doesn't smoke either. We try to be healthy. The shop… sometimes people smoke outside, but I don't stand near them. I don't like the smell. It makes my throat itchy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes I take medicine for the headache. Paracetamol, I think? From the shop. And my wife… she gives me syrup for the cough. Red one. I don't know the name. Just… cough syrup. It helps a little, but not much. And sometimes… a little bit of vitamin C. Just to feel better. Sorry, I don't know much about medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I can stand. A little sore, but okay. Is something wrong, Doctor? I'm a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in... and out... Okay, good. Your breathing sounds a little… wheezy. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… a little tickle. Like something stuck in my throat. The wheezy… is that bad? My wife says I snore a lot, maybe that's it? I don't know what wheezy means, Doctor. Sorry. Is it serious? I need to go back to work soon.
DOCTOR: It could indicate some airway inflammation. Your temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit. Slightly elevated. And your sinuses are a little tender to the touch. Your ears look clear. I’m going to recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any lung infection, and a complete blood count to see if there's an active infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? Oh… okay. Is it… expensive? I don't have much money. And… will it take long? I really need to go back to work. My boss… he’s not very understanding. But… if you think it’s important, I’ll do it. I just… worry about the cost. And being away from work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The X-ray and blood work will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I can write you a referral to the clinic down the road, they have a payment assistance program. It may take a few hours to get the results. We can discuss them when you come back. In the meantime, I recommend getting some rest and drinking plenty of fluids. I’m also going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It won’t fix the problem, but it will give you some temporary relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… a payment program, that's good. And the inhaler… temporary relief is okay. Anything to get back to work. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. So… rest, fluids, and the inhaler… and then the X-ray and blood test at the other clinic? I can do that. Is there anything else I need to know? Will the inhaler make me sleepy? My wife will be worried if I'm sleepy.
DOCTOR: The inhaler shouldn’t make you significantly sleepy, but some people experience mild side effects like a racing heart or jitteriness. If you experience those, let me know. Avoid caffeine and sugary drinks while using it. The referral note has the clinic’s address and phone number. They’ll explain the payment process when you call. And if your symptoms worsen—high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain—go to the emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No caffeine, no sugar, and… emergency room if it gets bad. Thank you, Doctor Korrell. You've been very helpful. I'll go to the other clinic tomorrow. I hope it's not too expensive. I think… I think that’s all I needed to know. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Tati. And don’t delay getting those tests done. .
