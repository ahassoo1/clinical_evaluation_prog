DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer treatment, you see. It’s mostly in my legs and… feet, I think. It’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm, swelling, alright. And you mentioned after cancer treatment… Just to clarify, was this recent, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… not super recent. The treatment finished… maybe six months ago? It was okay for a while, and then it started, slow at first. Now… well, now it’s more noticeable. It’s hard to say exactly when, you know? I don’t pay attention to dates so much.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, building up gradually… that’s helpful. And where exactly is the swelling most prominent?
PATIENT: Mostly my ankles, I think. And… the tops of my feet, a little. Sometimes my calves feel tight too. It’s both legs, pretty much the same. It’s not… painful, exactly. Just… heavy. And makes shoes hard to get on.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles, tops of the feet, calves… both legs, feeling heavy, difficulty with shoes. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the areas that are swollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. No redness. And… not really warm either. Just… puffy, I guess? Like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Puffy, no redness or warmth. Alright. And have you experienced any shortness of breath, or noticed any changes in your urination lately – like needing to go more or less frequently?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a little… out of breath walking up hills, but that’s just… being my age, I think. And… no change in… going to the bathroom. No, everything is normal there.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Besides the cancer treatment, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I had a bad knee for a while, needed some physical therapy. Nothing major, I don’t think. Just… old lady problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Nothing major, alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. And my brother… he had diabetes. That’s… about all I remember, really. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Just… a little pill for my blood pressure. And a vitamin D one, the doctor told me I was low. That's it, I think. I’ll have to check my purse… but I’m pretty sure that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication and Vitamin D… good. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of! Never had a problem with any pill or anything. I can eat anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, would you mind if I take a quick look at your legs and feet?
PATIENT: Oh, no, go ahead! Whatever you need to do. I’m not shy. Just… be gentle, okay? My skin is… old.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will. Alright, let's see… I’m feeling some definite swelling in your ankles, and around the tops of your feet. Skin feels warm to the touch, and there's a little bit of pitting edema when I press. And I don’t see any redness or open sores, which is good. It does appear to be bilateral – meaning both legs are affected equally.
PATIENT: Pitting edema? What's that mean, exactly? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It just means when I press on your skin, it leaves a little indentation for a little while. It's a sign of fluid buildup. It's not necessarily bad, but it's something we need to investigate further. It can be caused by a number of things, especially after cancer treatment. We’ll need some blood work to get a better picture. Have you been retaining any fluid in other areas of your body recently?
PATIENT: Fluid… hmm. Maybe a little bit? My fingers feel a little… puffy sometimes. And I thought my face looked a bit rounder. But I thought that was just… eating too much chocolate!
DOCTOR: It could be! But we want to rule out other causes. Alright, Sasha, based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you're likely experiencing some lymphedema and/or venous insufficiency, possibly related to your cancer treatment. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any other underlying conditions. We’ll also want to check your albumin levels, which can tell us about your protein levels and help explain the fluid retention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot of tests. Lymphedema… I think I heard something about that before. Is it… serious? I just want to be able to wear my shoes again!
DOCTOR: It can be managed, Sasha, and it's not necessarily serious if we catch it early. Lymphedema happens when there's a buildup of lymph fluid because the lymphatic system isn't draining properly. Your cancer treatment might have affected that. The blood tests will help us figure out the best course of action. While we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your legs when you’re resting, and wearing compression stockings. They can help reduce the swelling. I'm going to write you a prescription for those. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… oh dear. Those sound… tight. Will they be uncomfortable? And… how long do I have to wear them? I really don’t like anything squeezing me.
DOCTOR: They do take some getting used to, I understand. We'll start with a lower compression level and see how you tolerate them. They're meant to provide support, not be overly restrictive. You should wear them during the day, and can take them off at night. We can adjust the level if they’re uncomfortable. In the meantime, I’m also going to give you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. They can teach you specific exercises to help improve drainage and reduce swelling. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… okay. That sounds… good, I guess. If they can help me wear my shoes again, that would be wonderful. But… will it hurt? I don't want anything painful.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be painful at all, Sasha. The physical therapist will use gentle techniques, like manual lymphatic drainage, and teach you exercises that are tailored to your needs. They'll focus on improving circulation and reducing swelling. We’ll aim for comfort and improvement, not pain. I'm writing up a summary of everything we discussed, including the blood tests, the compression stocking prescription, and the referral to the physical therapist. I’ll also send this information to your primary care doctor. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. It’s… a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything. Hopefully, I can wear my shoes again soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. It is a lot, and it's alright to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse can also help answer any questions about the blood tests or the referral. I’ll see you back in two weeks to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
