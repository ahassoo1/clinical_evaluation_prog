DOCTOR: Hi Betty, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. What was I comin' in for now? Oh… right. My ears. They just… don't work so good anymore, I guess. It's been goin' on a while, can’t quite recall how long. Everything's a bit muffled, like talkin' underwater.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing… that can definitely be frustrating. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “A while” is a bit vague – would you say it's been happening for weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I think. Maybe longer than that even. Time just… slips away, ya know? I used to be able to hear the birds singin' clear as a bell, but now… not so much. It's probably been over a year, if I had to guess. Could be two… I really couldn’t say for certain.
DOCTOR: I understand, time does slip away! Okay, so over a year, potentially two years of gradually worsening hearing. Has it been getting steadily worse, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Steadily, I think. Though sometimes it feels worse than others. Like if there's a lot of noise, it gets real hard to make out what folks are sayin’. Quiet places are a bit better, but even then, it’s not what it used to be. I just end up noddin' and smilin' a lot, hopin' I don’t miss somethin' important.
DOCTOR: That sounds really tough, Betty. It's good you're aware of it and came in to get it checked. Okay, so it's been gradually worsening, and worse in noisy environments. Do you notice it in one ear more than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think it's the left ear. Not always, but when it's real bad, it's usually in that one. The right one’s okay most of the time, just a bit quiet overall. I haven't really paid close attention to it, to be honest. It's all a bit of a muddle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily the left ear, but overall both ears are quieter than they used to be. I'm going to do a quick ear exam, if that's alright with you. I'll use an otoscope to take a look inside both ears, and then we can do a quick hearing test just to get an idea of how things are. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds fine, dear. Whatever you think is best. An otos… what did you call it? Never mind, don’t worry about it. As long as you can tell me what's goin' on, that's all that matters. Go right ahead. I just hope it’s nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. I'm just going to use this little light and instrument – it's called an otoscope – to look inside your ears. It doesn't hurt, but I may need to gently pull your earlobe to get a good view. Okay… I see some cerumen – that's earwax – in both ears, a bit more on the left side. The ear canals themselves look clear, no signs of inflammation or infection. The tympanic membranes – that’s your eardrums – look a little dull in color, which could indicate some fluid build-up. Now, I'm going to do a quick hearing screening. I'll place these headphones on and play some tones at different pitches and volumes. Just let me know when you can hear them, even if it's very faint. Sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… complicated. Fluid, you say? I don’t like the sound of that. But alright, I trust you, dear. Headphones, right? Just tell me when I hear somethin'. I’ll try my best. It's just… hard sometimes, like things are muffled, ya know? Don't worry if I get it wrong. I'm an old woman, what do ya expect?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Betty. We're just getting a baseline here, and it's fine if you don't hear everything. It’s completely normal to have some difficulty, especially with a bit of muffled hearing. And it doesn’t mean anything about you at all, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know, dear. You're a kind doctor. Alright, let's get it over with then. Just let me know when it starts, and I’ll do my best to tell ya when I hear somethin’. I'm a little nervous now, to be honest. Old ears ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty, I'm going to start now. I'll be playing some tones, and just raise your hand when you hear something – anything at all, even a very quiet beep. We'll start with your right ear. Alright, Betty, we're all done. Let me take a look at the results… Okay, the results show mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, more pronounced in the higher frequencies – those are the softer, higher-pitched sounds. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss, which is very common. The left ear does have a bit more loss than the right, as we suspected. It looks like there’s no sudden change, which is good. It seems like a gradual decline over time.
PATIENT: Oh. Mild to moderate, you say? Sounds… serious. Is it bad? Will I go completely deaf? I’ve always been a bit worried about that, with my family history and all. Gradual, you say? Well, at least it wasn't sudden, like you said. Still… is there anything I can do about it? I don’t want to lose what little hearing I have left.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Betty. "Moderate" does sound concerning, but it doesn’t mean you'll go completely deaf. It means you're having difficulty hearing certain sounds, especially quieter ones, and it’s impacting your ability to understand speech. There are things we can do to help! The most common option is hearing aids. They can amplify those sounds you're missing and greatly improve your hearing. We can also discuss strategies for communication, like asking people to speak clearly and facing you when they talk. Before we talk about hearing aids, I'd like to refer you to an audiologist. They are specialists in hearing and can perform a more comprehensive hearing test and fit you with hearing aids if appropriate. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh, hearing aids… I've heard about those. Are they expensive? My pension doesn't stretch very far, you know. And I don't want anything too complicated, I get confused easily these days. An audiologist, you say? Is that someone else I have to see? Well, alright. If you think it’s best. I just want to be able to hear my grandkids when they visit, that’s all. It’s hard when you miss what they’re sayin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, hearing aids can be an investment, Betty, and I understand your concern about the cost. There are different levels of technology available, with varying price points. Many insurance plans, including Medicare, can help with the cost, and we can explore those options together. There are also some financing plans available. And you're right, some hearing aids can be quite complex, but there are also simpler models that are very easy to use. The audiologist will work with you to find the best option for your needs and lifestyle. They'll also teach you how to use and maintain them. An audiologist is a specialist in hearing loss, just like you see a cardiologist for your heart. They can do a much more detailed hearing test than I can and properly fit you with hearing aids if needed. I'll write you a referral now. They'll schedule an appointment for a full evaluation. Would you like me to provide you with a list of audiologists in the area?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. A list would be just wonderful. Anything to make it a little easier. And thank you for explainin' everything so patiently. It's a bit overwhelming, you know, all these new things. I'm an old woman, not used to fancy gadgets and doctors and tests! But… I suppose it’s worth a try, if it means I can hear my grandkids better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Betty. It is a lot to take in, and you’re very welcome. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Here's a list of local audiologists that take Medicare, along with their contact information. I’ve also included a brief description of their services. I’m also going to give you a handout about hearing loss and some tips for communicating with others. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, dear. Thank you so much for all your help. Let me see… Tips for communicating… that might be useful. I do tend to ask people to repeat themselves a lot! No, I think that’s all for now. You've answered all my questions. I appreciate your patience with an old woman like me. I guess I’ll be makin’ some phone calls now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. It was my pleasure. And please, don't apologize for asking questions! It's important to understand what's going on with your health. Remember, the audiologist is there to help you find the best solution for your needs. Don't hesitate to ask them any questions you have. If you have any trouble making an appointment or have any other concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before you leave?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that's all. I really do appreciate everything you’ve done. You’ve been a real comfort. I guess I’ll be gettin’ along then. Thank you again, and have a lovely day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a lovely day too, and I hope you can hear your grandkids a little bit clearer soon! .
