DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Though, frankly, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. I was told to come… something about stress. Honestly, the youth these days… can’t handle a bit of work. It’s all rather… unnecessary, but my ex-wife insisted. She’s… particular. Just get on with it, if you would.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, we can certainly get right to it. When you say "stress," can you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing that led your ex-wife to suggest you come in?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to articulate. It’s the students, you see. Utterly lacking in discipline. And the… the administrators! Always interfering with proper cataloging procedures. Honestly, it’s a mess. I’ve been… agitated, I suppose. Losing my patience. Though, I’ve always had a strong sense of order, so perhaps it’s just that things are… disorderly. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I’m not sure why I’m explaining this to you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the situation at work. Losing your patience and feeling agitated are certainly things we can explore. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about how you're feeling agitated?
PATIENT: Oh, it's quite obvious, really. I find myself… short-tempered. Snapping at colleagues. And I… well, I haven’t been sleeping properly. Not that I’m prone to weaknesses like needing a full eight hours, you understand. It's just... restless. I lie awake thinking about improperly shelved books. It's ludicrous, I know. But it occupies my mind. Are we getting somewhere with this, Doctor? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mr. Schlatterer. Difficulty sleeping and increased irritability are important to note. When you say “restless,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… a feeling of being unsettled. An inability to… relax. My thoughts race. Constantly cataloging, reorganizing… even when I’m trying to rest. It’s… bothersome. And frankly, I shouldn’t have to explain this. A sensible person would understand. It’s a professional hazard, really. Spending one’s life devoted to order. It takes its toll. Is there a point to all these questions, Doctor? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of functioning.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining this to me, Mr. Schlatterer. It is helpful. And it’s important to understand how things like dedication to your work can impact your well-being. Have you noticed any other changes recently, perhaps in your appetite, weight, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Appetite? Perfectly normal. I have a simple, sensible diet. No need for frivolous things. Weight… perhaps a slight decrease. But that’s likely due to the general state of the world, not some… emotional distress. And energy? Sufficient. Though, naturally, I am not a young man anymore. I do not require the boundless energy of these… undergraduates. Honestly, Doctor, are you attempting to diagnose me with some sort of… ailment? It’s rather insulting. I came here because I was told to, not because I believe I am ill.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m not attempting to diagnose you, simply gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. A slight weight decrease can sometimes be a sign of underlying stress, which is why I asked. Now, thinking about your past… have you ever experienced anything like this before – feeling agitated, difficulty sleeping, or changes in appetite?
PATIENT: My past? Good heavens. That's a rather… broad question. I’ve lived a full life, Doctor. A productive life. I dedicated myself to my profession. There were… challenges, naturally. Difficult students, incompetent administrators… the usual. As for experiencing this before… perhaps. Though, I’ve always dealt with it myself. A strong constitution, you see. I don’t believe in dwelling on such… trivial matters. My first wife… well, that was a different situation entirely. But I fail to see its relevance. Really, Doctor, are we making any progress here? I have important papers to grade. .
DOCTOR: I understand. We don’t need to delve into things you’re not comfortable with. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
