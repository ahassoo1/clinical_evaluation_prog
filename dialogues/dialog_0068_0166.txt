DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s…well, it’s been persistent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes I feel a bit of it in my right.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Numbness, you say. And it's been…how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think…it started, I believe, around the beginning of July. So, roughly a month now. At first, I didn’t pay it much mind, thinking it was just from sitting too long while working, but it hasn’t really gone away with changes in activity.
DOCTOR: A month… alright. And can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain precisely. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a shooting ache. It’s more of a…loss of feeling, a sort of…deadness. Sometimes it feels like my leg is slightly heavier than usual, too. It's not constant; it comes and goes. And it seems worse after I've been on my feet for a long period.
DOCTOR: Loss of feeling, heavier sensation…worse with activity. Does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: That's a good question. When I sit down and elevate it, it seems to help a little. And if I’m really focused on something—like my work, ironically—I sometimes don’t notice it as much. But nothing consistently makes it completely disappear, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so elevation helps somewhat, and distraction can lessen it. I see. Now, is this numbness accompanied by any weakness in the leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I can walk normally, climb stairs…do everything I usually do without any trouble. Though, now that you mention it, I have stumbled a couple of times recently, but I chalked that up to just being clumsy. Perhaps that’s related? I hadn’t really connected the two.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Stumbling… alright. Do you experience any pain in your back, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: That's…a good question. I sometimes get a bit of a dull ache in my lower back, but it’s not frequent, and I usually ignore it. It’s the kind of ache you get from sleeping in a weird position, honestly. Nothing debilitating. I don’t think it's directly related to the leg, but…well, you're the doctor. I could be wrong.
DOCTOR: Dull ache in the lower back… alright. And are you having any issues with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Oh. No, no issues there at all, thankfully. Everything’s…normal in that regard. That’s a bit of a personal question, isn't it? But I appreciate you asking, I suppose, to cover all bases. I’m not sure what those things would have to do with my leg, but… you’re right, better to be thorough.
DOCTOR: It is personal, yes, but important to rule things out. Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I get a regular check-up with my primary care physician, and he’s never mentioned anything concerning. No diabetes, no heart problems, no autoimmune disorders… nothing like that. I do have some seasonal allergies—pollen, mostly—but that’s about it. And I’m up-to-date on all my vaccinations.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and thankfully, no hospitalizations either. I broke my wrist when I was a child, about ten years old, and had to wear a cast for a few weeks, but that was the extent of it. Everything else has been minor—colds, flu, the occasional sprain—nothing that required anything serious. I try to be careful, you see. Working as an animator, you spend a lot of time in one position, so I try to stay active when I can.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, wrist fracture as a child… Alright. What about family history?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother has arthritis, in her hands and knees, mostly. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some issues with his back when he got older, but I don’t know the specifics. Nothing major that I’m aware of—no history of neurological disorders or anything like that. We’re a fairly healthy family overall, I believe. My Yupik ancestors were pretty hardy folk, you know. Spent a lot of time outdoors. Perhaps some of that resilience has carried over.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in mother, back issues in grandfather… And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I don't smoke, haven’t ever tried it. I very rarely drink alcohol—maybe a glass of wine at a special occasion, once or twice a year—and I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to take good care of my health, as I mentioned. It’s important for my work, you see. Requires a clear mind and steady hands. Plus, my community places a high value on well-being. It’s just…not something I'm interested in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kinjerski, that’s all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I understand that’s part of the process, and I trust your judgment. I'll do my best to remain still and cooperate with whatever you need. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie on your back on the examination table. I’m going to start with your reflexes. Just relax your legs. I’m going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might be a bit startling, but shouldn’t hurt. First, let’s start with your right leg. Good. And now your left. Okay, those seem…slightly diminished on the left side. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you please resist as I push down on your leg?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm lying down. I'm ready. I'll try to resist as best I can. It's a little difficult to tell how hard I’m pushing…should I say something if it feels too much?
DOCTOR: Yes, please tell me if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Okay, that seems…slightly weaker on the left side as well, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your leg with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes, please. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that… there. And now? Yes, I feel that one too… a little lower, on the shin. Hmm…it feels a bit…fuzzier, perhaps, lower down. Not completely numb, but not as sharp as on my right leg. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly diminished sensation distally on the left leg. Now let's examine your right leg for comparison. Good. Sensation is normal on the right. Now, I'm going to quickly test the skin on both of your legs for temperature differences. Okay, the temperature feels…slightly cooler on the left leg. It’s subtle, but noticeable. Alright, that concludes the physical exam for now.
PATIENT: Okay. Slightly cooler on the left… that's consistent with what I've been feeling, I suppose. It's not a dramatic difference, but it is there. So, what does all that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I apologize for being so direct, but it’s difficult not to worry when you don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings – the diminished reflexes, slightly weaker strength, reduced sensation, and cooler temperature on the left leg – it suggests some possible nerve compression or irritation in your lower back or leg. Now, this doesn’t automatically mean something serious, but we need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. Given your age and overall health, it's less likely to be something like a tumor, but we can't rule that out without more testing. The fact that it's been going on for a month is also something we need to address. I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a better look at the nerves and discs in your back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI…yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you recommend, then please do. I trust your professional judgment. I understand we need to rule things out, and a more detailed look seems prudent. Will the MRI require any preparation? And…approximately how long will it take to get the results? I have some work commitments I need to consider.
DOCTOR: Alright. The MRI shouldn't require any specific preparation – you can eat and drink normally beforehand. You’ll just need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, things like that. It will take approximately 30-45 minutes. As for results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the images and send the report to me. I'll review it as soon as I receive it and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Also, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage any discomfort. Do you have any allergies to these medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies to ibuprofen or naproxen, thankfully. Okay, so no strenuous activity, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. No problem. 24-48 hours for the results… that’s reasonable. And you'll contact me directly to schedule a follow-up? Doctor, is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any particular symptom that would warrant a more immediate visit? I don’t want to unnecessarily worry, but I prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. Please contact me immediately – or go to the nearest emergency room – if you experience any sudden weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe, unrelenting pain. These are rare, but serious symptoms that could indicate a more acute problem. Also, if the numbness spreads significantly or becomes accompanied by fever, please seek medical attention promptly. Otherwise, if it remains stable, waiting for the MRI results is appropriate. I'll make sure to schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. Sudden weakness, loss of control, severe pain, spreading numbness, fever… I’ve got that. Thank you for outlining those, Doctor. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll refrain from strenuous activity and monitor my symptoms closely. I look forward to hearing from you after the MRI. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. You're very welcome. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Take care. .
