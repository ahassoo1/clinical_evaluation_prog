DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly on my left. And… honestly, I seem to be getting a lot of water infections lately. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pain in your left side and frequent water infections, you say. “A while now” is a bit vague, could you be a little more specific about how long you’ve been experiencing these issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The pain… it comes and goes, you know? But I’d say the infections have been more regular for… maybe the last six months, at least. The pain… perhaps a year? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, Doctor. I don’t keep very good track of these things. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of more frequent infections, and about a year of intermittent pain. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s in my back, on my left side, just below my ribs. It sometimes goes around to my belly, but mostly it’s in my back. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you know? And it can be quite uncomfortable when it comes on.
DOCTOR: A dull ache in your left flank, radiating to the abdomen. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Nothing really makes it better, to be honest. Drinking lots of water sometimes helps a little, but it doesn't take it away completely. And worse… hmm. Sometimes if I’ve been doing a bit of gardening, bending over a lot, it feels worse afterwards. It’s just… a general ache, more noticeable when I've been active.
DOCTOR: Okay. And these water infections… have you been treated for them?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. My regular doctor – Dr. Sharma – has given me antibiotics a few times now. They seem to help clear it up, but it keeps coming back. That’s what’s worrying me, Doctor. It feels like I’m on a never-ending cycle of infections and pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent infections treated with antibiotics, recurring despite treatment. Let's talk about those antibiotics for a moment. Do you remember what you were prescribed each time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… not something I pay much attention to, to be honest. Dr. Sharma just gives me the prescription, and I take them. I usually just hand it to the pharmacist. I don’t recall the names, no. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Espinueva. We can look at your records to see what was prescribed. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the pain and infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I sometimes feel a bit tired, but I'm 69, you know? So that could just be age. No, nothing else really. No fever, no chills, no nausea… just the pain and the infections. And the tiredness, but I don’t think that’s related.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or nausea. Just pain, recurring infections and some fatigue. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Sharma told me… oh, it was a few years back now… that my kidneys weren't quite right. Something about lots of little sacs on them. He said it was something I’d have to live with, and just keep an eye on it. I think he called it… Polycystic Kidney Disease, was it? It’s a mouthful to say, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Polycystic Kidney Disease. That explains a few things. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never had any surgeries. I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat, to be honest. I try to avoid hospitals if I can. I just take what pills Dr. Sharma gives me and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he passed away quite young, from a heart attack. I don’t recall anyone else having any serious illnesses, to be honest. We weren't a very close family, so I didn’t really keep track of these things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your mother and a heart attack in your father. And what about your social history, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What do you mean? I live alone, always have. I don’t drink alcohol, never really liked it. And I don’t smoke. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been doing much of it lately with this pain. That’s about it, really. A quiet life, you could say.
DOCTOR: Alright. No alcohol, no smoking. Primarily a sedentary lifestyle currently. And finally, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I just take the pills Dr. Sharma gives me and hope for the best, as I said before. I’m a pretty simple man, really. I don’t take many risks.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… be gentle, please. I'm a bit of a delicate flower at my age. And… if it hurts, I’ll let you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s a bit tender. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. It’s right there… on my left side, a little bit below my ribs. Like a dull ache, you know? The same ache I get with the pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92, and your pulse is 82. Everything else seems within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like your recurring urinary infections and flank pain could be related to your Polycystic Kidney Disease. The cysts on your kidneys can sometimes become infected, causing pain and urinary symptoms. We need to investigate further to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a kidney function test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. A urine analysis and a kidney function test… yes, that’s fine. I trust your judgement. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It’s been going on for so long, and it’s starting to worry me. When can I expect the results? And… will they be painful?
DOCTOR: The tests are very straightforward, Mr. Espinueva. The urine analysis just requires a sample, and the kidney function test is a simple blood draw. Neither should be painful. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back to us. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to treat the current infection. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better, to prevent the infection from recurring. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics that you know of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. As I said before, I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything. I just take what Dr. Sharma gives me. So… any antibiotics should be fine, I suppose. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I'm prescribing Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice daily for seven days. And I’ll also give you a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – for further evaluation and management of your Polycystic Kidney Disease. It’s important to have a specialist monitor your condition long-term. My nurse will schedule that appointment for you. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A kidney specialist… yes, that sounds sensible too. I trust your judgement, Doctor. And… no, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for helping me understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Espinueva, I hope you feel better soon. My nurse will be in shortly to give you the prescription and schedule the appointment with the nephrologist. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
