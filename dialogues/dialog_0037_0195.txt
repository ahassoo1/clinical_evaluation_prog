DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you're 60 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, sixty. Though I don’t feel it, naturally. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. My daughter, she says I should get a little card. A “Get Well” card, or… something encouraging. From a real doctor, she insisted. I’m perfectly fine, you know. Not sick at all. Just… doing what she wants.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Janeth. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter, and I’m happy she encouraged you to come in. Even if you feel perfectly well, a check-up can be helpful. It sounds like she’s concerned about something. Can you tell me what specifically she's worried about?
PATIENT: Oh, she worries too much, that one. Always has. It’s… she saw me carrying a heavy bag of rice last week. Said I shouldn’t strain myself. Rice isn’t that heavy! I’ve been carrying rice for fifty years. She makes a big deal out of everything. Honestly, I think she just likes having an excuse to fuss over me. But she was very specific, insisted on a card from you. Is that really necessary? I mean, a perfectly healthy woman, needing a card…
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re very active and capable, Janeth. That’s wonderful. And it’s perfectly alright for your daughter to want to make sure you’re taking care of yourself. Even strong people benefit from a little check-in sometimes. And yes, a little documentation from me, as her preferred doctor, would put her mind at ease, it seems. Let's just do a quick assessment, then. I’ll ask a few questions about your overall health, and we can do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Brief, you say? Because I really don't have time for a long fuss. And I do have things to do, you know. I have a garden that needs weeding and… well, it doesn't matter. Just quick. And no poking and prodding if you can avoid it. Honestly, I’ve never understood all the poking and prodding doctors do. Is it absolutely necessary? And are you sure a card is all my daughter wants? She has a way of adding things on…
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. “Brief” is exactly what we’ll do. No unnecessary poking and prodding, I promise. I’ll just ask a few questions to get a sense of your overall health, and then maybe listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take long at all. And I can certainly document that you came in for a wellness check to reassure your daughter. To start, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh dear. Honestly, I don’t really have a medical history. I’ve been remarkably healthy my whole life. A few colds, naturally. And I pulled a muscle once, lifting a… well, never mind. Mostly, I just eat good food, work hard, and get on with things. I don't go to doctors unless absolutely forced. My mother always said doctors cause more problems than they solve. And she was a very sensible woman. Is this absolutely necessary? Asking about history?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Janeth. It’s always best to be proactive about staying healthy. And your mother sounds like a wise woman. Knowing you’ve been healthy is very helpful information. Just to be thorough, even with a good history, it's helpful to ask a few standard questions. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. Not a single one. Maybe a bad stomach ache once, but that was just something I ate. I told you, I’ve been remarkably healthy. It’s frustrating that you’re asking all these questions when I’m perfectly fine. Are all doctors like this? So many questions for a woman who just wants a card! It's a bit demeaning, honestly. Is there anything you can tell me, instead of asking me? Something about cards, perhaps?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m causing any frustration, Janeth. I assure you, I’m not trying to demean you. The questions are just a standard part of a check-up, even for healthy individuals. It’s helpful to have a complete picture, so I can document everything accurately for your daughter’s peace of mind, and have a baseline if anything were to change in the future. As for the card, I can certainly write a note stating that you came in for a wellness check today, and that I found you to be in good health, with no immediate concerns. Would that be satisfactory?
PATIENT: “No immediate concerns.” Yes, that sounds… acceptable. As long as it’s clear I’m perfectly fine. And perhaps you could mention I carry heavy bags of rice regularly, to demonstrate my… vigor? She thinks I’m frail, you see. It's very insulting. And… is there a specific type of card she requested? A cheerful one? A dramatic one? She has very strong opinions on these things. Honestly, this is more trouble than it's worth. But I promised her.
DOCTOR: “No immediate concerns” and a note about your regular rice-carrying… certainly. I'll be sure to include that. As for the card, she didn't specify a particular type of card, just that it come from a doctor. We have some generic “get well” cards here with cheerful images, or I can simply write a note on a blank card. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Blank card. Definitely blank. The cheerful images… they’re undignified. And they imply I need cheering up! Just a simple note, stating I’m in good health, carry rice regularly, and that I am perfectly capable. And perhaps a sentence about my sensible mother? She’d be very pleased. Honestly, I think she’d find the whole thing rather amusing. But do hurry. My garden is calling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. A blank card with a note stating you are in excellent health, regularly carry rice, and are perfectly capable. I’ll also include a sentence about your sensible mother. One moment… Alright, here's what I’ve written: “Janeth Micucci presented for wellness check on August 2, 2025. Patient reports excellent health, with no current complaints. Patient regularly carries heavy bags of rice, demonstrating excellent physical capability. Patient’s mother was noted to be a sensible woman. No immediate concerns.” Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: “Excellent physical capability.” That’s good. Very good. And mentioning my mother… yes. That’s exactly what she’d want. “No immediate concerns” is crucial. You haven’t said anything about my garden, though. Perhaps a brief acknowledgement of my horticultural pursuits? It demonstrates… balance. A balance between physical and mental wellbeing. But… alright. It’s good enough. As long as my daughter is satisfied. Can we be done now? I really must get back to my weeding.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Janeth. A complete picture is important. I’ve added a sentence about your dedication to gardening. Here’s the revised note: “Janeth Micucci presented for wellness check on August 2, 2025. Patient reports excellent health, with no current complaints. Patient regularly carries heavy bags of rice, demonstrating excellent physical capability. Patient’s mother was noted to be a sensible woman. Patient maintains an active garden, demonstrating a healthy balance of physical and mental wellbeing. No immediate concerns.” Is that to your liking?
PATIENT: “Healthy balance…” Yes, that’s much better. Very good. You’ve captured the essence of it perfectly. Yes, that will do nicely. Finally. Now, can I have the card? And perhaps a little something to show my daughter I’m not completely dismissing her concerns? A small sticker, maybe? Something floral? Honestly, she’ll fuss if there’s nothing else.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. Here's the blank card. And here’s a floral sticker, just to show your daughter you appreciate her thoughtfulness. I’ll document everything in your chart, and you’re free to go whenever you’re ready. It was lovely meeting you, and I'm glad we could reassure your daughter. If anything changes, or if you do have any concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to come back.
PATIENT: Yes, well. Thank you, I suppose. Though I doubt I’ll be back. I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, you see. And this… this was just for my daughter. She’ll be pleased with the sticker. She always appreciates a thoughtful touch. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I really must get back to my garden. It won’t weed itself, you know. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Have a wonderful day, Janeth. And enjoy your garden! .
