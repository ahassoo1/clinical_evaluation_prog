DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this sleepiness, really. Even with the machine, I’m just…tired all the time during the day. It's a bit of a bother, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness even with the machine… that's definitely something we need to look into. When you say “the machine,” are you referring to a CPAP machine for sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. The CPAP. Been using it for…oh, let me think…almost ten years now, I believe. Doctor Ramirez, he set me up with it. Good man, Doctor Ramirez. Moved away, though.
DOCTOR: Right, a CPAP for ten years. That's good that you've been consistent with it. It's not uncommon for things to change over time, even with a machine you've used for a while. So, this tiredness… has it been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It wasn’t like flipping a switch. More like…the feeling just slowly crept back. At first, I didn’t really notice it, just figured I was getting older, you know? But it’s gotten to the point where I have to really push myself to get through the afternoons. I used to enjoy puttering in the garden, but now…I nap more than I garden.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating, especially when it’s impacting things you enjoy. And it’s good you’re recognizing the change and coming in to see me. When you say you have to "push yourself," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well…it’s a heaviness, really. Not a physical heaviness, although sometimes my muscles ache a bit. It's more like…my brain is wading through molasses. Hard to concentrate, you know? I find myself rereading things, forgetting what I was about to say mid-sentence. And I just feel…unmotivated, even for things I usually like. It makes teaching a bit difficult, I won’t lie.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a significant change. “Wading through molasses” is a good way to put it. And the difficulty with concentration is concerning. You mentioned teaching – are you still teaching?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. At the community college. Mostly history and a bit of cultural studies. I've been doing it…oh, goodness…almost forty years now. I enjoy it, truly. But these little lapses…they worry me. I don’t want to be a bad teacher. Especially with the students…I want to be sharp for them.
DOCTOR: That's admirable, wanting to be sharp for your students after forty years of teaching. It's good you're aware of these changes and concerned about the impact on your work. Let's talk a bit about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… my appetite hasn’t really changed, no. I eat about the same. But…my weight has crept up a bit. Not a lot, but enough to be noticeable in my clothes. Maybe five or ten pounds, I’d guess. It's harder to stay active, with this tiredness, you see. Less gardening, more napping…it all adds up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight weight gain with the reduced activity. That's helpful to know. And you’ve been using the CPAP consistently all this time?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. Every night. Well…almost every night. There have been a couple of times, on trips, where I forgot it, or…I just didn’t want to bother with it. But 95% of the time, it's on. I know I should use it every single night, and I usually do. I just don’t want to lie about the few times I haven’t.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Paske. It’s important to have a complete picture. Even occasional breaks in CPAP use can have an impact. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any snoring, even with the CPAP machine on?
PATIENT: That's…a good question. My wife…well, my ex-wife, she always complained about my snoring. Before the machine, of course. With the machine on…I honestly don’t know. I haven’t asked anyone. I sleep alone now, you see. It's just me and the machine. I suppose it's possible, though. It wouldn't surprise me.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Paske. That’s helpful information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask about any other medical conditions you might have. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let's see…High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about fifteen years ago. I take medication for it, and it's generally well-controlled. Diabetes…no, never had that. And heart problems…the doctor did some tests a few years back, said my heart was a little enlarged, but nothing to worry about at the time. He put me on a low-salt diet. Does that make sense? It all feels like a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a slightly enlarged heart noted in the past. Low-salt diet is good. Just a few more questions regarding your medications. Can you tell me the names of all the medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let's see… for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a baby aspirin every morning, just as the doctor recommended. Oh, and sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take Ibuprofen. Nothing else, really. Just those three. And a multivitamin, but that doesn’t really count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a multivitamin doesn't really count. So, Lisinopril 20mg daily, baby aspirin daily, and Ibuprofen as needed. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Go ahead. I suppose I should have asked what you were going to do during the exam, but I figured you knew what you were doing. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you, Mr. Paske. I appreciate your trust. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds a little bit…irregular, and I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear, though. Next, I'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 145/85 today, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 78 and irregular. I’m also going to check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal. Finally, I’ll take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks fine, and your ears are clear. I’m going to note all of these findings in your chart.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Irregular heartbeat, elevated blood pressure…that doesn’t sound good, does it? I’ve never really paid much attention to those things, honestly. I just take the pills the doctor tells me to take and hope for the best. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions, Mr. Paske. The irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia, and the elevated blood pressure do warrant further investigation. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but we need to figure out the cause. Several things could be contributing to this. Your age, the long-standing high blood pressure, and even the sleep apnea itself can play a role. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities, such as thyroid issues, although that initial exam didn't indicate anything concerning there. I'm going to order a few tests. First, an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to get a more detailed reading of your heart's electrical activity. I also want to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, which will give us information about your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. Finally, I'd like to check your thyroid levels again, just to be sure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Tests are good. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. EKG, blood panel, and another thyroid check… alright. Just tell me what I need to do. Where do I go for these tests? And… will my insurance cover them? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s the right attitude, Mr. Paske. It's always best to be proactive. You’ll go to the lab here in the clinic for the blood panel and the EKG. The receptionist will schedule those appointments for you right after this consultation. They’ll also verify your Medicare coverage. You shouldn’t have any issues, but they’ll confirm the costs and any potential copays. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll need a sample of your blood for the panel and will attach some sensors to your chest for the EKG. Both tests are relatively quick and painless. I’ll also send an order for a repeat thyroid test to the same lab. They can likely draw the extra sample at the same time as the other tests. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…very organized. Lab down the hall, one visit for everything… that’s good. Alright. I’ll go see the receptionist now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little bit. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care.
