DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner, I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, right. This swelling. It’s mostly my face, you see, and my legs are… puffy. Been happenin’ for a bit now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Time kinda slips away when you’re on your own, you know? It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Uncomfortable," alright. And when you say 'a bit now,' could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe a couple of weeks? Could be longer. Honestly, doc, I don't keep track of these things. It just sort of… appeared. Not somethin' a man worries about unless it starts botherin' him, and it is botherin' me now. It makes it hard to get my glasses on, see?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll figure it out. Has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Same routine, same everything. I go to work, I come home, I… well, I mostly just sit. Used to go fishin’ with my wife, bless her heart, but… that was a while back. Ain't been much change in the diet either. Meat and potatoes, mostly. Simple stuff. Don't go for fancy foods. It just is, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant… mostly. It's worse in the mornin', I think. Like when I wake up, my face feels like a balloon. Gets a little better as the day goes on, but it never really goes away completely. Sometimes my ankles get real bad too, especially after I've been on my feet at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned work. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Welding, mostly. And solderin', braizin’… all that. I set up the machines, you see, make sure they're runnin' right. Been doin' it for… a long time now. It's hot work, but a man's gotta earn a livin', right? It ain't easy on the body, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look at those ankles. Could you please sit on the examination table and extend your legs?
PATIENT: There ya go. Old bones ain't as nimble as they used to be. Just let me know if you need me to move 'em around. Hope they ain't too bad.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's definite pitting edema in both ankles. And your skin is somewhat discolored, a bit… brownish. Do you have any history of diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Kidney problems? No, not that I know of. Never been told nothin' like that. Doctors didn't bother much with us workin' men back in my day, long as you could still do the job. I mean, I get tired, but that's just from the work, right? I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… not really. Took some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. Never had a bad reaction to nothin’ that I recall. And I don't take nothin' regularly. I'm a simple man, doc. Don't need a lot of fancy pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Can you roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There ya go. Hope this ain't gonna take too long. I got things to do, you know. Not one for sittin' around.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated... 160 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but you’re breathing a little heavily. Alright. We're going to need to do some blood work and a urine sample. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up. Do you have any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? No, not really. It's… normal. A little slow sometimes, now that I think about it, but nothing to worry about. Old age, you know. Everything slows down eventually. Just get it done, doc. Let's figure out what's goin' on. I ain't one for complainin', but this swelling's gettin' old.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be right in. In the meantime, try to relax. We’ll get this sorted out. .
PATIENT: .
