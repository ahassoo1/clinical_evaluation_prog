DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 67 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's this…stuff. Coming back up. Food, mostly. Happens a couple times a week. It's unpleasant, you understand. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: “Very unpleasant,” I understand. Alright. So, you're experiencing regurgitation – food coming back up – a couple of times a week. Can you describe what this “stuff” looks like?
PATIENT: Regurgitation? Is that what they're calling it now? It's…food, Doctor. What does it look like? Like the food I ate. Half-digested, usually. Sometimes it's just…salty. And it burns, going back up. Honestly, it's quite undignified. I don’t understand why you need to know exactly what it looks like. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to be precise with medical terminology, Mr. Altine, and describing the emesis—that's the medical term for vomiting, which is what I believe you’re experiencing—helps me to understand the potential cause. "Salty" is…an interesting descriptor. Does it happen after specific meals, or is it random?
PATIENT: Emesis? Really? Look, I'm a practical man. Emergency Management, you know. I deal with real problems. Not fancy words. And it’s not always after a meal. Sometimes it’s hours later. Sometimes when I lie down. It’s unpredictable, which is the frustrating part. Honestly, it’s probably just age. Things wear out, don’t they? Is there anything you can do about it? Because if it's just age, I'm not sure what the point of all this questioning is.
DOCTOR: While the body does undergo changes with age, Mr. Altine, unpredictable emesis—particularly if it occurs hours after eating—warrants investigation. It's not simply a matter of "things wearing out." I need to gather a more complete history to determine the potential cause. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I eat like a horse, always have. My wife tells me I eat too much, actually. I'm a big man, need my sustenance. 197 centimeters, you know. And a healthy weight for my height. Though, I suppose I've lost a little around the middle, but that’s just…life, isn't it? Not from not eating. I assure you. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any heartburn or indigestion alongside this emesis?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Sometimes. A bit of a burning feeling in my chest. Not constantly, but when this…stuff comes up, it's usually accompanied by it. It’s…uncomfortable. Like a fire. And I take those antacids, the ones you get over the counter. They help a little, but not always. Frankly, they taste awful. Are we done here soon? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or a feeling of food getting stuck in your throat?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Food goes down just fine. It's what comes up that's the problem, Doctor. Not what goes down. I swear, you’re asking me about everything but the actual issue. Is this some kind of test? Are you trying to see if I'm paying attention? Look, I run emergency situations. I can handle a little…regurgitation. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I assure you this is not a test. I need a comprehensive understanding of your symptoms to determine the appropriate course of action. Difficulty swallowing would be a key indicator, yes, but its absence doesn't rule out potential causes. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting before meals, or only afterward?
PATIENT: Only afterward, usually. Sometimes it happens in the middle of the night, which is particularly… aggravating. I don't feel sick to my stomach beforehand. It just… happens. It’s like a switch flips. Look, are you going to give me something for this or not? I don’t have time for a drawn-out investigation. My wife makes a lovely goulash, but it’s not worth this. It’s a good goulash, but…you understand. Honestly, the whole thing is just… inconvenient. Can we just try something? Anything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your frustration, but prescribing medication without a proper assessment would be irresponsible. It’s possible this is a relatively minor issue, but it could also indicate a more serious underlying condition. I need to rule out things like esophageal issues or even a motility disorder. I would like to perform a quick physical exam, listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us determine the best course of action. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A motility disorder? Honestly. Fine, do your exam. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just…age. And make it quick. I have a very important meeting. And please, no more fancy words. Just tell me what you’re doing as you do it. Don't want any surprises. My time is valuable, Doctor. Very valuable. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me assess any unusual sounds or tenderness. I’ll start here, on your right side… Take a deep breath for me, please.
PATIENT: There. Done. Just hurry it up, alright? And be gentle. I don’t want to pull a muscle. Honestly, I haven't lied down on one of these things in years. It's…undignified. And cold. Is that what you call it…auscultating? Sounds like something they do to horses. Just get it over with. I have a meeting, remember? A very important one. I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I will let you know if I feel anything of concern. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes, a little. There, on the left side. Not a sharp pain, but…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. You’re pressing on something. Honestly, I don't appreciate being poked and prodded. This is becoming rather unpleasant. And if you find something, just tell me straight. No need for fancy medical jargon. Is it serious? Is it…age? Just get to the point. My meeting…
DOCTOR: Alright. I felt some mild tenderness in your left flank, but no obvious masses. This could be indicative of several things – muscular strain, perhaps, or referred pain from another area. It’s not necessarily serious, but it warrants further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an upper endoscopy to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The endoscopy will allow us to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum directly.
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You’re going to put a camera down my throat? Absolutely not. No. I refuse. I’ve heard stories. It sounds barbaric. This is ridiculous. I came in here for a little regurgitation, and now you want to shove a camera down my throat? No way. I’m leaving. This is a waste of my time. A complete waste. I’ll just… deal with it. I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. Goodbye, Doctor. And frankly, I think you need to reconsider your approach. A little common sense would go a long way. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your apprehension, but the endoscopy is the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out potentially serious conditions. Refusing it could have consequences. However, I respect your autonomy. I will document your refusal in your chart, and I strongly recommend that you consult with another physician for a second opinion. Here is a referral to a gastroenterologist in the area. They may be able to offer alternative diagnostic options. Please, take care of yourself. .
