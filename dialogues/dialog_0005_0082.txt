DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, travel. I need… something for travel. My wife… she liked to go places. Now I go. Need… shots, maybe? I don’t really know what I need. It’s… a long story.
DOCTOR: Right. Travel. Okay. Well, “shots” as you put it, is a good place to start. It depends where you're traveling, exactly. And how long you'll be gone. Some places require certain vaccinations to even get in. And others just have risks you should be aware of. So, first things first – where are you planning on going?
PATIENT: Hmm… it was her dream. Nepal. But… not that Nepal. I live in Nepal. She wanted to go to… India. Yeah, India. For… a month? Maybe six weeks. I don’t keep track so well since… well. It’s far, right? Lots of… bugs? She read something about getting sick. That’s why I’m here. Probably.
DOCTOR: India, alright. And you're currently in Nepal… that's... helpful to know. Yes, India has its risks. A lot depends on where in India you'll be going. Big country. Rural areas, cities... it all makes a difference. Okay. So, you’re concerned about getting sick. That's sensible. We need to figure out what vaccinations you may be missing, and talk about preventative measures. Have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… I had some when I got the job. At the airplane place. But… that was a long time ago. Before… everything. They poked me a lot. But I don’t remember what they gave me. Yellow card? I think I had a yellow card. Maybe it’s at home. It’s small, yellow… with writing. Do you need it?
DOCTOR: A yellow card… that’s the International Certificate of Vaccination, yes. It would be helpful if you could bring that in when you have a chance. It tells us what you've already received. But don't worry if you can’t find it right away. We can go through everything systematically. Do you remember anything about what those vaccinations were for?
PATIENT: Uh… airplane stuff. They said… germs. Things you catch from other people. Something about… flying. And… heat? I work outside a lot. Building the planes. I get a lot of sun. Does sun count? It burns. And… I think one was for… water? Dirty water. That sounds right. She said India has a lot of dirty water. I don’t remember the names. Just… things.
DOCTOR: Right. “Things.” Well, that narrows it down. The airplane place likely gave you some routine travel vaccinations – things like Hepatitis A and Typhoid, potentially, given your mention of water. And possibly some boosters for things like Tetanus. Okay. Let’s do this the proper way. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… uh. I get headaches sometimes. From the sun, maybe. And my back hurts when I lift heavy things. That’s normal, right? Building airplanes is hard work. Apart from that… no. She took care of everything. She made the appointments. She knew all the… words. I just… went. Everything is a little fuzzy now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Headaches and back pain… alright. We'll document that. It's important to be thorough. "Fuzzy" isn't very helpful, Mr. Tayar. I need you to try and recall. Any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious…? I had… the flu, I think, once. A long time ago. Before the job. She gave me… tea. And I slept. That’s all. I… I don’t get sick much. I’m strong. I have to be. For the work. She always said I was… tough. It's hard to remember things now, okay? It feels like a long time ago. Everything just… blends together.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Look, I understand things are difficult. But I need accurate information to ensure your safety. Any hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hospital… no. Never. She… she always fixed everything. Cuts, burns, bad headaches… she had… creams, and bandages, and pills. She was a nurse, you see? A very good nurse. Before… everything. I just… got better. She wouldn’t let me go to the hospital. She said… they don't understand our ways. It was better to stay home. Does that make sense? I haven’t seen a doctor in… a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No hospitalizations, primarily managed by your wife with… home remedies. We’ll document that as well. It is… unconventional, but I'll make a note of it. Now, let's talk about family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – have any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family…? My parents… they are gone now. Both of them. A long time ago. I don’t remember… much about them. They were farmers. In the mountains. I think my mother… she had a bad heart, maybe? She was always tired. But I was young. I didn’t pay attention. And I don't have any siblings. Just… me. She didn’t talk about family much. It was… better to focus on the present. On work. On getting things done. Sorry. It’s… difficult to think about.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history known. We’ll note that. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Never. She said… pills are bad for you. She made me… teas. And… herbal remedies. For everything. Headaches, back pain, when I caught a cold… teas. Lots of teas. She knew what was good for me. She didn’t believe in… modern medicine. She said it… weakens your body. I haven’t taken a pill in… a very long time. Sorry. I know it’s probably not helpful. I just… don't take pills.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Primarily managed by herbal remedies. We’ll document all of this. Now, this is important: do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don’t… think so. I’ve never really… reacted to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, from the sun. But that’s not an allergy, right? She used some… plants for my skin, to protect me from the sun. She knew what was good for me. I… I haven't had a bad reaction to anything. I don't think so. Sorry. It’s… hard to remember. Everything is a bit… blurred.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. We’ll note that. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke…? No. Never. She wouldn't allow it. Said it was bad for your lungs. And… bad for the air. She was very careful about… everything. Keeping things clean. Healthy. I… I don't smoke. She made sure of that. Sorry. It’s… a long story.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? Sometimes. With my friends. Local stuff. Rice wine, mostly. Not… a lot. Just… to celebrate. Or… when we're sad. It’s… how we do things. She… she didn't like it when I drank. Said it weakens your spirit. But… sometimes it helps. Just a little. Sorry. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s… part of our culture.
DOCTOR: Right. Occasional alcohol use. And… how often would you say you drink, Mr. Tayar?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe once or twice a month? When we get together. It’s… not every week. Not like… some people. Just… to relax. After work. With my friends. It’s… important to have friends. She… she didn’t really understand. She was always working. Taking care of everyone else. Sorry. It’s… hard to explain. It’s… social. It’s… what we do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional social alcohol use. Now, this is very important. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational…? No! Never! She… she would never allow it. She said it destroys your life. Ruins your body. I… I don’t do those things. It’s… bad. Very bad. She made sure of that. Sorry. I… I don’t even know what you mean. She… she taught me to be a good man. A strong man. And that means… staying away from those things. Never. Absolutely never. Sorry. It’s… terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recreational drug use. Okay. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Physical…? Uh… I guess so. She… she always did it. Checked my heartbeat. Listened to my lungs. She said it was important. But… I don’t really like being touched. Sorry. Is it… necessary? I’m… a little nervous. She… she was very gentle. I hope you… you will be too.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Tayar. It helps me assess your overall health and ensure you are fit for travel. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Just relax your arm for me… good. Blood pressure is 130 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay… She… she always said my stomach was strong. From the tea. Lots of tea. It’s… feels a little cold. Is that normal? I… I don’t really like this. It makes me… uncomfortable. Sorry. I just… want to get this over with. It’s… stressful. She… she always knew what to do. She… she would explain everything. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Normal bowel sounds. Your temperature is slightly low, which could be normal, but we'll keep an eye on it. Throat is clear. Ears are normal. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure is something to monitor. We can discuss lifestyle changes to help lower it. And it’s concerning that you have not seen a doctor in a long time. We really need to run some blood work to get a more accurate picture of your health. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Blood work…? Uh… She… she didn't like blood work. Said it… weakens you. It takes too much from your body. But… if you think it’s necessary… I guess so. I just… I don’t want to feel sick. I need to go to India. It was her dream. I need to… make it happen. If blood work will help… I’ll do it. But… please be quick. And… gentle. Sorry. I just… I don’t like needles. She… she always held my hand. Is that okay? Can someone… hold my hand?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll do a basic blood panel – complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function tests. It will give us a good baseline. And yes, a nurse can hold your hand if you'd like. I understand you're anxious. Mr. Tayar, I need to be frank with you. It’s concerning that you've gone so long without proper medical care. You're planning a trip to India, which carries certain health risks. We need to address these risks proactively. Ignoring your health now could have serious consequences. I'm recommending a full physical and blood work. Are you willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Full physical…? Uh… I guess so. If you think it’s… really necessary. I just… I don’t want to cause any trouble. I just want to go to India. For her. But… I don’t want to be sick. I need to be strong. If a full physical will help me… be strong… then yes. I’ll do it. But… please be quick. And… gentle. And… maybe someone can hold my hand? Sorry. I just… I’m scared. She… she always told me everything would be okay. Now… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll schedule you for a full physical, including blood work. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the process. I understand your anxiety, and we will do everything we can to make you comfortable. I’ll also provide you with a list of vaccinations you should consider based on your travel itinerary. Mr. Tayar, I'm also recommending a tetanus booster, if you haven't had one within the last ten years. It’s crucial for preventing infection, especially in a country like India. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Tetanus…? Uh… I don’t… remember. She… she always kept track of those things. The yellow card… I think. But I don’t have it with me. If you think it’s… important… then yes. Do it. Just… please be quick. And… gentle. I just… I want this to be over with. So I can go to India. For her. Sorry. I just… I’m a little tired now. And… scared. Is someone going to hold my hand? Please?
DOCTOR: Alright. A nurse will administer a tetanus booster along with the blood work. And yes, she will be happy to hold your hand, Mr. Tayar. I will also print out some information about travel health risks specific to India, and a list of recommended vaccinations. Please read it carefully. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your blood work results and finalize your travel vaccinations. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For… everything. I just… I want to go to India. For her. Sorry. I just… I'm a little overwhelmed. Is someone coming soon? To… hold my hand? And… do the things? Thank you. I just… want this to be over with. Sorry.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly, Mr. Tayar. Please just try to relax.
PATIENT: .
