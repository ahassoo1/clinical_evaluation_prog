DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Dr. Mutnick. I see you’re eighty-three years of age. Please, tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-three, yes, though I feel younger most days. Well, it's this tiredness. Daytime tiredness, mostly. I've been using one of those machines at night, you know, the one that blows air? It helps me breathe, I think... but I'm still dragging all day. It's just... wearing me down.
DOCTOR: A machine... you mean a CPAP?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! A CPAP. My wife – well, my ex-wife, it's been a while – she was the one who got me set up with it. Said I snored something awful and stopped breathing sometimes. She was probably right, she always was good at noticing things. But even with the machine, I'm still sleepy during the day. It’s frustrating, you know? I want to be able to enjoy my retirement, but I’m just too tired to do much.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been using this CPAP machine, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… about four years now, maybe a little more. Four years, two months, I believe. They had me do a sleep study at the hospital, and that's when they said I had sleep apnea. So they got me the machine, showed me how to use it, and… well, here we are. I try to use it every night, I really do. It's just… sometimes it's a bit uncomfortable. And I don't always remember if I actually had it on all night. Though I thought that’s what this visit was for, to see if it was working right?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We'll get to that. Let's establish a bit of a history, if you don't mind. Besides the daytime tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little forgetful sometimes, but at my age, isn't that to be expected? My daughter jokes I’ve been losing my mind for decades. Ha! But honestly, no headaches, no… I don't think so. Just tired. Very tired. And a bit grumpy because of it, I suppose. My old bones ache a little, but that’s just getting old. It’s mostly just the sleepiness, Doctor. It makes everything harder.
DOCTOR: Right. Any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was a scare. And I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Oh, and my blood pressure's been a little high for a while, but the doctor put me on a pill for that. I take it every day. Nothing major, nothing that’s bothered me for long. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I always ate well, that’s what my mother always said. Good food, good living, that's the secret. Though it doesn’t seem to be helping me sleep!
DOCTOR: And what medication are you taking for the blood pressure, precisely?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s a little white pill… Lisinopril, that's it! Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day, in the morning. I get the refills automatically from the pharmacy, so I don’t have to worry about it. My daughter handles most of that for me, bless her heart. She’s a very organized girl. And she always reminds me to take my pills, which is a good thing, because sometimes I forget! Though that's just the age, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a kid, but that's not a medication, is it? My wife – again, my ex-wife – she always said I had a strong constitution. I guess that’s why I’ve lasted this long. No, no allergies to pills or anything like that, Doctor. I've taken all sorts over the years and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, family history. Any significant illnesses run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My father… he had heart trouble towards the end of his life, that's what I remember. He smoked too much, though. Terrible habit. And my mother… she had diabetes, I think. Or maybe it was high blood pressure. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't paying much attention to medical things back then. My brother, he was healthy as a horse, never had a day’s illness in his life. He was a farmer, you know, always outdoors. So, heart trouble on my father’s side, maybe diabetes on my mother’s. That’s about all I can recall, honestly. It wasn’t something we talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: And socially… Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. Very occasionally. I used to enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner, back when my wife was still around. But I don’t really drink anymore. Not since… well, not since she passed. Maybe a small glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s about it. It doesn’t really appeal to me much these days. I find a cup of tea much more satisfying, to be honest. And it doesn’t make me sleepy! Though, clearly, something is making me sleepy. It’s just… hard to figure out what.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s perform a brief physical exam, Mr. Paske. Nothing extensive, but I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Getting up and down isn't as easy as it used to be, but I can manage. This table looks a bit high, but I'm sure we'll manage. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, please. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are somewhat reduced. Blood pressure is 140/90. Elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Your blood pressure is a little high, Mr. Paske, but otherwise, the exam is unremarkable. Do you feel any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Well, that doesn’t sound very good, does it? High blood pressure… I thought the pill was supposed to fix that. As for swelling… hmm… Not much, I don't think. Maybe a little bit around the ankles, but I’ve always had rather thick ankles, so it’s hard to tell. It’s probably just the age. Everything’s swelling these days! But no, nothing unusual, nothing that’s bothered me. It’s not like they’re puffed up like balloons or anything. Mostly, I just feel tired. Is the tiredness something to do with the blood pressure, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Mr. Paske, but unlikely to be the sole cause. Given your history and the persistent tiredness, despite CPAP use, I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We need to rule out other potential causes, such as anemia or thyroid issues. Do you have any objections to a simple blood draw?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. I’ve had plenty of blood work done over the years, so I'm used to it. As long as it helps figure out why I’m so tired, I’m happy to do it. Just let me know when and where. And try not to take too much, if you can. I always feel a bit weak afterwards. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for twelve hours before the blood draw. No food or drink, other than water. The lab slip will have detailed instructions. I'll have my nurse schedule the appointment for you. We will also need to review your CPAP data to ensure it’s functioning optimally. Do you have access to the machine’s reports, or does your sleep clinic manage that remotely?
PATIENT: Oh, the sleep clinic manages everything remotely. They send me emails sometimes, telling me how well I'm doing... or not doing, I suppose. They can see all the data, pressure levels, how long I’ve been using it… everything. I don't really understand all the numbers, to be honest. I just know if they tell me to adjust the mask or something. They said I was using it enough, but still feeling tired. That’s why I came to see you, Doctor. They suggested I get a check-up. So, they have all the data, if that helps. I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will contact your sleep clinic directly to request the CPAP data. In the meantime, please continue using the machine as prescribed. Once we have the blood work results and the CPAP data, we can formulate a more comprehensive plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's frustrating feeling so tired all the time, and it's good to know someone is trying to figure it out. I suppose all we can do is wait for the results now. And try to get some rest, though that’s easier said than done. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the blood work. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we will proceed from there. That will be all for today, Mr. Paske. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
