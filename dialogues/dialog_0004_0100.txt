DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's...well, they said I needed to get this done. A check-up, I think? Something about needing a drug test. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. My late husband used to handle all this stuff. It’s just...routine, right? For work?
DOCTOR: Routine, yes, in a sense. But it's important to understand why your employer requires this. It’s not simply a formality. Are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I am. I… operate those big machines. You know, for the roads? Paving and all that. It’s a good job, keeps me busy. Been doing it a long time, even before…well, never mind. Is that what this test is about? Making sure I can still…operate safely? I think so. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Medicare sent me the paperwork, so it must be important.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you operate heavy machinery for road construction. That does explain the requirement, then. And Medicare is simply billing for the visit. It’s standard practice for roles with safety-sensitive responsibilities to undergo regular drug screenings. To clarify, are you experiencing any difficulties with your work currently?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I’m a bit slower than I used to be, naturally. Fifty-one years will do that to a person! And sometimes I get…distracted. Thinking about things. But nothing that would, you know, cause a problem. I think. I really don’t remember anything specific. Is this test looking for something in particular? I don’t… do anything, if that makes sense. Not anymore, anyway.
DOCTOR: “Not anymore”?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. That came out wrong. My late husband… he had some health problems. And, well, sometimes he needed… medication. Strong stuff. I used to help him with it. A long time ago, though. Decades. I haven’t touched anything like that since he passed. It’s just…old memories, I suppose. I’m rambling, aren’t I? It has nothing to do with me, now. I promise. Just… trying to be helpful. It’s just what I do. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re clarifying that you haven't used any substances yourself for a significant period, but your late husband did?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s it. He… needed things for the pain, you see. And I helped him manage it. It was a long time ago, though. Really. Decades. And I haven't touched anything since he… well, you know. Just wanted to be clear. Is that what this test is looking for? Things from… back then? I wouldn’t know what to tell you, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It's all very confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, the drug screening isn't specifically about past use, although that can sometimes be a factor. It’s to ensure you're currently fit to operate heavy machinery safely. However, your honesty about your husband’s past medication is important. We’ll need to take a thorough medical history. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. Doctor Miller prescribed it, a few years back. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, you buy it at the drugstore. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. That’s it, I think. Really. Nothing else comes to mind. I really try to keep things simple, you see. Makes life easier. Is that enough information? I'm so sorry if I'm being a bother. I just want to get this done and over with.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being a bother. It's important to be thorough. Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D. Very good. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and perhaps a quick neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need. A physical exam sounds fine. I haven’t had one in… well, it’s been a while. My late husband always handled all that. But I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if anything… hurts. I'm not as young as I used to be, you see. And sometimes my joints ache. But other than that, I’m alright. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I just want to get this done and go home, if you don't mind. It’s a beautiful day outside.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you'll just have a seat here. We’ll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out.
PATIENT: Alright, deep breaths. In… and out… in… and out… It feels a little strange, after so long. My late husband used to say I always breathed too fast. Said I was always worrying about something. He was probably right. Is everything alright? It doesn't hurt, but it feels… unusual. I haven’t been to a doctor in ages, as I mentioned. Just hoping everything’s okay. Is my blood pressure too high? It's probably the stress of all this, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Your breathing is a little shallow, and I detect a slight wheeze in your lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. Blood pressure is elevated, as you suspected, but not alarmingly so. It could be due to stress, as you mentioned, or other factors we’ll explore. I'm going to check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s a bit… surprising. Is that normal? Yes, I think it moved. It's been so long since anyone checked my reflexes. My late husband… he used to tease me about my quick reactions. Said I was always jumping at shadows. Is everything alright, Doctor? I'm starting to feel a little anxious now, if you don’t mind me saying so. I just want to know if I'm fit to operate the machinery, that's all. I don't want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: The reflexes are a little diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. No cause for immediate concern. Your anxiety is likely contributing to your elevated blood pressure. It’s important to remain calm. Now, I'm going to perform a brief neurological assessment. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head.
PATIENT: In… and out… up… and down… It's a bit… disorienting, honestly. My eyes are getting tired. I haven’t used my eyes this much in ages. Are you seeing anything wrong? I sometimes have trouble with my vision, especially at night. My late husband always said I needed to get my eyes checked. He was probably right, as usual. Is everything alright? I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. It's a bit overwhelming, honestly. I’m starting to feel a little lightheaded.
DOCTOR: You appear slightly unsteady, and your skin is a little pale. It’s possible your anxiety is causing some lightheadedness. I’m going to recommend a quick blood test to rule out any underlying issues. It will check your blood sugar, electrolytes, and complete blood count. While we wait for the results, I'd like to discuss your blood pressure management. It's important to keep it under control to prevent complications. Do you consistently take your prescribed medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A blood test? Is it something serious? I… I try to take my medication. Sometimes I forget, though. My memory is just terrible, you see. And other times, I just… feel fine. So I skip it. Is that bad? My late husband always reminded me to take my pills. He was very organized, very… meticulous. I just don't have his…discipline. And honestly, Doctor, I'm a bit scared now. Is everything alright? I just want to go home. This is all very overwhelming. I just want to know if I can still operate the machinery. That's all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, the blood test is simply a precaution. We need to gather more information to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and lightheadedness. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Skipping your medication, even occasionally, can significantly impact your blood pressure control. It’s crucial to take it as prescribed. And, truthfully, your anxiety is contributing to your symptoms. We can discuss strategies to manage that as well. However, before we proceed, I need to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not exactly. But sometimes I feel a tightness in my chest, especially when I’m anxious. Shortness of breath… yes, occasionally. When I climb stairs, or… exert myself. And dizziness… yes, like I said, sometimes I feel lightheaded. Especially when I stand up quickly. It’s just… getting older, isn't it? My late husband always said I was too stressed. He would tell me to slow down, to relax. He was probably right. But it's hard. I worry about things. I worry about my job, about my health, about… everything. Is that what’s causing all this? The anxiety? Is there anything I can do about it? I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with anxiety and potentially some underlying cardiovascular issues. It's good you’re acknowledging these feelings, Ms. Hughston. It’s important not to dismiss them. Given your symptoms and history, I’m going to recommend a more comprehensive evaluation. This will include an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function and potentially a referral to a cardiologist for further investigation. And we’ll need to explore options for managing your anxiety, such as therapy or medication. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always a bit… tense. And my father… he died of a stroke, I believe. A long time ago, though. I don’t remember the details very well. It was… traumatic. And my late husband… he had heart problems, as I mentioned. That's why he needed all the medication. It seems like… heart disease runs in my family, doesn't it? Is that… a bad sign? I just want to know if I’m going to end up like them. Is that too much to ask? I just want to be healthy, to live a long and happy life. But it seems like… fate is against me. I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Given your family history, your symptoms, and your current blood pressure reading, it's prudent to proceed with a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will end up like your family members, but it's important to rule out any underlying issues. I’m going to order the ECG immediately, and I'll write a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly-regarded cardiologist. He can perform further tests, such as an echocardiogram, to assess your heart function in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and managing your stress levels. I’ll also write a prescription for a low-dose anti-anxiety medication to help you cope with your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… more tests… more medication… It's a lot. But… I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Yes… yes, that sounds acceptable. I just… I wish my late husband were here. He would know what to do. He always knew what to do. But… alright. A cardiologist. Anti-anxiety medication. What about the drug test? Is that still necessary? I just want to know if I can still operate the machinery. That’s all. Is it going to show anything? Will it affect my job? I’m so worried. Is there anything else I should know? I just feel so… lost.
DOCTOR: The drug test is still required by your employer, Ms. Hughston, but we can discuss your concerns with the medical review officer if you are worried about the results. It’s unlikely to affect your job unless there is a positive finding. However, given your current anxiety and the potential for underlying cardiovascular issues, I’m going to recommend temporarily suspending your work duties until we have a clearer understanding of your health status. This isn’t a judgement, simply a precaution. I will also provide you with a detailed note for your employer explaining the situation and recommending a temporary leave of absence. I understand this is a difficult situation, and I want to assure you that I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the referral to Dr. Ramirez or the medication I’m prescribing?
PATIENT: Suspend my work duties? A leave of absence? But… that's my livelihood! I can’t afford to be off work! I have bills to pay! What will I do? This is… this is too much. I just wanted a simple drug test. I didn’t ask for any of this. I feel… I feel completely overwhelmed. What kind of medication are you prescribing? Will it make me sleepy? Will it interact with my blood pressure medication? I just… I don’t know what to do. I just want to go home. I just want to be left alone. Is there… is there anyone I can talk to? Someone who can help me with all of this? I feel so… alone. And scared. So, so scared. .
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s okay to be scared and overwhelmed. Take a deep breath. It's a lot to process, I understand. The medication I'm prescribing is a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . It's often used to treat anxiety and depression, and it generally has minimal side effects. We will start with a very low dose and monitor your response closely. It can cause some drowsiness initially, but it typically subsides. And yes, there is a potential for interaction with your blood pressure medication, which is why we will monitor your blood pressure closely while you’re on it. I also want to connect you with our social worker, Ms. Davies. She can help you navigate the paperwork, discuss financial assistance options, and provide emotional support. Here’s her number. Please call her as soon as you feel ready. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment with you in one week to discuss your symptoms and the results of the ECG. Do you have any immediate questions?
