DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. Like it just… stays in there. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a couple weeks. Not real painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble with complete bladder emptying, you're saying?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds right. Complete… emptying. It’s like it doesn’t all come out when I try. I have to… push a little harder than I used to, and sometimes… sometimes I still feel like there’s some left. It worries me a bit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how often are you urinating throughout the day, generally?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I usually go… maybe four or five times a day, Doctor. Not a lot more than usual, I don’t think. But like I said, it’s not coming out all at once. It takes… effort. And sometimes I have to go back a little while later to get the rest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And are you experiencing any pain during urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really pain. It's not a sharp pain, or burning, or anything like that. It’s more… a straining feeling. Like I have to push to get it going, and even then it feels… weak, you know? Not a strong stream. It’s just… uncomfortable. Not something that keeps me up at night, but it’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything looks… normal, as far as I can tell. Same color as always, and I don’t smell anything different. I try to drink plenty of water, you see. I always have, even when it was colder. I figured that would help.
DOCTOR: Drinking plenty of water is good. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, not much. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they got it under control with some pills. I don't take them anymore, though. The doctor said it was okay to stop. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she was the one who took care of most of the doctor stuff. I don’t remember a whole lot else, to be honest. I’m sorry. It was a while ago. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It is. We can work with that. Any surgeries, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And… oh, I had a bit of a knee problem a few years back, but they just cleaned it up with some… some surgery. Nothing major. That’s all I can remember, Doctor. I wasn’t very good at remembering things, even before… well, you know. It's been a few years. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one, Doctor. My wife's family… I didn't know them real well. And my own family… my brothers and sisters… well, they’ve all passed on now. I remember my father had some trouble with his heart, but that was a long time ago. I’m not sure about anything else, to be honest. I don't remember anyone having trouble with… with their water, if that’s what you mean. Sorry I can't be much help with that.
DOCTOR: It’s… acceptable. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t do any of that. Never have. I don’t care for the taste of alcohol, and I never got into smoking. And I certainly don’t do… recreational drugs. I just drink water, mostly. And a little bit of tea sometimes. My wife always made good tea. Sorry… sometimes I just miss her. But no, Doctor. I don't do any of that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s perform a quick physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you don't mind. We'll start with abdominal palpation, and then I'd like to check a prostate exam, if you're comfortable with that. It's standard procedure for these types of symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh. A prostate exam? Well… I've never had one of those before, Doctor. Is it… is it necessary? I mean, is there any other way? I just… I don't know… it sounds a little… uncomfortable. Is it going to hurt? I’m just a bit… nervous. Could you explain it to me a little more?
DOCTOR: It is necessary to get a complete picture, Mr. Hilber. It allows me to assess the size and condition of your prostate gland, which can contribute to urinary issues. It involves a gloved, lubricated finger being inserted into the rectum to feel the gland. It can be uncomfortable, yes, but it is typically brief. We can take it slow. If you are truly uncomfortable, we can postpone it, but it will significantly limit my ability to accurately assess your condition. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and risks in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose. If it’s necessary, then… then I guess I can try. But please… go slow, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doing as you go, alright? I just… I don’t like surprises. And… what exactly are we looking for? If you don’t mind explaining… just a little bit. It’s just… a bit frightening, to be honest. I haven’t had… well, you know. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’re looking for any irregularities in size, shape, or texture of the prostate. An enlarged prostate is common with age and can obstruct urine flow. We’re also checking for any tenderness or nodules, which could indicate other issues. I will use plenty of lubricant, and as I mentioned, we’ll go slowly. I will explain each step as I go. Please relax as much as possible. I’ll let you know when we begin. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Just… go slow, alright? And tell me what you’re doing. I’m… ready, I suppose. As ready as I’ll ever be. Thank you for explaining things. It helps. Just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. I’m going to apply some lubricant to the finger now. It may feel cool. I will then gently insert it into your rectum. Remember to breathe deeply. This will help you relax. Here we go. This will only take a moment. I'm applying the lubricant now… Alright, gently inserting the finger… I am able to palpate the prostate gland… It feels slightly enlarged, but smooth… No nodules are immediately apparent… There is some mild tenderness on the left side… The gland feels symmetrical… No other significant abnormalities are detected at this time. Alright, we’re finished. That’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Well… that wasn't as bad as I thought, I suppose. Still… not very comfortable. So… what did you find, Doctor? You said it was… enlarged? Is that bad? And what about the tenderness? Is that something I should be worried about? Is it… is it serious? I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: The prostate is slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age. The mild tenderness could indicate inflammation, possibly a mild prostatitis. However, without further testing, it's difficult to say definitively. We need to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a PSA test to assess your prostate-specific antigen levels. Elevated PSA levels can sometimes indicate prostate cancer, though it can also be elevated due to other benign conditions. It’s a standard precaution. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Cancer? You said… cancer? Oh dear. I don’t… I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it likely? Do you think it’s cancer? I don’t want to have cancer, Doctor. I just… I lost my wife to cancer last year. I don’t want… What exactly is a PSA test? And what does it involve? Will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. Cancer… it’s a scary word.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, please try to remain calm. I said it can be elevated. An elevated PSA level does not automatically mean you have cancer. It simply means we need to investigate further. A PSA test is a blood test, a standard laboratory procedure. It will not hurt, it’s just a small needle prick. It will take a few days to get the results back. The urinalysis will also help us rule out infection. It's a simple urine sample. We are simply gathering information at this stage. It is far too early to make any conclusions. We will discuss the results when they are available. I’m going to write the orders for those tests now. Do you have any other questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… I’ll try to stay calm. It’s just… hard. Losing my wife… and now this… I just want to know what’s going on. I’ll get the tests done, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Thank you. When should I come back to discuss the results? And where do I go for the blood work? I don't drive anymore, you see. My son usually takes me. I just… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You can have the blood work done at the lab across the street, at St. Jude's. Here’s a slip with the address and instructions. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week, same time, so we can discuss the results. I understand your concerns, Mr. Hilber. We will proceed methodically and address each issue as it arises. It’s likely this is a simple case of prostatitis, but we must rule out other possibilities. Do you have any questions about the lab instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The instructions seem clear enough. St. Jude's… one week. Alright. Thank you… thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate it. And thank you for being patient with me. It's just… a lot to take in. I'll get the tests done as soon as possible. And I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, severe pain, inability to urinate – please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
