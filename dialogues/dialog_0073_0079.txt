DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's about my bruising. It's just…been happening a lot more lately, and I'm on that blood thinner, you know? Warfarin, I think it's called. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. I see it listed here. And you say this bruising is more than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Like, I bumped my arm on the table a couple days ago - normal little bump - and ended up with a bruise the size of my hand. Usually it's just a little color, you know? This one…it’s dark and kinda sore. And I keep finding little ones I don’t even remember doing anything to. It's just…a lot.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this increased bruising been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… maybe the last month or so? It's hard to say exactly. It wasn’t sudden, just…gradual. Started with a couple more little ones popping up, and now it’s like…this. I really don’t want to end up in the hospital, Doctor. That stuff scares me.
DOCTOR: Well, we certainly don’t want that. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Not really… I started a new vitamin, I guess? Just a multivitamin. My friend said it was good for energy. And…oh! I switched brands of tea. Started drinking that hibiscus tea. That’s it, I think. Everything else is pretty much the same. Why? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can matter. Some supplements and even herbal teas can interact with Warfarin. We need to be thorough. Do you remember the name of the multivitamin?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see... it was... Nature's Best, I think? It was a big bottle, from the drugstore. And the tea... it just said "Hibiscus Bloom" on the box. I don't really pay attention to all the little details, to be honest. I just wanted something nice to drink. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, Ms. Hainley, but it’s helpful to know these things. We need to assess if these might be contributing to the increased bruising. Now, aside from the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I feel okay, mostly. A little tired, but that's normal for me. No headaches or anything. Oh, wait… my gums bled a little when I was brushing my teeth last night. Just a tiny bit, but I hadn’t noticed that before. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a symptom. Okay. And have you had any recent injuries, falls, or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm pretty careful, honestly. I haven’t fallen or anything. No surgeries in years. Just…the bruising. It’s really worrying me, Doctor. I keep thinking something serious is wrong. I don’t want to end up with a blood clot or something, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. We're going to investigate this thoroughly. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we'll order some blood work to check your Warfarin levels and see if there are any other issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Physical exam first, then blood work? Okay. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here, I'll start with a general examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at the areas where you've been experiencing bruising. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Take a deep breath for me, please…and exhale. Good. Now, can you point to where you've noticed the most bruising?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It’s mostly on my arms, like here and a little bit on my legs. And I think I had a little one pop up on my back the other day, but I’d need help looking at that. It’s hard to see back there, you know? It doesn’t hurt, just…there. Is that okay? Should I have worn shorts?
DOCTOR: No, shorts are fine. We can skip the back for now. I'm just assessing the size and tenderness of these bruises. Hmm. These bruises appear quite variable in size and coloration, as you mentioned. There's some tenderness to the touch here, but no signs of swelling or warmth. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is stable. I'm noting generalized bruising on bilateral forearms and shins. Tenderness present on palpation, but no evidence of acute injury. Now, let's get those blood tests ordered. I'll need to draw a few vials.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Blood tests, then. I hate needles, but…if that’s what it takes. How long will it take to get the results? And will you explain them to me when I get them? I always get so confused with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. Needles aren’t pleasant for anyone. The blood draw will be quick. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. And absolutely, I will explain everything to you in plain language. No medical jargon, I promise. We’ll go over each result together, and I’ll answer any questions you have. Let's go ahead and get you down to the lab now. The phlebotomist will take excellent care of you. Then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they're available.
PATIENT: Okay. Lead the way. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better. Hopefully it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. That’s what I’m here for. And try not to worry too much. We’re being proactive, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Just relax, and the phlebotomist will get you taken care of.
PATIENT: .
