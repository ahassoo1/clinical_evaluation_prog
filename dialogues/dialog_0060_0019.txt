DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah… yes. My wife… she want baby. We… old now. Maybe need help? I not remember all the things doctor say before. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you and your wife are trying to conceive. And you're concerned about… age being a factor. Okay. Just to clarify, you’re 70 years old, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Seventy. My wife… maybe sixty-five? Something like that. We happy together. Long marriage. Just… not easy now. Everything… slower.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, attempting to conceive at this age… presents significant challenges. It’s not something that happens easily, or often, naturally. Has your wife had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, she had… children. Many years ago. Two, I think? Maybe three? It was before I met her. She not talk about it much. Sad times, she say. But… she always want more. Always a kind woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has she been seeing anyone for her health, like a gynecologist?
PATIENT: Gy…ne…co…logist? I not know this doctor. She see regular doctor, for… old people things. But not… this one. She just take pills for… the water. And for her bones. She not complain much. She strong woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are either of you experiencing any health problems currently?
PATIENT: Me? Not much. Little bit tired, sometimes. Old age, you know? My back… aches a little. Nothing serious. My wife… she good too. Maybe a little forgetful, like me! But she walks good, eats good. No big problems, thank goodness. We lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Carlotta, I’m going to be blunt. Conceiving naturally at your age is highly unlikely. And even if it were to happen, the risks to both your wife and the potential baby are substantial. We'd need to do some tests to assess her overall health and hormone levels. But, frankly, I think you should seriously consider exploring other options for building your family, like adoption, if that is what you truly desire. Have you considered that?
PATIENT: Adoption? No… we want our own baby. We always dream of this. Maybe… a little help from doctor? Is that possible? We not give up yet. We love each other very much. We want a little one to hold. Is there… any medicine? Any way at all?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Carlotta, I'm going to be realistic. I can order some basic bloodwork to rule out any underlying health issues in your wife. But I want to manage expectations. I'm not going to put her through a fertility workup at her age. It’s invasive, expensive, and frankly, it's not likely to yield positive results. Perhaps a consultation with a specialist in reproductive endocrinology is warranted… but I strongly suggest you discuss the realities of conception at this age with them before pursuing any further testing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Bloodwork… okay. But… specialist? Is that mean… no hope? I just want baby. My wife… she very sad. We not ask for much. Just little one. Maybe the specialist… can help? Can do something? Please. Tell me… is there anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I’m going to order the bloodwork. And I will give you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a reproductive endocrinologist. However, I need you to understand that I am doing this to be thorough, not because I believe there’s a high probability of success. Dr. Ramirez will be able to provide a more detailed assessment and discuss all available options, which may include assisted reproductive technologies, such as in-vitro fertilization… although, realistically, even those options have a very low success rate in cases like this. Do you understand that I am not offering any guarantees and that this may be a difficult journey with a potentially disappointing outcome?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Hard journey… disappointing. But… we try. Bloodwork… and Dr. Ramirez. Thank you, doctor. You… you help us try. That is enough. Tell me… how long for bloodwork? And… where we go for Dr. Ramirez? My wife… she want to know. She worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll need a copy of your insurance card. As for Dr. Ramirez, here’s a referral slip and her contact information. She’s located about an hour’s drive from here in the city. Her office will schedule an appointment for you. It’s usually a few weeks out, given her schedule. I'll also have the nurse give you information on the potential costs associated with a consultation and any further testing. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you again, doctor. You very kind. And… tell the nurse thank you too. We appreciate your help. We go now… do bloodwork. And then… call Dr. Ramirez. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome. Let the nurse know if you have any trouble locating the lab. Have a good day.
