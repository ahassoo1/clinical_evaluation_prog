DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer, they say. And my mother, she… she had something bad too, a long time ago. I don’t want… I don’t want that to happen to me. Just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Get some peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious given your family history. However, simply fearing a condition doesn’t… necessarily mean you have it. We need to be methodical. Let's start with you. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Uh… not really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m old, right? 73. I guess old people get tired. Nothing… nothing big. No pain, no… stuff like that. Just… worried. Is that a symptom? Being worried?
DOCTOR: Worry is a… perfectly valid emotion, Mr. Schwer, but not a medical symptom in itself. Fatigue, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, fatigue. Not all the time. Just… some days. Especially after I work. I sell things, you know? Wholesale. Lots of driving. Sometimes I just… feel worn out. And I don't sleep as good as I used to. Wake up a lot. But… I don't know. Maybe that’s just getting old too. My ex-wife says I always worry too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this fatigue been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… six months? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say. It comes and goes. Not every day is bad. Some days I feel pretty good, and I can work all day. Other days… I just want to sit down. It’s been getting… a little worse maybe, these last few months. But it’s hard to tell for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to other systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… uh… no, not really. I eat okay. I like my food. Maybe a little less than I used to, but… I’m trying to watch my weight. I’m a skinny guy, as you can see. Always have been. But I don’t think I’ve lost weight. I don’t have a scale. My ex-wife had the scale.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? You mean… going to the bathroom? Well, I’m an old man, Doctor. Things change! Everything’s a little slower, if you know what I mean. But nothing… nothing wrong. Just… old man stuff. I don’t know what you want me to say. Is that bad? Should I be worried about that too?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history. We need to be precise. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? No! No blood. Definitely no blood. That would be… bad, right? No, no blood. I would know. I check. Sort of. After… you know. No blood. I’m pretty sure. Look, Doctor, I just came here because my sister is sick and I’m worried. I don’t need to talk about… that stuff. Is there a test I can take to see if I'm okay? Just a simple test?
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with some basic bloodwork. It will give us a general overview. But frankly, your anxiety is not a medical condition. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… not that I know of. I don't take much medicine. Maybe a little something for a cold sometimes. Nothing regular. My ex-wife used to give me… things. I don’t remember what they were. She liked the doctor. I just… went along with it. I don't think I’m allergic to anything. Never had a bad reaction. But I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is always important, Mr. Schwer. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Just… vitamins sometimes. A multi-vitamin. Old people take vitamins, right? But I don't take them every day. I forget. My sister sends them to me. Says I need them. But I mostly forget. Does that matter? It’s not like I take a lot of anything. Just the vitamins. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Is it going to hurt? I don't like doctors poking around. Just… try to be gentle, okay? I'm an old man. Everything hurts already.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, albeit slightly elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, please roll over. I need to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Reflexes…? What are you looking for? Is something wrong? My sister said… she said the cancer, it… it spreads. Does this test tell you if I have that? Just… tell me if something’s wrong, okay? I don't want to be kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished, which is not uncommon for someone of your age. No asymmetry noted. Now, sit up. I'll take a look at your throat. Open your mouth, please.
PATIENT: Okay. My throat? Is it red? I had a little cough last week. Nothing bad. Just… a tickle. Is it bad? Is it something…? Don't tell me it’s something bad, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Throat is mildly erythematous, no exudates noted. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Now, that is all for the physical examination. We will send your bloodwork to the lab. The results should be available in approximately three to five business days.
PATIENT: Three to five days…? That's a long time. What are you looking for in the blood? Is it something… serious? My sister… she’s really sick, Doctor. I don’t want to be like her. Can you just… tell me what you think? Is everything okay? Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, your anxiety is palpable. The bloodwork is a standard panel to assess your overall health and rule out any gross abnormalities. It is unlikely to reveal anything of significant concern, but we must be thorough. I would suggest that you attempt to manage your anxiety. Perhaps consider mindfulness exercises or… We will contact you with the results. Do you have any other… concerns?
