DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is okay to call you Doctor Cumper? I am here… my husband and me, we are thinking about… a place for me to live. A nice place for older people. He wants me to get check first. For the place, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do call me Doctor Cumper. That's perfectly fine. I understand. Your husband wants you to have a check-up before considering a move to a senior living facility – that's very thoughtful of him. To get a good picture of your overall health, let’s start with what’s been going on with you recently. Can you tell me about any health concerns or symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not much, really. I get… tired sometimes. Old tired, you know? Not sick tired. Just… slow. And my knees, they bother me when it rains. My husband, he help me with the stairs. But other than that… I eat okay, I sleep okay. I forget things, but… I always forget things!
DOCTOR: Okay, "old tired" and knee pain with the rain – that gives me a starting point. It's good to hear you're eating and sleeping well. And forgetting things is… well, common as we get older, as you said. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When you say tired, is it constant fatigue, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It come and go, I think. Some days I have lots of energy, I can do things. Other days… I just want to sit. I don’t have to sit, but… I want to. It's not a bad tired, just… heavy. Like my body is made of rocks.
DOCTOR: "Made of rocks," I like that description. That's helpful. And how long have you been noticing this coming and going tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Maybe… a year? Two years? It’s hard to say. Things slow down when you get old, you know? Time… it feels different. It's not a new thing, I just… maybe I pay more attention to it now. My husband worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good your husband is looking out for you. And you're right, time does feel different as we age. A year or two of this "heavy" feeling is good information. Now, let's talk a bit about those knees. You said they bother you when it rains. Is it just the rain, or is there anything else that makes the pain worse, like walking or going up stairs?
PATIENT: Mostly the rain. But stairs… yes, stairs are hard. And if I walk too much, they get achy. Not all the time, though. Some days I can walk to the store, some days… no. They just feel stiff. I put some cream on them, helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain is worse with rain and stairs, and sometimes with walking, but varies. And the cream helps a little. That’s useful to know. Now, to get a fuller picture, I'm going to ask you some questions about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… a long time ago, he said my pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill, but it made me feel funny, so I stopped taking it. He didn’t like that, but I felt better! Other than that… no, not really. I had a baby, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but you stopped the medication due to side effects. We'll definitely need to check that again today. And congratulations on having a baby – that's a wonderful thing! To continue, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the baby?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Just the baby, and that was a long time ago. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that healed okay. Nothing else, I think. I don’t go to the doctor much. If it isn't broken, I don’t bother him!
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides the baby and a childhood wrist fracture. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my knees. And sometimes, when my stomach hurts, I drink chamomile tea. My mother always said chamomile tea fixes everything! No pills, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the knee cream and chamomile tea as needed. Very good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he is allergic to cats, but I like cats! Never had a problem with anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had a bad heart. She died when I was young. My father, he died old, just… stopped breathing in his sleep. And my sister… she forget things a lot, when she got older. She… she wasn't as lucky as me with her mind.
DOCTOR: I see. A history of heart disease in your mother, and some memory issues in your sister. That's important information. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? I live with my husband, we have a small garden. I cook, I clean, I try to keep busy. We watch television sometimes. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. Just trying to get a sense of your daily routine. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never. My husband, he used to drink a little beer, but not anymore. It wasn’t good for his stomach. No, no smoking, no drinking, no… other things. Just tea. Lots of tea!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your health, or any concerns you have that we haven't discussed yet?
PATIENT: Hmm… I worry about falling. My husband says I’m steady, but… I get dizzy sometimes. When I stand up too fast, or bend over. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does… it’s scary. And… I just want to be safe. That’s why we are looking at the place, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Abdollahi. The dizziness is important. We'll definitely check your blood pressure while you’re lying and standing to see if that might be contributing. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam now. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Just… be gentle, please. My bones are old.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you could please sit here, that would be great. I will start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, I’m hearing a murmur. Nothing alarming at this moment, but we will need to do an EKG to get a better look. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure, and then check it again after you stand up. Can you just let me know if you feel dizzy at any point?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Blood pressure… is like when I feel funny?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. It's similar to the feeling of dizziness. I’m going to place this cuff around your arm and take a reading while you're sitting, and then I will have you stand up slowly and we will take it again after about a minute. This will help us see if your blood pressure drops when you change position. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated while seated. Now, if you could just gently stand up when you are ready… and let me know if you feel anything different. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… a little bit… light-headed. Like I might fall. Not bad, just… wobbly. I need to hold on.
DOCTOR: Okay, just stay right there, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s good to know. Your blood pressure dropped significantly when you stood up. This is likely the cause of the dizziness you’re feeling. This is called orthostatic hypotension. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam now, just to check your reflexes and balance. It's a simple assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is okay? It’s hard to keep still, my old bones creak.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. You’re doing great. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t unusual for someone your age, and your balance is a little unsteady, but not alarmingly so. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen, just to see if anything sounds unusual. Please let me know if you feel any pain when I press on your stomach.
PATIENT: Oh… a little sore there. On the left side. It comes and goes, though. Mostly after I eat something heavy. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness on the left side of your abdomen, particularly after eating. That could be a number of things. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. We have quite a bit of information. Your blood pressure is elevated, your heart rhythm is irregular, you experienced a significant drop in blood pressure when you stood up, you have some dizziness, diminished reflexes, and tenderness in your abdomen. I want to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to look at your heart rhythm, and a urinalysis. We may also need to consider a CT scan of your abdomen, depending on the results of these initial tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my… so many tests. Is something bad wrong, Doctor? Maybe I should just stay home and rest?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like a lot, but these tests are to help us get a full picture. They don’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, it’s just a precaution to rule out any potential issues. The drop in blood pressure and dizziness are the most concerning things right now, and we want to understand why that’s happening. The other tests are to get a general overview of your health. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, especially given your family history. We will start with the blood work and EKG, and then we can discuss the possibility of a CT scan if needed. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan… is that the one with the big machine? My sister, she had one of those. It made her very nervous. Will I be… poked a lot? I don't like needles very much. And what about the results? How long will I have to wait? I want to get this sorted out, so I can decide about the place… and not worry all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, the CT scan uses a large machine, but we'll talk about that if we need it. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous about these things. We can always discuss options and make sure you feel comfortable. Regarding the blood work, yes, there will be a small needle prick. It's usually quick, and the nurse is very good at it. We can use a topical numbing cream if you’d like. The results for the blood work and EKG usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated and avoiding standing up too quickly. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Hydrated… yes, I can do that. I like water. And the nurse is good? That’s good to know. I think… that’s all the questions I have right now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so carefully. You are very kind. Could you… maybe write down the instructions for the tests? I forget things, you know. And my husband, he is not good with medical things either.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's what I'm here for. Here you go. It has all the instructions, the contact number if you have any questions, and a reminder to stay hydrated. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and do the EKG now. If you feel any dizziness at any point during the EKG, please let her know immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper. You made me feel much better. I just hope the results are not too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll be reviewing your results carefully, and we’ll discuss everything thoroughly when we meet again. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns in the meantime. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready.
