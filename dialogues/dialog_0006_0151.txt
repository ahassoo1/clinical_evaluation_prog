DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Uzarski, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, and I thought maybe it would just go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands… for how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe… three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, it’s not constant. Some days it’s worse than others, definitely. It's hard to keep track, with the route and everything.
DOCTOR: Right, comes and goes… and the route… you said?
PATIENT: Yes, I deliver the mail. Postal Service. Lots of walking, lots of handling things… packages, letters… It's a good job, keeps me busy, but I’m starting to worry it's something to do with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, postal work… that's good to know. And is the tingling in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, actually. Though, my left hand feels it a little more, I think. It started there, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. They both go numb sometimes, too. Not completely numb, but… less feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Less feeling… alright. And do you notice it at any particular time of day, or when you're doing specific things besides work?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it’s worse at night, when I’m trying to sleep. It wakes me up sometimes. And when I’m holding something small, like… a teacup, or knitting, it seems to bother it more. It's not a sharp pain, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night, with small movements… Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. Just tired, I guess. But I am 63, Doctor. Who isn’t tired? I don't have any aches or anything like that, or trouble with my balance. Just the tingling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical problems that you know of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was fine after I started walking more. Besides that… nothing. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life, really. No insurance, though, so I don’t go to the doctor unless I really need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, well that's good to know. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even for tonsils when I was a little girl. My mother always said I was too stubborn to let anyone near me with a scalpel.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my husband passed away five years ago. We didn’t have children. I have a sister in Ukraine, but I haven't seen her in… oh, it must be twenty years now. She’s probably fine, but we don’t talk often. As for family history… I don’t really know. No one talked much about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just a cup of tea in the morning, that’s all. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look at your hands. Just so I can get a better idea. Can you hold your hands out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Okay… your strength seems good in both hands, and your reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to gently touch your hands with this cotton ball. Tell me when you can feel it. Let's start with this finger. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. A little bit ticklish, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay… and this one?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that too. Seems a little… duller, maybe, on my left hand, but I feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems like there's a slight decrease in sensation in your left hand, as you mentioned. I’m going to check your pulse as well. Everything seems okay there. Now, this could be a number of things, Mrs. Uzarski. It could be related to your work, perhaps some mild carpal tunnel syndrome or compression of the nerves in your wrists. It could also be something else entirely. It’s difficult to say for sure without a little more information. We could do some tests, like nerve conduction studies, but those can be expensive. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Expensive… That’s not good. No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with medications, thankfully. I… I don’t know about those tests. I’m really just hoping it’s something that will go away on its own. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be serious in the sense of being immediately life-threatening, Mrs. Uzarski. However, if it continues to worsen or doesn't improve with time, it's important to get it checked out. Here's what I recommend: For now, try to avoid repetitive hand movements as much as possible. If you're holding something small, take frequent breaks. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, could help with any discomfort. Also, there are wrist braces you can get at the pharmacy that might offer some support. If it doesn't improve within a month, or if you start to experience weakness in your hands, numbness that travels up your arm, or any change in your grip, please come back and see me, or see another doctor. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. So, take breaks, wrist brace, and pain relievers… and come back if it gets worse. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. It's just… with no insurance, it's hard to know what to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Uzarski. I understand. It's always best to try conservative measures first. And don't hesitate to come back if you're concerned. I'll make a note of everything we discussed today. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. You explained everything very clearly. I just… I hope it’s nothing too bad. I need my hands for my job, you know? Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Uzarski. I hope so too. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor Gorga. Thank you. .
