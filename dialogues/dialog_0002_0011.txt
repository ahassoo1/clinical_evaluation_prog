DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Doctor…Ranjan, is it? Yes, well. I got a… a thing I wanna get done. A cosmetic… improvement. And I need to be cleared to do it. Frankly, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s a simple procedure, really. Shouldn't take long to approve.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re looking for medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure and want to keep things efficient. No problem at all, we can definitely work through that. To get started, could you tell me a little more about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s not complicated. It’s… on my face. Look, I don’t really remember all the details. Some young fella told me about it. Said it would fix things. It involves… needles, I think. And some cream. Honestly, I just need a doctor to say it's alright. I ain't got time for a whole explanation. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you’re primarily looking for a general health assessment to ensure you're a good candidate for this procedure, even without knowing all the specifics. That’s perfectly alright – we can still do that. Just to be thorough, even though you don’t recall the details, do you remember where on your face this procedure is planned?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, Doctor, this is ridiculous. It's… around my chin, I think. Maybe my jawline? Honestly, it’s been a while. A younger man explained it to me at… a place. A business. That’s all I remember. I don’t have time to play twenty questions! Are you going to clear me or not? It’s not like it's brain surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Armando. It's just that knowing the exact location helps me assess any potential risks. Around the chin and jawline… that area has a lot of nerves and blood vessels. To help me get a better picture, have you had anything similar done before?
PATIENT: Similar? No! Absolutely not. I’m a sensible man, Doctor. I wouldn’t go messing with my face unless it was… necessary. This is my first time. And frankly, I’m starting to regret even coming in here. All these questions… It's a waste of my time. Just tell me if I'm healthy enough. I eat my vegetables. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it's your first time. And I appreciate you mentioning the vegetables! It is helpful to get a sense of your overall health. Let's quickly run through some basic medical questions, just to be safe. Could you tell me about any medical conditions you have – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else your other doctors have told you about?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I'm a sensible man! I keep myself together. I… I don’t have any of those problems. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Goodness no. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. I used to be very active, before… well, before. I don’t go to doctors. They just tell you bad news. Is that good enough? Now, can we please get this over with? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I understand you don't regularly see doctors and feel healthy. Just to be complete, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Heavens no. Surgeries? Goodness gracious. No. Never. I told you, I’m a sensible man! I take care of myself. I fix things myself if I need to. I don’t go around getting cut open. This is getting ridiculous. Are you writing all this down? It’s a waste of paper. Now, can we finally get to the approval? I’ve got things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I am writing everything down, as it's important for your medical record, even the information about your general good health. One last quick question, and then we can move on to a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. I take what I need. No allergies. Absolutely none. Look, Doctor, this is a simple procedure. I don't need a full medical workup. I just need your signature. This is getting absurd. I’m a grown man. I know my own body. Can we please move this along? My patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Armando. No allergies, no surgeries, no hospitalizations, and you feel generally healthy. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick look at the area where you’re planning the procedure. Just a basic check to make sure everything looks okay. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. I haven’t got all day, you know. And don’t poke around too much. I don’t like being touched. Just get it over with. Quickly. And quietly. I have appointments. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll check your blood pressure and take a quick look at the area on your chin and jawline. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 150 over 90. And I’m hearing a slight murmur when I listen to your heart. Have you ever had your blood pressure checked before?
PATIENT: Elevated? Murmur? What are you talking about? I feel fine! Never had my… my whatchamacallit… “blood pressure” checked. I told you, I don't go to doctors! What does it even mean? A murmur? Sounds… unpleasant. Look, I don’t like this. I feel perfectly healthy. This is a waste of my time. Are you saying I can’t get the procedure? Because I assure you, I’m a sensible man, and I know what I’m doing. This is getting ridiculous. Just say yes or no. Can I get it done or not? I haven’t got all day to sit here while you poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I understand your frustration. The elevated blood pressure and murmur are reasons for concern. While the procedure itself might be simple, these findings suggest you should have a more thorough evaluation by a cardiologist before proceeding. I'm not saying you can't get the procedure, but it wouldn't be ethical for me to clear you without knowing more about what's causing these findings. It could be something minor, but it needs to be checked out. I strongly recommend seeing a cardiologist for a full evaluation. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A… a whatchamacallit… cardiologist? Are you kidding me? Look, Doctor, I came here for a simple clearance, not a whole medical workup! I don’t need to see another doctor. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you repeatedly. This is a complete waste of my time and money. I’m leaving. And frankly, I’m not impressed. I expect better service. I’m going to find another doctor who understands what a sensible man needs. Don't bother calling. And don’t expect a good review.
