DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Nestingen. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and honestly, it’s just really tiring. I… think it has something to do with something I was told a long time ago, something about my insides being sensitive? I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Diarrhea, alright. And you say this has been going on "for a bit now?
PATIENT: Yeah, “a bit”. Honestly, I’m not great with dates. Maybe… a couple of months? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been more come than go, if that makes sense. It’s just… frequent. And it’s really messing with things, you know? I don’t like leaving the house for long if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: A couple of months… frequent… and impacting your daily activities. Right. And you mentioned something about being told you have “sensitive insides” previously?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s what I remember. It was… a doctor, a long time ago, when I was younger, I think. They said something about my body not liking certain foods, or… something like that. It might have been IBD or… celiac? I really don’t know. It was a while ago, and I don't recall much about the appointment. My husband usually handles all the medical stuff, so… I don’t usually have to remember these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll need to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Let’s start with some basics. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I always assumed that was just from… everything. I don’t have any stomach pain, or fever, or anything like that. Just… the diarrhea. And feeling really drained, I guess. It's mostly just annoying, to be honest, and inconvenient.
DOCTOR: No abdominal pain, no fever. Just fatigue and the diarrhea. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, um… wow. That’s… a bit of a personal question! I… I don’t think so? I try not to look too closely, if you know what I mean. I haven’t seen anything obvious, but I guess I haven’t really been actively looking either. It’s just… kind of a mess, honestly. Sorry. Is that a normal thing to ask?
DOCTOR: It's a necessary question, Jase. We need to rule out anything serious. Alright. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, right, of course. Sorry. Um, let me think. I take a daily multivitamin, that’s about it. And no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My husband always says I have an iron stomach, which is ironic, I guess, considering everything. He’s the one who keeps track of all the allergy stuff, just in case. I don't think I've ever had a serious reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: No medications besides a multivitamin, no known allergies. Good. Now, let's talk about your diet. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? We’ve been eating mostly the same things. My husband does most of the cooking, and he's pretty consistent with his recipes. Maybe we had a bit more spicy food last week, but nothing too drastic. I don't think that would cause this, would it? I mean, I like spicy food, always have. He does make a really good vindaloo… but I've had that plenty of times before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the duration of your symptoms, and the lack of any other major changes, we’ll need to do some testing to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'm going to order a stool sample analysis, and a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Nestingen. I just want to figure out what’s going on and stop… this. Stool sample and blood test, okay. My husband will probably be more involved with the actual… collection process, if you know what I mean. He's always been good at that sort of thing. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Yes, your husband can assist. For the stool sample, you’ll need to collect three separate samples over a three-day period. The lab will provide instructions with the collection kit. For the blood test, you'll need to fast for eight hours beforehand. I’ll have the nurse give you detailed instructions before you leave. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, three samples and fasting. Got it. Husband will be informed. And… yeah, sure, I can lie down. Is there anything I should… wear? Or not wear? I never really know with these things.
DOCTOR: Just your usual clothing is fine, Jase. We'll just listen to your abdomen, and do a quick palpation. Nothing invasive. If you could lie on your back, that would be perfect.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. Just let me know if anything feels… weird, or anything. I’m not very good at this part, honestly. It makes me a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat hyperactive. No rebound tenderness. That's all normal, thankfully. It doesn't point to anything immediately serious. We'll send off the samples and review the results when they come back. It will likely be a few days.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Hyperactive sounds… is that a bad thing? Or just… normal for someone with a sensitive stomach? It’s just nice to hear that nothing feels seriously wrong. A few days, okay. My husband will be happy to hear that. Do you have any idea what we're looking for with the tests? Just so I have some idea… I feel a bit lost, honestly.
DOCTOR: We're looking for signs of infection, inflammation, and malabsorption. Essentially, we want to rule out common causes of chronic diarrhea, such as bacterial or parasitic infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease. It’s a process of elimination, Jase. Don’t worry too much about the details at this stage. We’ll discuss the results when they’re available. I will call you with the results or have my nurse contact you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, infection, inflammation, malabsorption… that makes sense, I guess. Process of elimination… right. Um… no, I think that’s everything, actually. Thank you, Dr. Nestingen. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain things to me, even if I don’t remember all of it. My husband will probably have a lot of questions when you call, though. He's the one with the… medical brain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. The nurse will provide you with the collection kits and instructions. We'll be in touch. You may get dressed.
