DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it's a bit strange, really. I've been getting really bothered by the light lately. Not like, a headache, more like… everything just feels too bright, even on cloudy days. It’s been happening for a few months now, and it’s starting to make things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, “too bright,” even on cloudy days… that is interesting. And it's been going on for several months now. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not a pain, like I said, but my eyes feel… strained, almost like they're working too hard. And sometimes, I get these little… sparkles in my vision, even when I close my eyes. It’s hard to explain. It started gradually, just noticing the sun was a bit much, but now even the lights inside, like here, feel pretty intense. I’m not sure if that makes sense? It's just… uncomfortable, really. And it worries me because my wife… she had some eye trouble before she passed, so I get a little anxious about things like this.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Arbin. And it's very good you're paying attention to it, especially with your wife's history. Those sparkles in your vision are important to note too. Okay, so strained eyes and sparkles, and it's been gradual. Does this happen all the time, or are there specific times of day or situations where it's worse?
PATIENT: It’s definitely worse when I’m outside, even with sunglasses. But honestly, it's been happening more and more indoors too, like you said. Mornings are the worst, I think. When I first wake up, everything feels incredibly bright. And if I’m looking at a computer screen for too long, it gets really bad. I work part-time doing some admin stuff, so I'm on the computer quite a bit. I try to take breaks, but… it doesn't always help. It’s just… constant, this sensitivity. It's just a bit of a bother, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, a constant bother is a good way to put it. Okay, worse in the mornings and with computer use. That gives us a little more to work with. Now, let’s back up a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the brightness sensitivity and sparkles?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. I haven’t noticed anything blurry, or spots, or anything like that. My distance vision seems okay, I can still read the signs when I’m driving, and I can see the TV fine. I did have to get a slightly stronger prescription for my glasses about a year ago, but that was just normal age-related stuff, the optometrist said. But no, nothing new besides the brightness and those little sparkles. I guess I haven’t been trying to look for changes, I just noticed everything being too bright. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Arbin. And it’s good you had an eye exam a year ago, even if it was just for a slight prescription change. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but it’s been well controlled with medication for a few years now. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, if you can believe it. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can. And… well, I’m a widower, so I don’t have a lot of stress in my life anymore, thankfully. I'm on Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure and on Medicare – good to know. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It’s good you’re focusing on your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20mg, once a day for the blood pressure. And… sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else regularly. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or animals or anything like that. My wife was the one with allergies, actually. She was allergic to cats, poor thing. But me, no, no allergies. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration, or any other medical conditions, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had cataracts when she got older, she needed surgery for them. And… my grandfather, on my father's side, he had diabetes, which I know can cause eye problems. Other than that, not really. My wife's family… her mother had some heart trouble, but nothing related to the eyes, as far as I know. It's hard to remember everything, honestly. We didn't talk about family medical history much. Does that help? I can try to think harder if you need me to.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Arbin, thank you. Cataracts and diabetes in the family are good to know. Okay, before we move on to a quick exam, just one last thing. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago, just didn’t enjoy it anymore. And definitely no recreational drugs. I keep pretty busy, and I don’t really feel the need for any of that. I like to garden, and I volunteer at the local library. Keeps me out of trouble, you know?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Arbin! Volunteering and gardening – those are great hobbies. Okay, well, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. I’d like to do a quick eye exam now, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do or look at.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m just going to check your visual acuity – that’s how well you can see at different distances. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Okay… uh… E, F, P, T… uh… L… and… Z! Is that right? I think that’s right. It’s a little blurry, though. It’s not as sharp as it usually is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good, and you’re right, it is a little blurry. Your vision is 20/30 in both eyes, which is slightly reduced, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to focus on this point here, and I’ll hold up fingers in your side vision. Just tell me when you can see them.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m focusing on the point… Uh… I think I see one… on the right… now… uh… yes, there! And… now on the left… a little faint, but I see it. Is that how it works? I’m trying to be as accurate as possible. It feels a little… odd.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Arbin. It is a little odd, but you're doing perfectly. Your peripheral vision is slightly constricted in both eyes, but again, not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to use this instrument to look into your eyes. I’ll just dim the lights for a moment. “Optic discs are sharp and well-defined, no signs of papilledema. Vessels appear normal in caliber, no hemorrhages or exudates. Maculae are intact, no drusen noted. The lens shows some mild age-related changes, expected for your age.” “No obvious signs of glaucoma or macular degeneration.”
PATIENT: Okay… That’s good to hear… about no glaucoma or macular degeneration. Everything sounds… technical. Is the age-related change in the lens something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's not something to worry about right now, Arbin. It's a very common finding as we get older, similar to getting wrinkles. It just means the lens is becoming a little less clear, which can contribute to some mild blurriness. It doesn't require any treatment at this time. Okay, so to summarize, your vision is slightly reduced, your peripheral vision is slightly constricted, and you have some mild age-related changes in your lens. Given your symptoms of light sensitivity and sparkles, and your history, I believe this is likely a combination of factors, potentially related to dry eye and some mild age-related changes in your vision. It doesn't sound like anything urgently concerning, but I want to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay… dry eye… that makes sense. I do feel like my eyes get dry sometimes, especially when I’m reading or on the computer. So, what do we do about it? Is there something I can get for that? And… about the sparkles… is that something that could get worse?
DOCTOR: Yes, dry eye is very common, and easily treatable. We can start with some over-the-counter artificial tears – I recommend a preservative-free brand. Use them as often as you need, even if your eyes don’t feel dry. I’m going to write you a prescription for Systane Ultra Preservative-Free. As for the sparkles, or what you described as “flashes,” it’s important to monitor them. While they’re currently mild, any new or worsening visual disturbances should be evaluated promptly. I’m also going to recommend a warm compress on your eyelids for 5-10 minutes once or twice a day. This can help stimulate tear production. I also want to rule out other possible causes, just to be safe. I’m going to order a simple blood test to check your blood sugar and inflammation levels. It’s a standard precaution, especially given your family history of diabetes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Artificial tears, warm compress, blood test… all right. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I'm just glad we're looking into it. Preservative-free, you said? That's good. I've heard some of those others can be irritating. And… about the blood test… do I need to fast for that? Is there anything else I should know before I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, preservative-free is best – they’re much gentler on the eyes. And yes, you do need to fast for the blood test – no food or drink for at least 8 hours beforehand, but you can still take your usual medications. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go. Here’s the form for the lab. They’re located at [Lab address/information]. I’ll also give you a prescription for the Systane Ultra Preservative-Free. I want to see you back in 6 weeks to check your progress and review the blood test results. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any new visual disturbances before then, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve been very helpful and… reassuring. It’s good to have a plan, and I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on. I appreciate your time. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you in 6 weeks. .
