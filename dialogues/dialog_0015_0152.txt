DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. They said it was a little high on the blood work. I don’t really understand what that means, to be honest. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: “A little high,” is a rather imprecise term, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: You are right about that! I just… I don't pay much attention to these things unless someone tells me there’s a problem. I work with rockets, not… bodies. So, yes, “a little high” is all I got. What is high, exactly? And should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Geho, cholesterol is a waxy substance that’s essential for building healthy cells, but too much of it can increase your risk of heart disease. There are different types. We look at your total cholesterol, your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – your HDL, the “good” cholesterol, and your triglycerides. Do you have any familiarity with those terms?
PATIENT: No, not at all. “Bad” and “good” sounds… simple enough, I guess? But I don’t know what any of the numbers mean. Or what my numbers are, for that matter. I remember the nurse saying something about a test, but she was moving so fast… could you just tell me what mine were?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s see… as of July 18th, your total cholesterol was 245 milligrams per deciliter. Your LDL was 160, your HDL was 45, and your triglycerides were 180. Those numbers are… less than optimal, to put it mildly. We generally want to see total cholesterol below 200, LDL below 100 – ideally below 70 if you have other risk factors – HDL above 60, and triglycerides below 150. Do you have any family history of heart disease, stroke, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh my. Those numbers do sound… bad. Hmm. Let me think… my father had a heart attack when he was 68, I believe. And his brother… he had a stroke, maybe ten years before that. My mother, she lived to be 92, so she was pretty healthy. But my father’s side… not so much. Is that the “risk factors” you mean? Having family with problems? And… what do we do about these numbers? Will I need medicine?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. A family history of cardiovascular disease certainly elevates your risk. And given your numbers, and your history, medication is… likely going to be necessary. However, we always start with lifestyle modifications first. We need to address your diet and exercise habits. What does a typical day of eating look like for you, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… not good, is it? Medication. Okay. As for eating… it’s probably not the best. I work long hours, Doctor. Sometimes I just grab something quick. A sandwich, maybe. Or leftovers. I like to cook when I have the time, but it doesn’t happen as often as it should. And I do enjoy a good steak now and then. Honestly? I’m not a very good cook, and takeout is easy. And I have a sweet tooth… chocolate, mostly. Is chocolate really that bad?
DOCTOR: “Not that good” is a… generous assessment, Ms. Geho. While dark chocolate in moderation can have some benefits, your overall dietary pattern appears to be contributing significantly to the problem. And I suspect your activity level is also less than ideal?
PATIENT: You are very perceptive, Doctor. Activity level… that is a polite way of saying I sit at a desk all day, and then sit on the couch all evening. I used to hike, years ago, but… work got busier, and it just sort of stopped. I do walk the dog, a little bit, but he's a small dog and doesn’t require a marathon. So, yes, not much activity. It sounds like I need a complete overhaul, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: An overhaul is… a strong term. But yes, significant changes are required. We’ll start with a referral to a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a meal plan that’s both palatable and beneficial. And I want you to begin a moderate exercise program – at least 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week. Before you start any strenuous activity, I recommend you have a baseline EKG, just to be safe. We'll schedule that now. As for medication, I’m going to start you on a low dose of atorvastatin, a statin. We’ll recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to assess its effectiveness. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life, thankfully. A statin… is that a strong drug? I always worry about side effects. And a dietitian… that sounds good. I could really use the help. Three months… that seems like a long time to wait to see if it’s working. Is there anything I should be looking out for while on the statin? Any warning signs?
DOCTOR: Statins are among the most widely prescribed medications in the world, Ms. Geho, and generally well-tolerated. However, like all medications, they can have side effects. The most common are muscle aches and pains, but those are usually mild. More serious, but rare, side effects include liver damage and an increased risk of diabetes. I’m giving you a handout that details the potential side effects and warning signs. Pay close attention to unexplained muscle weakness, tenderness, or dark urine. Contact me immediately if you experience any of those. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for three months to recheck your levels and assess your progress. Are you currently taking any other medications, even over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins, really. I’ve never been much for taking pills, as you can tell. Just the statin, then? And watch out for muscle pain. Got it. This is… a lot to take in, Doctor. But thank you for explaining it all so clearly. I appreciate that. I'll try my best. When should I start the medicine?
DOCTOR: Good. Procrastination will only exacerbate the problem. The prescription is being sent to your pharmacy now. You can start taking one 20mg tablet each evening with dinner. And I expect to see a concerted effort towards dietary changes and increased activity. I’m also sending your lab results to the dietitian’s office, so they have a starting point for your consultation. The appointment is scheduled for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Trestrail. I'll get the prescription and try to follow your instructions. Tuesday at two it is. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. See that you do. .
