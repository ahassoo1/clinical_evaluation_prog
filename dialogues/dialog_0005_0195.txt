DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, it’s not a problem, exactly. More of a… a little boost I need. My daughter, she says I should come get a “get well” card from you. She thinks it’ll cheer me up. Honestly, I don’t see what a piece of paper will do, but… she worries so.
DOCTOR: A “get well” card, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. You know, like you give someone who’s sick. But I’m not sick! Just…low. A bit down in the dumps, if you must know. My husband, he just doesn’t understand these things. He says I need to “pull myself together”. Men! They never get it. A nice card from a doctor…that would show him. And maybe give me a little…something. You know? A little lift.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, even if you don't feel sick, sometimes feeling "low" can be a sign of something going on. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a few questions, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, questions. Always questions. Alright, alright. Go ahead. But I assure you, Doctor, I'm perfectly fine. Just a bit… blah. And don’t start asking me about my eating habits. I eat perfectly good food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right, perfectly good food. Good. Well, let’s start simple. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, yes. I sleep alright. Though, I do wake up… sometimes in the middle of the night. Not because I can’t sleep, mind you. It’s usually… the noises. The neighborhood boys, they’re always shouting. And the dogs! Barking at nothing. It’s very disruptive. But I manage. I always manage. It’s not like it’s keeping me up all night. Just…interrupts things.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you are asleep, do you feel rested when you wake up?
PATIENT: Rested? Hmm. That’s a good question. Not…exactly rested. More like…relieved to be finished sleeping. You know? It’s a bit cold in the bedroom, even with the fan. Makes my joints ache a little. Old age, I suppose. Though, I’m not that old. Sixty is…middle-aged. My mother lived to ninety-two! But still…a little achey. Not enough to complain about. Usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, it’s…smaller, perhaps. Not that I don't feel like eating. It’s just…things don’t taste the same, you know? Everything is a bit…bland. My husband makes a lovely dal, but even that…needs a bit more spice. He doesn’t understand these things, either. Says I’m being fussy. Men! They have no sense of taste. But I eat. I assure you, I eat. Just…smaller portions. And I do make sure to drink plenty of water. Very important, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Energy? Oh, dear. Well, I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired! But it’s not…like I can’t do things. I still manage the house, cook, everything. But I do need to sit down more often. And I don't get out as much. My daughter, she keeps asking me to go shopping with her, but… honestly, the crowds just exhaust me. It’s easier to stay home. It's…simpler. Not that I can't go, you understand. I just…prefer not to. It's a choice. A sensible choice, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how have you been feeling emotionally lately, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Emotionally? Oh, I’m fine, Doctor. Perfectly fine. A little…pensive, perhaps. Thinking about things. Old times, mostly. My village, my family… it’s natural to be a little sad when you think about the past. But I’m not depressed, you know. I’m a strong woman. I’ve been through a lot. A little sadness doesn’t mean I’m unwell. My husband, he keeps saying I worry too much. He doesn't understand. Men! They never understand. Honestly, I just need a little…cheering up. That’s all. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? A nice card. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. I understand you're looking for a little cheer. And we will certainly get to that. But as a doctor, I do need to do a quick check-up, just to be sure everything is alright. It won’t take long. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A check-up. Well… alright. If you insist, Doctor. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. My husband checks my pulse all the time. He says I’m perfectly normal. But… alright. Go ahead. But don’t be surprised if it’s perfectly fine. And please, be quick. I have things to do. Mostly, thinking. But still. Things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 72. That's within a normal range. Let's just listen to your heart and lungs, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Normal, you say? Well, good. See? Perfectly fine. You can skip all this, Doctor. Really. But… alright. If you must. Do be gentle, though. And don’t make a fuss. I don’t like fuss. My husband always says I'm a delicate flower. Though, I’m not that delicate. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. It's undignified. Hurry up, please. The card is all I need, you know? A nice card. With flowers, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything sounds…okay. Your thyroid feels a little enlarged, but it’s not drastically so. Just a small enlargement. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Please relax. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Enlarged? Oh, dear. Well, that’s probably nothing. My mother always had a large… something. I forget what she called it. But she lived to ninety-two! So it can’t be that bad. And tender? No, nothing tender. Just…empty. I haven’t been eating much, you know? It's just... smaller portions. Like I said. But I drink plenty of water! Honestly, Doctor, I feel like you're looking for something wrong where there isn't anything. Just a little…low. That's all. And a card would really help. With a nice, cheerful message. Something about spring. Or flowers. You have cards with flowers, don’t you?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. Just a few more quick things. I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very… unnecessary. But alright. If you insist. But be gentle, please. My husband always says I'm a fragile thing. Though, I’m not that fragile. I’ve been through a lot. But… alright. Do it quickly, please. I have things to think about. And I really would like that card. With flowers, preferably. And a cheerful message. Something encouraging. My daughter would be so pleased. Honestly, she worries so much. A card would really put her mind at ease. It’s all I need, you know? Just a little…lift.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. I’ve completed the examination. I do want to be honest with you. While you say you feel “low,” I’ve noticed a few things that suggest there might be more going on. Your thyroid is slightly enlarged, your reflexes are a bit diminished, and… well, you’ve mentioned decreased appetite, changes in sleep, and fatigue. I think it would be wise to run a few blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. It’s just a routine check, nothing to worry about. It could be something simple, like a vitamin deficiency. But we need to rule out anything more serious. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests? Now you want blood tests? After all this poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I told you I’m perfectly fine! It’s just a little… blah. A little down. It’s the neighborhood boys, you know? And my husband… well, he doesn’t understand. A card would really help. Honestly, a card would be much more effective than any blood test. And it would put my daughter’s mind at ease. She worries so much. My husband, he always says I’m a drama queen. But I’m not! I just… need a little encouragement. A little lift. Honestly, I don't see what blood tests will accomplish. It's just… unnecessary. And it will probably be expensive. I'm not insured, you know. A card. That's all I need. A nice, cheerful card. With flowers. That's all. Please, Doctor? Just a card.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. I understand your concerns. And I respect your wishes. I can certainly write you a card. It will be cheerful, with flowers, as you requested. However… and this is important… I strongly recommend you consider getting a basic blood test, even just to rule things out. It doesn't have to be extensive, and we can discuss options for affordable testing. And frankly, if you do have a deficiency, addressing it could make a significant difference in how you feel. Think of it as a little…peace of mind. Would you at least be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Oh. You'll write me a card? Really? With flowers? And… you’re still going on about the blood tests? Honestly, Doctor, you’re very persistent. Alright. Alright. I’ll…consider it. But no promises. And it has to be affordable. I’m not made of money, you know. And it has to be quick. I don’t want to spend all day at the lab. And… it has to be painless. I don’t like needles. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious just thinking about it. But… I’ll consider it. But the card comes first. A nice, cheerful card. With flowers, definitely flowers. And a message about…spring. Or hope. Something encouraging. And if you could write it in a nice, flowery script…that would be lovely. Now, can we please move on? I have things to think about. And I'm starting to feel quite tired. It’s all this…poking and prodding, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. I understand. I’ll certainly write you a lovely card, with flowers and a cheerful message. Let me just… compose something appropriate. While I do that, could you tell me your daughter’s name?
PATIENT: Oh, her name is Priya. Priya Sharma. She’s a very good daughter. She worries too much, but she means well. She’s always trying to get me to take care of myself, you know? Get enough rest, eat healthy… Honestly, sometimes it’s exhausting. But… she loves me. And she’s very proud of me. She always says I’m a strong woman. But… a card would really put her mind at ease. It would make her so happy. And it would give me something nice to show my husband. To prove to him that I’m not just…being dramatic. Honestly, it’s all very complicated. But a card would really help. Yes, a card would really help. Please, make it a nice one. With lots of flowers. And a cheerful message. Something about hope. Or springtime. Or… something encouraging. Yes. That would be lovely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. Here you are. I hope this brings you some cheer. “Dear Priya, your mother is a remarkable woman, filled with strength and resilience. Please encourage her to rest and take care of herself, and remind her that her well-being is of utmost importance. Wishing you both health and happiness. Sincerely, Dr. Cabel Donate.” I also wrote a little note to encourage you to prioritize rest. And, if you do decide to consider blood tests, we can definitely discuss affordable options. But for now… I hope you enjoy the card. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… very nice. Thank you, Doctor. Priya will be so happy to see this. She’s always so worried. And… you wrote a note about rest? Well, I do try to rest. When I can. But the neighborhood boys… and my husband… it’s difficult. But… thank you. Yes, thank you very much. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just…thank you. You’ve been very kind. A little persistent, perhaps, but… kind. And the card is lovely. Very lovely. Priya will be so pleased. Yes, she will be very pleased. Well, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. And… goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Micucci. And you’re welcome to come back anytime. Take care of yourself, and please, do think about prioritizing your well-being. Goodbye, Ms. Micucci.
PATIENT: Goodbye, Doctor. And…thank you again.
