DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, well… my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you understand? More like… a squeezing. It feels… tight. Like someone is sitting on my chest, maybe? It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: A squeezing, tight feeling… and when did you first notice this, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday. My grandson, Mateo, came to visit. We were… playing dominoes. And then… after a little while, I felt it. Not during the game, but after we finished, when I was getting up from the table. It wasn’t bad bad, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: And has it been constant since Tuesday, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not constant! Definitely comes and goes. It’s… worse when I walk fast. Or… climb the stairs. My little garden… I have to stop a few times now to catch my breath. But when I’m sitting, resting… it’s usually okay. Mostly. Sometimes I feel it just a little bit even when I’m quiet, but it's not so strong. You understand?
DOCTOR: So, it's exertional… worse with activity and relieved with rest. Any pain radiating anywhere – your arm, jaw, back?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes! Sometimes… my left arm. Not all the way down, just… my shoulder and up near my elbow. It doesn’t feel like a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And… now that you mention it, a little bit in my jaw too. But only sometimes. It's hard to explain, Doctor. It's not always there. Is that… bad? I worry too much, maybe.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, worrying is understandable when you're experiencing these symptoms. We need to rule some things out. Have you ever had anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never! Not like this. I’ve had… little aches and pains, like any old lady. But never… this squeezing. My mother… she had problems with her heart, a long time ago. But it was different. She… she couldn’t breathe when she laid down. This isn’t like that. It’s… different. I hope it’s not like hers.
DOCTOR: Family history of heart problems is important. Do you currently have any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… The doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so he gave me a pill. I take it every day. A little white one. And… I think he said something about my cholesterol being a bit high too, but I can't remember exactly. I go to the doctor regularly, but I forget things, you know? Is that the important part? The blood pressure pill?
DOCTOR: The pill is important, yes. What's the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s the hard part. I have the bottle at home, but I… I don't remember the name! It's a little white pill, like I said. And… it has letters on it. I think… maybe an "A"? Or a "V"? I really can't recall, Doctor. I'm so sorry. I should have written it down. My husband usually keeps track of these things. He's at the market right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to figure it out. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for headaches, and… little aches. Nothing ever bothered me. I’m a pretty healthy lady, usually. Just… this chest pain is worrying me. I don’t like it at all. It makes me feel… scared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, we'll need to do a quick EKG to see what's happening. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. My heart… I just want to make sure it's okay. An EKG… is that painful? I don’t like needles, you know. But I trust you. Whatever you need to do. Please just be gentle.
DOCTOR: It's not painful at all, Ms. Chelberg. It just involves placing some stickers on your chest. Now, if you'll please lie back on the examination table… Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here I go. Deep breath… Is that okay? I try to breathe deeply, but sometimes… it feels hard.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a little faint. And I do hear some mild crackling in your lower lungs. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relaxed… I am trying. This cuff… it squeezes a little, doesn’t it? It makes my arm feel funny. But I'm trying to be still. Is that better? Should I breathe? Or not breathe? I always forget.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And your pulse is 88, also a bit on the higher side. Now, we’ll need to do that EKG. It will only take a few minutes. The technician, Maria, will be in shortly to apply the stickers. Do you have any jewelry on your chest that needs to be removed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just this little necklace. My husband gave it to me… a long time ago. It’s not very valuable, but I always wear it. Maria, you say? She sounds nice. I hope she’s gentle with the stickers. I don't like things stuck to my skin.
DOCTOR: Maria is very gentle, Ms. Chelberg. Don't worry. While we wait for her, let's talk a little more about your symptoms. You mentioned the pain radiates to your jaw. Does anything specifically trigger that pain, or is it just there when the chest pain is present?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. I think… it’s when I’m walking fast, and my chest is tight, that’s when my jaw starts to ache. Not always, but mostly. And… sometimes when I’m climbing the stairs. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like my whole face is tired, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a toothache, you understand? It’s… different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any nausea, sweating, or shortness of breath without exertion?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no nausea. And I haven’t been sweating… unless it’s just from the heat, you know? It’s very warm today. But… sometimes, when I lay down to rest, I feel a little… breathless. Not like I can’t breathe at all, but like… I need to sit up to catch my breath. It happens sometimes, not every time. Is that bad, Doctor? I worry I’m bothering you with all this…
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, you’re not bothering me at all. It’s important to get a complete picture of what’s going on. The fact that you experience shortness of breath when lying down, along with the chest pain, jaw discomfort, and radiating pain to your arm, is concerning. Maria should be here any moment. We’re going to get this EKG done, and then we can discuss the results and determine the next steps. I want you to know that we need to rule out a possible cardiac issue.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Cardiac issue… That sounds… serious. My mother… she had a bad heart, you know. Is that what you think it might be? I’m getting a little scared now, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is it something serious? Will I… will I need to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, I understand your concern, and it's perfectly natural to be scared. I'm not saying it is a cardiac issue, but it's important we investigate the possibility. The EKG will give us some valuable information. It's better to be cautious and rule things out. If, after the EKG, I feel it's necessary, we may need to do some further testing, and potentially a referral to a cardiologist. Whether or not that means a hospital stay depends entirely on the results. Let’s just focus on getting this EKG done first, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. An EKG… and then… we’ll see. You’re right. Let’s just do the EKG. Maria… you said her name was Maria? I hope she’s gentle. I’m ready, I think. Just… tell me what she’s going to do, so I’m not surprised. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. Maria will be in shortly. She will simply be placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. These stickers are connected to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all – it’s completely painless. She'll need to briefly expose your chest to attach the stickers. It will take about five minutes. She’ll explain everything as she goes. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all, Ms. Chelberg. Here she comes now.
