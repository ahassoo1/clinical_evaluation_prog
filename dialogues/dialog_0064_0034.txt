DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here. New to the area and, I guess, gotta get things set up? Like, for healthcare and stuff. I think my husband said something about a check-up? I don’t really… remember all the details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. Getting settled in a new place can be a bit overwhelming. A check-up is a great place to start. It’s good to establish care, even if you’re feeling well. So, besides establishing care, is there anything specific you're concerned about today?
PATIENT: Specific…? Not really, I don’t think so. I mean, I feel okay. Everything feels… normal? I just wanted to make sure everything is normal, I guess. Like, get a once-over, if that makes sense? I'm not sure what they usually do for these things…
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. A ‘once-over’ is a good way to put it. We’ll do a basic physical exam, check your vital signs – things like your blood pressure and heart rate – and I’ll ask you a few questions about your medical history and any symptoms you might be experiencing. To start, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Um… general health… I work, you know, with machines. It’s kinda physical, but not too bad. I guess I walk around a lot. And I… I try to eat okay? My husband's a good cook. I don't really… get sick much? I had a cold last winter, I think, but that was… a while ago. Everything else… I don’t really pay much attention, if that makes sense. I mostly just… do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like you’re generally active and eat reasonably well. That's a good foundation. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me if you have any ongoing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I mean, nobody’s ever told me I have anything. My husband might know? He handles a lot of… paperwork and stuff. I’m not very good with remembering things like that. I definitely don't have… diabetes, I don't think? That sounds serious. I don’t usually take any medicine, except… sometimes for headaches? Just over-the-counter stuff, like ibuprofen. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is good to know about any medications you take, even over-the-counter ones. Ibuprofen is fine occasionally, but frequent use can sometimes have side effects. No worries, we'll discuss that later if needed. Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… I think… when I was little, I had my tonsils out? A long, long time ago. And… maybe my appendix? It was a blur, honestly. I don’t remember much about it. And… no, I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital since then. Not that I recall. It’s all kinda fuzzy. Sorry, I’m not very helpful with this stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. These things can be difficult to recall, especially if they happened a long time ago. We have your medical records here, so hopefully, we can fill in some of the gaps. Now, a quick question about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mom… she had… something with her heart? I think. She was always tired. And my grandpa, on my dad's side… he had cancer, I think. Lung cancer? It was a long time ago. And… I don't really know much else, honestly. My family isn't very good at talking about stuff like that. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… not something we ever really discussed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s common for families to not discuss medical history openly. Knowing about heart issues and cancer is a good start though. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don’t smoke. I don't really like the smell. And I don't drink. Makes me feel sick. And… well, I just don't do any of that stuff. My husband doesn't either. So, no, not at all. Never have.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I’m outside, but that’s probably just bugs? Nothing serious. No food allergies, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine that I recall. Sorry, I'm really not much help with this stuff. I just don't usually think about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. You're doing great. It sounds like you don’t have any known allergies, which is good. Okay, so we've covered quite a bit of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and looking in your ears and throat. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I'm not really good with… doctors stuff. But I guess if I gotta do it, I gotta do it. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Can you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Okay… Is this gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all, Emileigh. It just feels a little tight around your arm for a moment. Just relax. Okay, your blood pressure is 122/78, which is perfectly normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… Is everything okay? It feels kinda weird when you listen to my chest.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, which is also normal. Your lungs sound clear and open on both sides. No wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Your ears look clear as well. No signs of infection or fluid. And now, I'll just take a quick look in your throat. Your throat looks healthy, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good so far.
PATIENT: Okay… that tickles. Everything’s good, huh? Even though I can’t really… tell? Is that a good thing? I always get nervous at the doctor. I’m probably just being silly.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is good, Emileigh. And you’re not being silly at all. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous at the doctor! And you’re right, it’s hard to tell when everything’s working as it should, that’s why we do these checks. Based on what we’ve discussed and the brief exam, you appear to be in good health. However, given your recent move, it might be a good idea to run some basic blood work to get a baseline and make sure everything is optimal. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Like… needles? I… I don’t really like needles. But… if it’s important, I guess. If you think it’s a good idea. I just… don’t wanna pass out or anything. Would it be a lot?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be nervous about needles, Emileigh. Many people feel the same way. It will just be a small amount of blood drawn, just enough for some routine tests – things like checking your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We’ll have a nurse do it, and they're very experienced at making it as comfortable as possible. It will be quick, and we’ll have you lie down if you’re worried about feeling faint. Would you like me to explain what the tests are for in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… explain it? If that helps. I just… I don’t understand all that medical stuff. What’s cholesterol? And what do kidneys do? I feel kinda silly asking all these questions. It’s just… my husband usually handles all this stuff.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Emileigh. It’s perfectly fine to ask questions – that’s what I’m here for. Okay, so cholesterol is a type of fat that's found in your blood. We need some cholesterol to stay healthy, but too much can build up and cause problems with your heart. That's why we check it – to make sure your levels are within a healthy range. Your kidneys are like filters for your blood. They remove waste and extra fluid from your body. Checking your kidney function helps us make sure they're working properly. Basically, these tests just give us a snapshot of your overall health and help us catch any potential problems early on. It's preventative care, and it's a good idea to get a baseline now that you've moved. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… cholesterol is like, a bad fat? And kidneys are filters… like for a car? So, you're just making sure everything's working okay? Like… a check-up for my insides? That… that makes a little more sense. If it’s just a check-up, I guess I can do it. But please, tell the nurse I get nervous, okay? And maybe… maybe I should lie down? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Emileigh. That's a perfect way to put it – a check-up for your insides. And absolutely, I will definitely tell the nurse you get nervous. She’s very kind and understanding. And yes, lying down is an excellent idea – it’s always better to be safe. So, let's get you set up with the nurse. She'll call you back in a few minutes. She will draw a small amount of blood, and we'll have the results back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss them and create a plan to keep you healthy. Is there anything else I can answer for you before I let the nurse come in?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel silly. I usually just get overwhelmed at the doctor. But… you made it a little easier. I guess… I'll just wait for the nurse then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. And please, don't hesitate to ask any questions that come to mind, even after you’ve left the clinic. Alright, I’ll let you rest for a moment and the nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
