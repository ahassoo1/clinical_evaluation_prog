DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. It is about… the words. They do not come so easy now. It is… frustrating, yes? I try to speak, and… they are lost. Like… fog in my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds… unsettling, to say the least. Frustrating is a good word for it. So, this difficulty with finding the right words… when did you first start noticing this, Sherrell?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It… it was some time ago now. Not suddenly, you understand. More… slowly. Perhaps… six months? Or was it eight? It is difficult to say exactly. Things… blur. I do remember it being worse after… after my wife, Ingrid, passed. But before that too, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset, roughly six to eight months ago, possibly worsened after the loss of your wife… I'm very sorry for your loss, by the way. That must have been incredibly difficult. And it was present to some degree even beforehand?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it was. A great emptiness. And yes, you are correct. Even before… sometimes I would search for a word, a common word, and it would… elude me. Not often, but enough to notice. It was not so… alarming then. Now… it is more frequent, and… I worry. It makes simple conversations… difficult. And I like to talk. I used to enjoy a good debate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent enough now to be concerning, and impacting your ability to communicate. You mentioned enjoying debate… so it’s affecting complex thought and simple conversation?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… a good way to put it. Not just little words. Big ideas too. I was reading an article… about… politics, I think? And I wanted to form an argument, to think it through… but the words… they were not there. It felt like… trying to grasp smoke. It is… unsettling. And sometimes, when I do say something, I am not sure it makes sense. My son… he looks at me with… concern.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is causing you a good deal of anxiety, and that's perfectly understandable. We need to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I do… sometimes I feel more tired. Not… sick tired, but… heavy. Like a weight. And my memory… it is not what it was. I forget things… appointments, names… little things. Though, perhaps that is just age, yes? I am not so young anymore. But I… I worry it is more than that. Ingrid always said I had a good memory. She would test me on… history facts. I could always remember them. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some memory issues alongside the word-finding difficulties. It’s good you’re noticing these things and bringing them to my attention. It's important to rule things out. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, headaches, weakness, or numbness?
PATIENT: Hmm… vision… no, I do not think so. Though, I should probably get it checked, yes? It has been a while. Headaches… sometimes, a little one, but nothing severe. Weakness… no. And numbness… no, nothing like that. I still walk every day, you see. A long walk in the fields. I enjoy that. Ingrid liked to join me, when she was able. It keeps me… active. I do not feel… weak. Just… tired, sometimes. And… forgetful. But not… physically weak. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No vision changes, no headaches, no weakness or numbness. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm... medical conditions... Let me think. I have… my blood pressure, it is sometimes a little high. The doctor… a different doctor, before… put me on a small pill for it. I take it every morning. And… my knees, they bother me sometimes. Old age, I suppose. Arthritis, maybe? I do not go to the doctor often. I prefer to… manage things myself, if possible. Ingrid… she was the one who always went to the doctor. She was very… careful. I am not so good at remembering appointments, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some knee pain. And you haven't been to the doctor regularly. Okay. Any past surgeries or hospitalizations I should know about?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries... Let me think carefully. Ingrid… she had a surgery on her… her hip, many years ago. I was with her, of course. But me? No, I do not think so. No surgeries. Hospitalizations… once, when I was a boy. I fell from a tree. Broke my arm. But that was… a very long time ago. Nothing since. I have been… quite healthy, all my life, really. Until… recently, of course. This… with the words. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: No surgeries or hospitalizations, other than a broken arm as a child. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is… difficult. Ingrid’s family… they were mostly healthy, I believe. Her mother lived to a good age. But my family… my father… he had… problems with his memory, when he got older. Not like me, not yet. But… forgetful. And my grandmother… she had… I believe it was dementia, yes? That is what they called it. It is… not a pleasant thing, I remember. She did not recognize anyone at the end. It is… a worry, of course. I hope it is not that. I really do.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of memory problems in your father and dementia in your grandmother. That's important information. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think carefully. Just the small pill for my blood pressure, as far as I know. Sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take… a small tablet, for the pain. But not every day. Only when it is… particularly bad. And… sometimes a vitamin. Vitamin D, I think. The doctor… the other doctor… suggested it. But that is… it. Just the blood pressure pill, sometimes the knee tablet, and occasionally the vitamin. I do not like to take many pills, you see. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. But the blood pressure… that is important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, just to get a better sense of things. It’s nothing to worry about, just a routine check. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam—just some simple tests of your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A physical examination… yes, that is fine. I… I would like to know what is happening, if possible. I do not like to be… in the dark, you see. So… yes, please. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, if you would. My knees are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sherrell. We'll take things slowly and be as gentle as possible. First, let's just check your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am trying to relax. It is… difficult sometimes, when I am worried. But I will try. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Not alarmingly so, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Deep breaths, please. In and out. Everything sounds… normal. No unusual sounds there. Now, let's just do a few simple tests to check your reflexes and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will try. Is that… alright? It is a little… difficult to focus sometimes, you see. My eyes… they are not what they used to be. But I am trying my best.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Sherrell. No need to strain. Now, just relax your arms. I’m just going to tap a little bit here and here. Now, could you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that… correct? It feels a little… strange, you see. I am not very good at this. My coordination… it is not what it used to be. Perhaps I am just… nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It's perfectly normal to feel a little off when you're being examined. I’m just noting a slight slowing of your movements and some difficulty with coordination. Nothing terribly concerning at this stage, but something we need to investigate further. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Second, an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any structural problems. And finally, a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds reasonable. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I… I want to know what is happening, you see. I do not want to… be in the dark. An MRI… is that… painful? And a cognitive assessment… will it be difficult? I do not want to… fail, you see. I just… want to know. Yes, please. Order the tests. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. An MRI isn't painful, it's just a little noisy and you'll need to lie very still for a while. And the cognitive assessment is just a series of simple questions and tasks—it's not a test to pass or fail, just a way to get a better understanding of your cognitive abilities. It’s important to remember that everyone performs differently, and the results will help us determine the best course of action. Alright, I'm ordering those tests now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and we'll get you scheduled for the MRI as soon as possible. I’ll also have the nurse set up the cognitive assessment for you here in the clinic. In the meantime, I'd like to discuss some initial strategies to help manage your symptoms. It may be helpful to keep a daily journal to track your word-finding difficulties and any potential triggers. And I also recommend avoiding stressful situations as much as possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A journal… that sounds… sensible. To write down the words… when they elude me. And avoiding stress… yes, that is… good advice. Though, it is difficult sometimes. But I will try. I really will. Thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little better now, knowing that we are doing something. Yes, a journal. And I will try to avoid stress. Thank you. Is there… anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. For now, focus on the journal and stress reduction. It's also important to stay physically active, as that's good for your brain health. And make sure to get plenty of rest. One more thing: if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll review the results of the tests as soon as they’re available and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. The nurse will provide you with some information about the tests and how to prepare for them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is everything. You have… explained everything so clearly. I feel… less anxious now. A little worried, of course, but… less anxious. Thank you. I will… write in my journal. And I will try to avoid stress. Thank you… very much. I believe I am ready to go now?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a good start, Sherrell. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your tests. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. It was a pleasure meeting you. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are… very kind. I appreciate your… reassurance. I will… see you soon, I hope. .
DOCTOR: You as well, Sherrell. We’ll be in touch. Take care.
