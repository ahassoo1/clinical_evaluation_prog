DOCTOR: Bula! And hello there. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you, Reneisha. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about my weight, actually. I’ve gained some, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It’s quite bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're addressing this, Reneisha. Weight changes can be frustrating, and it's definitely something we can look into. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how much weight you’ve gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Let me see… It started, I believe, around November of last year. Perhaps October. And… approximately fifteen pounds, maybe a little more. I weigh myself every other week, usually, and it’s been a steady climb. It's… unusual for me. I haven’t changed my eating habits, not intentionally, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly six months, and around fifteen pounds. And you haven’t made any conscious changes to your diet. That’s helpful to know. And have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it, yes. I’ve been… more tired, generally. And a little… colder, even when the weather isn’t particularly cool. My husband has noticed I sleep more deeply as well, he says I’m harder to wake. It’s not severe, mind you, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, feeling colder than usual, and deeper sleep. Those are all things we want to explore. Before we move on, could you tell me a bit about your typical day?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an orderly at the hospital, you see. It’s…a lot of walking, lifting, assisting patients. Usually a twelve-hour shift, three days a week. The rest of the time, I keep house, garden a little, spend time with my husband. We don’t have children. It's a quiet life, generally. I try to eat a good, balanced meal when I can, but sometimes it’s just…convenient things, you know? Leftovers, sandwiches.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – life gets busy, and convenience often wins. Okay, so a physically demanding job three days a week, and then quieter days at home. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not really… I don’t feel hungrier than usual, no. It’s just…everything seems to be sticking a little more, if that makes sense. I don't feel full as quickly, but I’m not actively seeking out more food. It's…difficult to explain. Like my body is holding onto everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a really helpful description – feeling like your body is holding onto everything. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like thyroid problems, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I've been quite healthy, thankfully, all my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve never had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than a routine check-up. My husband keeps telling me I worry too much, but this weight gain is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – no prior medical conditions or surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had… some issues with her joints, arthritis, later in life. My father was healthy until a heart attack, quite suddenly, when he was seventy-two. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes, but she didn’t take very good care of herself, if I’m honest. A lot of sweets, not much exercise. That's about it, really. No one else that I can recall with similar problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart attack in your father, and diabetes in your grandmother. And what about medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Not even over-the-counter things, unless I have a headache, perhaps. And even then, it’s very rare. I prefer to…manage things naturally, if I can. This is why I'm concerned about the weight gain, it’s completely out of the ordinary for me. I haven't changed anything!
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I haven't had any allergic reactions that I know of. My husband does have some hay fever in the spring, but I don't share that problem. I've always been able to eat anything and everything without issue. Which, again, makes this weight gain all the more perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That sounds…sensible. I'm ready whenever you are. I do hope you can find something to explain this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 128/82, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Everything looks within the normal range so far. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules detected. It’s not tender to the touch. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Your reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Skin is warm, dry, and normal in color. No rashes or lesions detected. I'm going to listen to your heart sounds again. I do notice a slightly slower than normal rate. It’s subtle, but worth noting. It's about 60 beats per minute. Okay. Based on the exam, everything is relatively normal, but that slightly slower heart rate, along with the weight gain and fatigue, makes me want to order some blood tests.
PATIENT: Blood tests? What are you looking for, Doctor? I confess, I'm a little anxious now. Is it something serious? I feel perfectly alright, apart from the weight and tiredness. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Reneisha, and I want to reassure you that we're just gathering information at this point. The blood tests will help us rule out a few things. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3 – to see if your thyroid is functioning normally, even though the physical exam didn’t reveal any obvious abnormalities. I also want to check a complete blood count – CBC – to look for any signs of anemia or infection. And finally, I'll order a basic metabolic panel – BMP – to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. These tests can help us identify potential causes for your symptoms and ensure we get you the right treatment. It’s possible it’s nothing, and we’ll just have to wait for the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. Thyroid hormones, blood count… and something about my kidneys? Yes, I suppose so. It's just… a lot. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? I really do prefer to avoid fasting if at all possible. I find it makes me rather lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll try to minimize any inconvenience. For these tests, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand – no food or drinks other than water. I apologize for that, but it’s essential for accurate results. As for when you can expect them, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process everything, so we should have the results by Thursday. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to avoid stressing too much. It's important to keep yourself hydrated and try to get regular, moderate exercise, if you are up to it. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Thursday… alright. And no food, only water. I can manage that, I suppose. Hydration and exercise… yes, I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel… slightly less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Is there anything else I should be aware of, before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. No, I don’t think there's anything else at this point. Just try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity until we have the test results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue – please don't hesitate to call the clinic, or go to the nearest emergency room. The nurse will give you a printed sheet with instructions about the fasting and a list of symptoms to watch out for. And, of course, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before Thursday. Here’s a lab requisition. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you. The lab is quite close, just a short bus ride away. My husband usually drives me if the weather is bad, but I can manage it myself. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and patience with all my questions. It's very reassuring. I think… I think that’s all for now. I shall await the nurse’s call on Thursday. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you have a good rest of your day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything concerns you. Bula vinaka – all the best! .
