DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay. A lump in your lower abdomen. And how long is “a little while now,” exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about six weeks, maybe a little longer. It didn’t bother me at first, just felt… different. But it hasn’t gone away, and it feels a bit bigger now, so I decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Alright, six weeks. Has the size change been gradual, or did you notice it get noticeably bigger all at once?
PATIENT: It’s been gradual, I think. Not a sudden change, thankfully. It’s just… slowly getting more noticeable when I lie down, you know? It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s definitely there now.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual growth, not painful. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is it located?
PATIENT: If you don't mind me being specific… it’s on my right side, a little below my belly button. Not right on the belly button, but a few inches to the right. It’s hard to describe perfectly.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side, a few inches below the belly button. And would you describe it as a soft lump, or hard?
PATIENT: It’s… not rock hard, definitely. More… firm, I suppose? It has a little give when I press on it, but it’s not squishy. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Firm, with some give. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I’ve connected to it, anyway. No pain, no fever, no changes in… well, you know, my bathroom habits. Just the lump itself. I haven’t felt any weaker or more tired than usual, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms. And have you had any recent injuries to that area?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing that I can recall. I haven’t done anything to hurt myself down there. I'm not a very active person, to be honest, so I'm unlikely to have injured it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I'm generally healthy. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. I don’t have any major illnesses, like diabetes or heart problems. I did have my appendix out when I was younger, maybe twenty years ago, but that was it. Otherwise, just the usual colds and flu.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed twenty years ago, otherwise healthy. Any surgeries besides the appendix?
PATIENT: No, sir, just the appendix. Nothing else. And I don’t take any regular medications, just over-the-counter things when I need them – pain relievers for headaches, that sort of thing. My wife keeps reminding me to take a daily vitamin, but I'm not very good at remembering.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries or medications. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when I go to the doctor, and I always say no. I think she worries more about my health than I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of cancer or other significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had… well, she had some stomach problems when she was older, but the doctors never said it was cancer. My father was healthy as a horse, lived to be 90. As far as I know, there’s no history of cancer in the family, but I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant family history of cancer that you're aware of. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm married, as I mentioned. I work as a choreographer, mostly with local dance groups. It keeps me busy, but it’s not physically strenuous. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat a healthy diet, but my wife does most of the cooking, and I'm not always the best at resisting sweets. I don't exercise regularly, I'm afraid. Mostly just walking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. I think I have a good understanding of your history now. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table for me, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I’ll gently feel around to examine the lump. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m listening for any unusual sounds… Sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Okay… I feel a firm mass on your right side, about two inches below your belly button. It’s not tender to the touch, which is good. It's approximately 3 centimeters in diameter and appears to be mobile. I don't feel any rebound tenderness or guarding. It doesn't seem to be connected to the underlying tissue. I'm going to check your lymph nodes now. Your lymph nodes don't seem enlarged. Okay. That's all for the physical exam. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests.
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. What kind of tests are you thinking, Doctor? I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. I want to be thorough. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and rule out any signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan will give us a detailed image of the mass, its size, shape, and location, and help us determine if it's a benign growth, a cyst, or something else. Do you have any issues with kidney function?
PATIENT: Kidney function? No, not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have any problems with my kidneys. I drink plenty of water, and I've never had any pain in my back or anything like that. Is the contrast something I should be worried about? I've heard things about reactions to contrast dye.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The contrast dye helps us get a clearer image on the CT scan. It’s usually very safe, but it can cause a mild allergic reaction in some people, or it can temporarily affect kidney function if your kidneys aren’t working at their best. Since you’ve never had any kidney problems, the risk is likely low, but we'll ask you some questions before the scan to make sure you're a good candidate. They’ll also give you fluids before and after to help your kidneys flush out the dye. Do you have any allergies to iodine or shellfish?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to iodine or shellfish. My wife makes a lovely shrimp scampi, and I enjoy it without any issues. I'm still a little worried, Doctor, but I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. When will I be able to schedule these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No shellfish or iodine allergies. That’s reassuring. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for blood work tomorrow morning, first thing. And we'll get the CT scan scheduled for later this week, probably Friday. They’ll call you to confirm the exact time. I want to emphasize that these tests are just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve made me feel a lot better. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll go to the nurse now to schedule the tests. .
