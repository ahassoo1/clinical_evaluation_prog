DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here about a cruise I’m planning, and they’ve asked me to get some information from a doctor before I go. It’s mostly just a formality, I think, but better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A sensible precaution. Very good. Could you tell me a little more about the cruise?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s a ten-day trip around the Mediterranean, leaving on the 15th of September. It’s with… let me see… Majestic Voyages. It’s a bit fancy, actually. I haven’t been on a proper cruise before, mostly just day trips. They sent me a rather long form with lots of questions about my health, and this request for a doctor’s note was at the end. It asks about any conditions I have, or medications I take.
DOCTOR: Yes, Majestic Voyages… I’ve heard of them. Ten days is a lovely length of time. And you’re quite right to be thorough. Let’s work through this form, shall we?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible. I brought a list, actually, just to be sure I didn’t forget anything. It’s just things like… well, I had a bout of the flu last winter, and my ankles do swell a bit if I stand for too long. Nothing too serious, mind you.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We’ll take it one step at a time. The flu is good to know. And the ankle swelling… Is that a recent development, or has that been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Thank you. The ankle swelling… oh, it’s been going on for years, really. It flares up more when it’s hot, or if I’ve been doing a lot of walking. It’s never been properly looked at, though. I just wear support stockings, and it usually does the trick. I wouldn’t say it’s a problem, exactly. More of an… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’ve found something that helps manage it. To be certain, and just for documentation, have you noticed any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not usually, no. Sometimes a little bit of aching if I've been on my feet all day, but nothing I’d call pain. More of a… heaviness, really. And it goes away when I put my feet up. I do a lot of standing at work, you see. I’m a merchandise displayer – window trimming mostly. It’s quite creative, but it can be tiring.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, but I can see how that would contribute to the swelling. Alright. And apart from the flu and the ankle swelling, are there any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but I’ve never had any trouble with it since. And I wear glasses, of course. Nothing major, really. I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I lost my husband five years ago, and I think that was harder on me than anything physical.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's good to know about the gallbladder removal. And I’m very sorry for your loss. It's important to take care of all aspects of your health, especially after a difficult time. Let's move on to medications, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but it’s not regular. And I have some ibuprofen in the house for headaches, but I rarely use it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking anything if I can. My mother always said, “Too much medicine will do you more harm than good!”
DOCTOR: Wise words from your mother. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with insect bites or anything like that. Oh, wait… I think I might have a mild sensitivity to strong perfumes, but it’s just a bit of a sniffle, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the perfume sensitivity. That’s helpful. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother lived to be 85, and she was quite healthy until the very end. My father died younger, in his 70s, from a heart condition. He smoked, you see. And my brother is perfectly well, as far as I know. No major illnesses on either side, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I live alone in a small cottage just outside of town. I enjoy gardening, mostly flowers. I do a bit of walking, but not as much as I used to. I enjoy reading and… well, I try to keep busy. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I eat a reasonably healthy diet, mostly home-cooked meals. I suppose I’m fairly sedentary these days, if I’m honest. Work keeps me on my feet some, but it’s not exactly strenuous exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. This is very helpful. Now, if you'll excuse me for just a moment, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I wouldn’t want you to miss anything. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ankle swelling is present bilaterally, but not pitting significantly. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Throat is clear, ears are normal. Overall, your physical exam appears normal, Ms. Squiers. The ankle swelling is consistent with your history.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. I’m glad everything seems to be alright. So, what does all this mean for my cruise, Doctor? Do you think I’m fit to travel?
DOCTOR: Based on your history and the physical exam, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t be able to enjoy your cruise, Ms. Squiers. However, I do recommend a few things. First, stay well-hydrated, especially in the warmer climate. Second, be mindful of prolonged standing, and continue wearing support stockings if they help with the swelling. And third, if you experience any unusual symptoms while on the cruise—such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your ankles—seek medical attention immediately. I’ll provide you with a summary of these recommendations in writing. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That all sounds very sensible, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t think I do, actually. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your time and your reassurance. This has put my mind at ease. And thank you for the written summary - that will be very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. Here's the summary. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions. I wish you a wonderful and safe cruise! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything, thank you. You’ve been very kind and helpful, Doctor Pirl. I’m very grateful. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. You have a wonderful time on your cruise as well. Please take care. .
