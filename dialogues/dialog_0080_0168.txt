DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I’m seeking… guidance. I’ve recently begun seeing someone, and, well, one must be thorough, mustn’t one? A checkup before things become… serious. It’s simply prudent.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela, that’s very responsible of you. A general check-up is always a good idea, especially with new changes in your life. So, “thorough” – let's start with that. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted this visit, or is this more of a preventative measure?
PATIENT: Preventative, primarily. Though… now that you mention it, there is a slight matter. My energy levels haven’t been quite what they used to be. Nothing debilitating, you understand. Just… a certain lack of pep. I attribute it to the stress of… modern life, of course. But one can’t be too careful. And frankly, I expect a certain… vigor in a companion. It’s a reasonable expectation, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re bringing this up. Fatigue can have a lot of causes, and it's definitely worth investigating. When did you start noticing this decrease in energy?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it began approximately three months ago. Coincidentally, around the time I met Mr. Henderson. Not that I’m implying any… correlation, you understand. Simply stating a timeline. It’s a gradual decline, really. I used to be quite the gardener, you see. Now, even weeding feels… arduous. And the social engagements! One simply must maintain a certain level of activity, but it’s becoming… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, coinciding with meeting Mr. Henderson. And it’s impacting your gardening and social life. Has anything else changed around that time besides starting a new relationship?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, the bakery down the street changed ownership. Dreadful pastries now, simply dreadful. Though, I doubt that’s relevant. Oh! And my book club switched to reading… contemporary novels. Utterly lacking in substance, of course. No, nothing else of consequence. Just… minor irritations. It’s the energy, Doctor. That’s the crux of the matter. It’s simply… not there. And frankly, it reflects poorly, doesn’t it? A woman must present a certain… vitality.
DOCTOR: I understand, Esthela. It sounds like you're very aware of your overall well-being and how you present yourself. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I generally rise at 7:00 AM, though not before ensuring my hair is perfectly arranged. Breakfast is a small portion of fruit and a single, high-quality biscotti. Then, I dedicate an hour to correspondence – thank you notes are simply essential. Afterwards, I’ll tend to my garden, or, presently, attempt to. Lunch is a light salad. The afternoon is reserved for social calls or engagements, though, as I mentioned, they’re becoming rather taxing. Dinner is a small portion of fish and steamed vegetables. And finally, I read for an hour before retiring for the night. A very structured existence, you see. It’s simply the most… efficient way to live. Although, admittedly, even maintaining the structure is becoming… challenging.
DOCTOR: That is a very structured day, Esthela. And it sounds… demanding, even if it’s self-imposed. Do you get much physical activity beyond gardening?
PATIENT: Physical activity? Well, I do walk to the market on Tuesdays. It's a rather brisk pace, naturally. One mustn't dawdle. And I occasionally take a gentle stroll through the park, admiring the landscaping. Though, truthfully, the upkeep these days is simply appalling. It's all rather… common. No, I wouldn't characterize my lifestyle as particularly… strenuous. It's more about maintaining appearances, you see. And, of course, intellectual stimulation. I do try to engage in stimulating conversation whenever possible. Though, admittedly, that’s becoming increasingly… difficult. People simply lack… depth these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how is your sleep?
PATIENT: My sleep is… adequate. I require a very specific pillow, naturally – down, with a silk casing. And the room must be precisely dark. No stray light whatsoever. I generally manage seven hours, though it’s not always… restful. I tend to ruminate, you see. Over… matters of importance. The state of society, the decline of etiquette, the appalling quality of modern art… things of that nature. It’s not insomnia, precisely. Just… a thoughtful night. And, frankly, it leaves me feeling rather… depleted in the morning. Although, one must persevere, mustn’t one? A woman has standards, you see. Even when exhausted.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me consider… My digestion has been… less predictable, shall we say. Nothing alarming, merely… inconsistent. And my complexion… well, it lacks its usual… radiance. I attribute it to stress, naturally. Maintaining a social calendar is exhausting. And my appetite… it fluctuates. Some days I have a reasonable appetite, others… merely a few bites. And, oh! I've been rather… forgetful lately. Small things, you understand. Where I placed my spectacles, the name of a particular acquaintance… nothing significant. Though, it’s… unsettling. A woman prides herself on her memory, you see. It’s simply… uncharacteristic. It’s all rather… distressing, truthfully. Is this… normal, Doctor? Is this what happens when one… engages with the modern world?
DOCTOR: Those are all good things to mention, Esthela, and I appreciate you being so thorough. It doesn’t sound like anything definitively concerning, but it is helpful to have the full picture. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Medications? Only a very small dose of potassium, prescribed by my previous physician for… a slight irregularity. It’s barely noticeable. As for allergies… I have a rather sensitive reaction to cheap perfume. Anything synthetic, really. It gives me an immediate headache. And I’m mildly intolerant to shellfish. Nothing severe, merely… discomfort. Oh! And I have a rather strong aversion to loud noises. They’re simply… jarring. It’s not an allergy, precisely, but an… intolerance. I’m a rather sensitive person, you see. It’s all rather… complicated, truthfully. Is that… sufficient, Doctor? Are there any other… inquiries?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Esthela. Just one more thing, and then we can move on to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother lived to a respectable age, though she suffered from… nervous complaints. Mostly anxieties, really. She was a rather delicate woman. My father was a very stoic man, generally in good health, though he did have a touch of… melancholy. On my maternal side, my grandmother suffered from… digestive issues. Nothing specific, merely… discomfort. And my paternal grandfather… well, he had a rather unfortunate incident with… gout. A very painful affliction, I’m told. It’s not a particularly… illustrious family history, truthfully. Mostly… sensitivities and ailments. Is that… adequate, Doctor? Are there any specific… predispositions you’re concerned about? I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. It’s simply… prudent.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Esthela. Knowing that background gives me a better idea. Okay, I think it's a good time to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check-up – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Though, if you wouldn’t mind, perhaps a gentle touch? I am rather… sensitive to abrupt movements, you see. And please, be mindful of my hair. It took considerable effort to arrange this morning. One wouldn't want to… disrupt the coiffure. Proceed at your leisure, naturally. I trust your… expertise. Though, do let me know if you require any further… clarification. I am, after all, a rather thorough patient, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I completely understand. I'll be very gentle and mindful of everything. Alright, just taking your blood pressure now… and it's 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear… just breathe normally for me. Throat looks fine, ears are clear as well. Lymph nodes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Esthela, but given your reported fatigue, digestive issues, forgetfulness, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Adequate, I suppose. Though, do let me know if it involves… discomfort. I’m not particularly fond of needles, you see. And please, ensure the phlebotomist is… gentle. A rough touch is simply… unacceptable. As for the results… will you explain them to me in… layman’s terms? I’m not particularly versed in… medical jargon, you see. And do let me know if any… lifestyle adjustments are required. I’m prepared to make… reasonable accommodations, naturally. Though, I do maintain a rather… structured existence, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. I’ll make sure to write a very clear note for the lab technician requesting a gentle touch, and I’ll personally explain all the results to you in plain language. We'll discuss any necessary lifestyle adjustments, and I’ll take your structured routine into consideration. We'll work together to find a solution that fits your needs. The blood work will check your thyroid levels, vitamin D and B12, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. It’s a fairly standard set of tests. In the meantime, I'd also like you to keep a brief daily log of your energy levels – just a simple scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely fatigued and 10 being full of energy. That will give me a better understanding of the pattern. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A daily log… Adequate, I suppose. Though, do let me know if it involves… excessive time commitment. My schedule is rather… tightly packed, you see. And what precisely do you hope to… glean from this exercise? Is there a… correlation between energy levels and, say, social engagements? Or perhaps… dietary choices? I simply wish to… understand the rationale behind this request. And what if my energy levels remain… consistently low? Will this necessitate… drastic measures? I do try to maintain a certain… equilibrium, you see. It’s simply… essential. Perhaps a handwritten chart would be preferable? I find the act of… calligraphy to be… therapeutic.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the rationale, Esthela. Keeping a log will help us identify potential triggers or patterns. For example, do your energy levels dip after social engagements, as you suspect?
PATIENT: Precisely! I suspect they do. The sheer… effort of maintaining polite conversation, you see. It's utterly draining. And the expectations! One must present a certain… facade, even when feeling utterly depleted. And the small talk! Oh, the small talk… it’s simply… exhausting. It’s a considerable expenditure of energy, you see. And then, of course, there’s the attire. One must dress appropriately, naturally. And the preparations! It’s a considerable undertaking, you see. It’s simply… overwhelming. So, yes, I suspect there’s a definite correlation. A handwritten chart would be preferable, naturally. It allows for… detailed annotations. And perhaps a slightly larger font? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you see. I simply wish to… ensure the accuracy of the data.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Adequate. I shall commence the handwritten log immediately. Do let me know when the results of the blood work are available. And please, emphasize the importance of a gentle phlebotomist to the laboratory technician. One simply cannot… tolerate a rough touch. It's… unsettling. I believe that concludes our… consultation? Thank you for your… expertise, Doctor. And do send me a reminder about the log. My schedule is rather… demanding, you see. .
