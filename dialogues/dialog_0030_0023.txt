DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it’s my chest. It… hurts a little. Like, not all the time, but it does hurt. It's been happening for maybe a week now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of chest pain. That's good information to start with. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to say it… It's not a sharp pain. More like… achy? And it's mostly on this side. Not like, really bad, but enough to notice. It doesn't go anywhere, just… stays there.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy pain localized to the left side of your chest, present for about a week. Does anything specifically cause the pain to start or worsen it?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I work on roofs, so it could be from that… lots of reaching and moving. But it doesn't feel like a muscle pain, you know? It's… different. Sometimes it feels a little worse when I lay down, but not always.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's not consistently related to activity, and you've noticed some correlation with lying down. And you feel it's distinct from typical muscle soreness. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel okay. Maybe a little tired, but I always work hard. No cough, no fever… nothing else. Oh! Sometimes my… nipples feel a little sore, too. But I didn't think that was important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or other symptoms, and occasional nipple soreness. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I haven't seen a doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to work through things. I'm pretty healthy, I think. My wife, she worries more than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. Just… a few bumps and bruises from falling off roofs sometimes. Nothing serious. It comes with the job, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mom, she had problems with her heart when she was old. But I don't know what kind of problems. She lived far away, so we didn't talk much. My dad, he was strong, never sick. I think my wife’s grandma had… something with her bones, maybe? I don’t remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems on your mother’s side and some bone issues potentially on your wife’s side. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything. Nothing. Just water, mostly. Sometimes my wife gives me vitamins, but I forget to take them. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or regular supplements. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, pretty much. No problems there. My wife always asks, but I always say no.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never liked it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with my wife sometimes, on a special occasion. And… no, no drugs. Never. I need to be strong for work!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some diminished breath sounds on the left side. Your pulse is 72 and blood pressure is 130/80. I’m noticing some tenderness when I press on your left chest. Is this where you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it. Right there. It doesn’t hurt bad, but I can feel it when you push. That’s the spot. It feels… kinda like a dull ache. Like it’s deep inside.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your extremities look normal, and you don’t appear to be in any acute distress. Based on what you've told me and the initial findings of the exam, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of your chest pain at this point. It could be musculoskeletal – related to your work – but the diminished breath sounds and the nipple soreness warrant further investigation. I would like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any lung or heart issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest… picture? Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong. If it helps find out, then yes. It doesn't sound too bad… is it expensive? I don't have… insurance.
DOCTOR: It’s a good question to ask about the cost. It will be approximately $250 without insurance. We also have a payment plan available if needed. The X-ray will allow us to get a better look at your lungs, heart, and chest wall. If anything concerning is found, we can discuss further testing like an EKG or a referral to a cardiologist. We will proceed step-by-step. Would you like me to proceed with the X-ray?
PATIENT: Two hundred and fifty… That’s… a lot of money. But… I guess I need to know. Yes, please. Do the picture. But… can we talk about the payment plan? My wife, she manages the money. It’s just… things have been tight lately.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can absolutely discuss a payment plan. Our billing department can work with you to create a schedule that fits your budget. I'll have them speak with your wife after the X-ray. Alright, let’s go ahead and get the X-ray done. The technician will explain the procedure to you, but it's quick and painless. Just stand still and breathe normally. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… breathe normal, you said? And they will tell me what to do? Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. And for the payment plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. That's what I’m here for. The technician is right this way. They'll get you taken care of quickly. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we'll discuss them together. Please let me know if you experience any worsening pain or shortness of breath while you wait.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor.
