DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the restroom quite a lot. More than usual, I think. It’s been… a while now, honestly. I don’t quite recall when it started, but it's become… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's alright, there's no need to be embarrassed. These things happen, and we'll figure it out together. “Quite a lot” is a bit vague, can you tell me roughly how many times a day you’re needing to go compared to, say, a typical day a few months ago?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. A typical day… months ago… Let me see. I suppose I used to go… three, perhaps four times a day? Now… now it feels like every couple of hours. Maybe six, seven times? It varies, you see. It's not a constant thing, but… considerably more than before, I assure you. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly. And I find myself drinking a lot more water to try and… well, to keep things moving, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, an increase from around three or four times a day to six or seven, and you've noticed you’re also drinking more fluids. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Not at all. Just… the frequency. And the volume… it’s not a large amount each time, but… often. I haven't noticed any… other changes, I don't believe. It's just this constant need to visit the facilities. I do sometimes wake up once during the night to go, which I don’t recall ever doing before. It’s all a bit… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning, increased frequency – six to seven times a day, increased fluid intake, and waking up at night to urinate. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. That's a tricky one. I suppose it looks normal. Pale yellow, as usual. I haven’t really… paid close attention, to be honest. And smell… no, I don't think so. Nothing different that I've noticed. I’m really not one for… scrutinizing my urine, Doctor. Forgive me. I just know I’m going far too often. I'm starting to feel quite foolish explaining all this. Is it something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: No, please don't feel foolish at all. It's important to discuss these things. And I assure you, many things can cause increased urination, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious. Let's get a little more information. Do you have any history of diabetes, or has it run in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. My mother… she had some health problems, but I don't recall diabetes specifically. And my father… he was quite healthy, actually. I’ve never been tested for it, myself. I suppose I should have been more diligent about these things, but… one tends to put these matters off, doesn’t one? I’ve always been reasonably fit, kept active, ate… well, reasonably well. I am not entirely sure about family history, honestly. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known history of diabetes, unsure about family history. And you said you've been reasonably active and eat a reasonably healthy diet. Do you have any difficulty starting or stopping your urine stream, or do you feel like you’re not emptying your bladder completely when you go?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty starting or stopping. It flows normally, as it always has. And I feel… adequately emptied, I suppose. It doesn’t feel like there’s anything left behind. It’s just the frequency, Doctor. It’s really the main concern. I’ve been trying to limit my fluids before bedtime, but… it still happens. I’m a bit worried it might be something… serious, and I’m hoping it’s nothing too debilitating. I do enjoy my gardening, you see, and constantly having to run indoors is… inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright, no difficulty with stream, feels fully emptied, limiting fluids at night, but still waking to urinate. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to do a simple urine test to check for infection or sugar. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. The urine test sounds sensible, and a quick examination… well, it can’t hurt, I suppose. Please proceed at your convenience. I just hope it’s nothing too troublesome. Perhaps it’s just a phase, a minor imbalance… one can always hope.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie down on the examination table, we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. It will be quick and painless. Then we'll get a urine sample. Do you have any issues with mobility that I should be aware of when you lie down?
PATIENT: No, no issues with mobility at all, Doctor. Perfectly capable, thank you. I can lie down with no trouble whatsoever. I used to be quite the swimmer, you see, so flexibility isn’t a problem. Please proceed whenever you’re ready. I am a bit chilly, though… is it alright if I keep my jacket on? It’s a bit drafty in here, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Certainly, please keep your jacket on if you’re chilly. We want you to be comfortable. Alright, everything sounds clear and normal with your heart and lungs. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Now, if you could just collect a urine sample for me when you are able, we’ll send that to the lab. There's a cup in the bathroom, and instructions on the counter. I'll be right outside when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Sounds reassuring so far. I will collect the sample right away. The bathroom is this way, I presume? And thank you again for your thoroughness. It's a relief to know everything sounds… normal, at least initially. I’ll be back shortly with the specimen.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall to your right. Take your time. I'll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. As quickly as I could manage. I hope I followed the instructions correctly. It's a bit awkward, but one does what one must.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. You followed the instructions perfectly, don't worry about it. Alright, I'm going to send this off to the lab now. It should take about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. While we wait, is there anything else you’ve noticed, any changes in your diet or medications recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes to my diet or medications, Doctor. I’ve been taking the same blood pressure pills for years, and my diet has been rather consistent. I do enjoy a good pastry now and then, but nothing excessive. And I haven't started any new supplements or anything of that nature. I suppose I've been a little more stressed lately… my garden hasn’t been doing particularly well, and that’s been occupying my thoughts. But I wouldn’t say it's anything major. It's just… frustrating, a hobby not flourishing as expected.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes to medication or diet, a little more stress due to your garden. That's helpful to know. Stress can sometimes exacerbate urinary frequency. We'll see what the lab results show. The results are back. Your urine analysis shows no signs of infection and your glucose levels are normal. Everything looks within the normal range. This is good news; it rules out a few common causes. Given your normal lab results and the fact that you don't have any other concerning symptoms, it's likely this is a case of overactive bladder, possibly related to increased fluid intake and stress.
PATIENT: Overactive bladder… and stress, you say? Well, that’s… somewhat relieving, in a way. Not something serious, then? Just an annoyance? I suppose I’ve always been prone to worrying, and the garden… it’s my sanctuary, really. To have it not thrive… it does get to me. So, what does one do about an overactive bladder? Is there anything I can do to manage it? Medications, perhaps? Or exercises? I am willing to try whatever it takes to regain some semblance of control.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not something serious, and it’s very manageable. We can absolutely try some things. There are several options. First, we can try behavioral therapies. This includes things like bladder training – gradually increasing the time between trips to the bathroom – and timed voiding. We can also look at fluid management – ensuring you’re drinking enough water, but limiting fluids before bedtime. Medications are an option as well, but I typically like to start with behavioral modifications first. There are also pelvic floor exercises, often called Kegel exercises, which can strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. Would you be interested in a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor therapy?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor therapy… hmm. I suppose that sounds sensible. If it helps strengthen those muscles… yes, a referral would be excellent, thank you. I am willing to try anything that might alleviate this… inconvenience. Behavioral modifications, timed voiding… I can certainly attempt those. Perhaps a schedule will help. And I’ll be mindful of my fluid intake before bed. It’s just… frustrating, to have to plan around it all. But if that’s what it takes… Yes, please, the referral to a physical therapist. And perhaps a pamphlet or some written instructions on these behavioral therapies? Just to have something to refer to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve arranged a referral to Sarah Miller, a very good physical therapist specializing in pelvic floor therapy. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here’s a pamphlet with detailed instructions on bladder training and timed voiding. It also has tips on managing fluid intake. "To summarize, we’ve ruled out any serious underlying conditions. It's likely overactive bladder, possibly exacerbated by stress and increased fluid intake. We're starting with behavioral therapies and a referral to physical therapy. If those aren’t effective, we can discuss medication options further." Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so, Doctor. That all sounds very thorough and… reassuring, actually. Thank you for taking the time to listen, investigate, and provide a plan. It’s a relief to know it’s not something… dire. I shall attempt the behavioral therapies and see what Sarah Miller recommends. Perhaps a little more focus on my inner peace is also in order… less worrying about the garden, perhaps? Thank you again for your kindness and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. Remember, reducing stress can certainly help. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Have a good day, and I hope your garden starts thriving again soon! .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
