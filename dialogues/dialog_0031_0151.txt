DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it's this… tingling. It’s in my hands and feet mostly. Been happening on and off for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I'd like to get it checked out if that’s alright. I don't want to waste your time, though.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Uzarski, that’s precisely what we’re here for. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “On and off” is helpful information. Could you describe the tingling a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it’s not painful, exactly. More like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just in my fingers, other times it’s my toes, and sometimes it’s both. It’s hard to explain, really. It doesn’t happen all the time, just… randomly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. “Pins and needles” and intermittent, that gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned it happens randomly – can you think of anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I haven't noticed anything specific. I mean, sometimes it feels a little worse when I've been on my feet all day – you know, with the mail route. But even when I’m resting, it can happen. It just… comes and goes. I wish I knew what was causing it. I've been trying to think, but my mind isn't what it used to be. Is that okay? I’m not much help, I bet.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Uzarski. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a specific trigger, these things aren't always obvious. Being a mail carrier, spending a lot of time on your feet, is good information. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet, alongside the tingling?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can still grip things and walk just fine. Nothing feels weaker, exactly. I’ve dropped a few things lately, but I just figured I was being clumsy! Old age, you know? But no, I haven’t noticed any real weakness. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. And thank you for clarifying. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin color, or any rashes or sores on your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, no rashes or anything like that. My skin looks pretty normal, I think. I look in the mirror sometimes, but… well, I’m not as good at noticing things as I used to be. Everything feels a little… numb sometimes, if that makes sense. But no visible changes, no. Is something wrong? You’re making me a little nervous now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Uzarski, and I apologize if I'm causing you any anxiety. We’re just gathering information at this point. “Numbness” is a useful addition. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me if the tingling or numbness travels anywhere else – up your arms, or legs perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. It mostly stays in my hands and feet. Sometimes it feels a little bit up my wrists, maybe, but not very far. Never up my arms or legs. It’s pretty localized, I think. I’m a bit worried now, though. Is this something serious? I really just want to know what’s causing it and how to make it stop. I have a lot of mail to deliver, you know!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Uzarski. We’ll work to get to the bottom of this. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet. Other than that, nothing major. My husband… well, he had some things, but he’s passed now. I don’t think I inherited anything from him. I really haven’t been to the doctor much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Uzarski. And I’m sorry for your loss. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for my arthritis, but that’s it. And not very often. I really try to tough things out, you know? Is this taking long? I have a route to finish. I don't want to keep you from other patients.
DOCTOR: You are not keeping me from other patients, Ms. Uzarski. We’ll take as much time as we need. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam if that's alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. That sounds… alright, I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a lot of mail waiting for me. Just… please be gentle, okay? My hands aren’t what they used to be. Let's get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski, just relax your arm for me. I'm going to check your reflexes now… good. And now your other arm… Okay. Now, I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it. Alright… Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which isn’t uncommon with age. Strength appears normal in both hands and feet. However, sensation is slightly decreased in your fingertips and toes – it’s subtle, but noticeable. And I notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you experience any pain in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn’t sound good, does it? No, I don’t usually have pain in my ankles. Sometimes they feel a little achy after a long day on my feet, but nothing really painful. Swelling, you say? I hadn’t noticed. I wear pretty thick socks, you know. What does that mean? Is it serious? Is it something I did?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't had pain, Ms. Uzarski. And no, it doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong. Diminished reflexes and some decreased sensation can be a normal part of aging, but the swelling in your ankles, along with the tingling and decreased sensation, warrants further investigation. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like we should consider a few possibilities. One potential cause could be peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage. This can be caused by various things, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or even certain medications. Another possibility is a circulation problem. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, and kidney function. I also recommend an ankle-brachial index test, which measures the blood flow in your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Nerve damage and circulation problems? That sounds… scary. Blood tests and more tests? Alright, alright, if you think it’s necessary. But… will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. And I really just want to get back to work. Can we at least rule out anything serious before we do a lot of tests? I’m starting to feel really worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Uzarski, and I want to assure you we'll proceed cautiously. It’s good you brought up the cost – I’m aware you don’t have insurance, and we can discuss options to help minimize the expense. We have a financial counselor who can explore assistance programs and payment plans. We'll also prioritize the most essential tests first. To start, I recommend the blood tests. They’re relatively inexpensive and can help us rule out some of the more common causes of neuropathy, like diabetes and vitamin deficiencies. The ABI test is also fairly straightforward and can provide valuable information about your circulation. I don't believe there's an immediate emergency, but it’s important to get this investigated to prevent any potential complications down the line. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with medications before. Latex is fine too, I think. Alright. Blood tests then. Let’s just get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I really need to get back to my route, you know. The mail won’t deliver itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is very skilled and gentle. It will only take about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw, and then the results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend wearing comfortable shoes and socks, and try to avoid standing for prolonged periods. If the tingling becomes more severe or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness or pain, please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, print out a lab requisition form for you, and she’ll explain the process in detail. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Comfortable shoes… I always wear comfortable shoes. Thank you… I think. I really hope it’s nothing serious. Alright then. I’ll go find Maria. Thank you for seeing me.
