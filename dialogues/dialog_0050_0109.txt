DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mitchell. It's nice to meet you too. Well... my head. Back of my head hurts. Been hurting for... maybe three days now? Not all the time, comes and goes. Feels like… a heavy weight, maybe? Not a bad pain, just… there. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a heavy weight, you say. I understand. And it’s been present for approximately three days, coming and going. Let's try to pinpoint this a bit more accurately. Could you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Precise... that's hard. I'm not good with… fancy words. It's not a sharp pain, not like when I hit my thumb with the hammer. More like… a dull ache. And it spreads. Sometimes just the back, sometimes it goes to the sides of my head a little. It's worse when I'm tired, I think. Or when I bend over. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you, Mitchell. A dull ache radiating from the back of the head, worsening with fatigue or bending over. We will need to rule out a number of possibilities. To start, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... let me think. No fever, I don't think. No dizziness. I haven't thrown up. My eyes… they feel okay. Sometimes a little blurry, but I always need glasses, so that’s nothing new. Maybe… a little tired, but I am ninety years old, Doctor. Is that what you mean? Like, something besides just being old?
DOCTOR: Precisely. I appreciate you clarifying that. No fever, no vomiting, vision is stable with your usual blurriness. Let's delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… well, my knees bother me something awful when it rains. The doctor at home, he says it's just old age. I had a little trouble with my heart, years ago, but they fixed it. Had a… a pace-maker put in. It's been good for a long time now, though. I don't see that doctor anymore. Moved here, you know? Just trying to get settled. Anything else? I'm trying to remember… I forget things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mitchell. Knee pain exacerbated by weather and a history of cardiac issues with pacemaker implantation. That is very helpful. And it’s perfectly understandable to have some memory lapses. Have you had any surgeries besides the pacemaker implantation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I broke my wrist when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. They set it, but I don't think they did surgery. And… my appendix, a long time ago. That was surgery. And… I had my tonsils out when I was young. That's about it, I think. A lot of years go by, you know? Makes it hard to remember everything. Is that important, Doctor? The tonsils?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a complete picture, Mitchell, so yes, the tonsillectomy is noted. Now, regarding your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she had… well, she died of something with her heart, I think. A long time ago. My father, he lived a long life, mostly healthy. He had trouble breathing when he got old. And… my sister, she had the sugar sickness. Diabetes, they called it. She had to watch what she ate. That’s all I can really remember, Doctor. It was a long time ago and we didn’t talk much about… health things. Not like now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. History of cardiac issues in your mother, respiratory problems in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Now, may I ask about your current medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Medications. Let me think... The heart doctor, before I moved, he gave me a little white pill. For my heart. I take one every morning. And... that's it, I think. Nothing for my knees, and nothing else. I mostly just try to take it easy. I don’t like taking too many pills. Makes me feel… funny. Do you need to know what the little white pill is? I don’t remember the name. I just ask the pharmacy to give me more when I run out.
DOCTOR: Yes, knowing the name of that medication would be quite helpful, Mitchell. Do you happen to have a list of your medications, perhaps from a previous doctor or the pharmacy?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I don’t really keep things like that. I just… go to the pharmacy and tell them what I need. They know me, you know? They always give me the right pills. Maybe… maybe they can tell you what I take? If you call them? I don't know the name, and I don’t have a list. I’m sorry. I’m not very good with this… remembering things.
DOCTOR: That is… acceptable, Mitchell. We can certainly contact your pharmacy to obtain that information. In the meantime, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones aren't what they used to be. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mitchell. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 148 over 86, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds… a bit muffled, but no immediate concerns. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I’m just going to gently feel along the back of your head and neck. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: It's… a little tender, yes. Right there. Not a sharp pain, but… sensitive. Like when you bruise your arm, you know? Just a dull ache when you press on it. I haven’t been hitting my head, Doctor, if that’s what you’re thinking! I'm just an old man.
DOCTOR: No, I wasn’t implying anything of the sort, Mitchell. Just assessing for tenderness. There is mild tenderness to palpation at the base of the skull, as you noted. Given your history and these findings, I believe we should order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any underlying structural issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a scan? Like at the airport? I don't like those machines. Are you sure it's necessary, Doctor? I just have a headache. Maybe it's just old age, like the other doctor said. And… will it cost a lot of money? I don't have much money, you see. I’m a bit worried about that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mitchell. A CT scan is not like the one at the airport. It provides a much more detailed image and requires a brief exposure to radiation. However, given the persistent headache, the tenderness, and your age, it is prudent to investigate further to rule out anything serious. We can discuss options for minimizing cost, and I can help connect you with resources that may assist with financial concerns. The scan will help us determine the cause of your headache and ensure we are providing the best possible care. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. Slowly. I want to know what it involves, and… what could be wrong. I'm not afraid, exactly, but I like to know what's happening. And… will it hurt? I'm always worried about hurting. And about the money, too. Just… be honest with me, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mitchell. I will be as thorough and honest as possible. The CT scan – Computed Tomography scan – uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your head. It's a relatively quick procedure, typically taking only a few minutes. You will lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It is important to remain very still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. Regarding discomfort, the scan itself is painless. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation. We may need to inject a contrast dye into a vein to improve the clarity of the images, which can cause a brief flushing sensation. Now, what could be wrong?
PATIENT: Go on. What could be wrong? Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. I can handle it. Just tell me. Is it something bad? Like… a tumor? Or something with my brain? I’ve heard stories… I don’t want to scare you, but… tell me the truth. And how much will this scan cost? I need to know if I can afford it.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, it’s good you are asking these questions. There are several possibilities, and it’s important to remember that the scan is to rule these out. It could be a muscle tension headache, which is the most common cause. It could also be related to some mild inflammation, or, less commonly, something more serious. A tumor is a possibility, but it is relatively uncommon. We also need to consider the possibility of a small bleed, or a structural abnormality. Regarding cost, a CT scan without contrast typically ranges from $300 to $600. With contrast, it can be closer to $700 to $1000. However, this can vary significantly depending on the facility and your insurance status. As you mentioned you are not insured, we will need to explore options for financial assistance. I can connect you with our patient financial services department, who can help you determine if you qualify for any programs. We can also discuss the possibility of a payment plan. It’s important to stress again that the scan is to give us a clear picture of what's happening, so we can provide you with the appropriate care. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it allows us to investigate thoroughly. Before we proceed, do you have any immediate concerns or questions about the procedure itself, or the potential risks involved?
PATIENT: That's… a lot to take in. Seven hundred dollars… that's… a lot of money. I don’t know if I can afford that. But… I don't want anything bad to be growing in my head, either. Risks… hmm. What are the risks of the scan itself? Could it… hurt my brain? Could it make me sick? I've heard stories about radiation, too. And… what if they find something bad? What happens then? I’m getting scared now, Doctor. Really scared. Maybe… maybe I should just try to live with the headache. It comes and goes, you know? Maybe it is just old age.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, it’s perfectly understandable that you are scared. It’s a natural reaction to facing uncertainty. Let me address your concerns directly. The risks of the CT scan are minimal. The primary risk is exposure to a small amount of radiation. However, the radiation dose is very low, and the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this situation. The risk of causing any harm to your brain is extremely low. Some people may experience mild nausea or a warm sensation during the scan, but these side effects are usually temporary. Now, what if we find something?
PATIENT: What if… what if you find a tumor, Doctor? What happens then? Do I… do I have to have surgery? Will I… will I die? I’m an old man. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t want to spend my last days in a hospital. I just want to be comfortable. Tell me the truth, Doctor. Is it a bad thing if you find something? Is it… is it hopeless? I need to know. Even if it’s bad news. Just… be honest with me. Please.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, that is a very important question, and I will answer it as honestly as I can. If we do find a tumor, it does not automatically mean it is hopeless. There are many different types of tumors, and some are benign—meaning they are not cancerous and do not spread. Others are cancerous, but even those can often be treated successfully, depending on their size, location, and type. Treatment options vary greatly. They can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these. In some cases, we may simply monitor the tumor without intervention, especially if it is small and not causing any symptoms. Your age is a factor, but it does not mean you are not a candidate for treatment. We would carefully consider your overall health and your wishes before making any decisions. If treatment is not possible or desired, we would focus on managing your symptoms and ensuring your comfort. I understand your fear, Mitchell. Facing the unknown is daunting. But I want you to know that you would not be alone. We have a team of specialists who can provide you with the best possible care and support. Let’s take this one step at a time. We will start with the CT scan. Once we have the results, we can discuss them thoroughly and make a plan together. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. I… I guess that’s all I can do. The scan… when can we do it? And… will I have to drink anything special before? I always get nervous before these things. And… can my daughter come with me? She lives nearby. I want her there. Just… just to hold my hand. And… about the cost… please, promise me you’ll help me find a way to pay for it. I don’t want to be a burden. Just… take care of me, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mitchell. I promise to do everything I can to take care of you. We can schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. It's best to have an empty stomach, so please refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight. You do not need to drink anything special beforehand. And yes, absolutely, your daughter is more than welcome to come with you. Having someone there for support is a wonderful idea. Regarding the cost, I will personally connect you with our patient financial services department right after this consultation. They are experts at helping patients navigate their options and find assistance programs. We will explore all possibilities and work together to find a solution. I will also advocate for you and ensure you receive the best possible care, regardless of your financial situation. You are not a burden, Mitchell. You deserve the best possible care, and I am here to provide it. Now, let’s get this scheduled and take it one step at a time. Before we finish, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve answered everything. Thank you. Thank you for being so patient with me. And… for being honest. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little better now. Knowing that you’re here… that you’ll help me… that makes a difference. Just… don’t let me fall. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know? Tomorrow at nine, you said? I’ll try to remember. And I’ll ask my daughter to come with me. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a good man. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mitchell. And I promise, I will do everything I can to ensure your safety and comfort. I will personally escort you to the radiology department tomorrow morning and remain with you until you are settled. Yes, tomorrow at nine. And it was a pleasure meeting you as well. Now, I will have my assistant schedule the scan and connect you with our financial services department. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we will take this one step at a time.
