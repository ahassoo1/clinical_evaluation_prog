DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s like this… I just wanted to ask a favor, really. My niece, she’s been… not feeling very supportive, you understand? I thought maybe a nice card from a real doctor, with some words of… encouragement, would help cheer me up. Something official, you know? Medicare covers these things, right? For… spirits?
DOCTOR: I… see. Mr. Kammer, this clinic provides medical care. We address physical health concerns. A card for emotional support… isn't quite within the scope of my practice, nor typically a covered Medicare service. Are you experiencing any specific physical symptoms that are troubling you?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Well, no, not exactly. I feel… low. Like the wind took all the starch out of my collar, you know? But that’s not… a thing you fix with a pill, is it? I just figured a doctor's card… it carries weight. More weight than something my niece scribbles, anyway. She doesn’t understand… things. Is there nothing you can do? Just a little note?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're feeling down, but a physician’s note isn't appropriate for… general encouragement. Perhaps a visit with a therapist or counselor would be more helpful?
PATIENT: A… a therapist? Doctor, with all due respect, I’m a man who keeps things to himself. Been that way my whole life. I fix boilers, not feelings. I just thought… you’re a doctor. You write things. It couldn't be that hard. Are you telling me you won’t even consider it? A simple “Get Well Soon” or something? I don't understand… it's a small favor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I appreciate you coming in, but I must reiterate: writing a card for emotional support falls outside the ethical boundaries of medical practice. To do so would be… inappropriate. It diminishes the importance of legitimate medical documentation and could even be considered unethical. Perhaps you could discuss these feelings with a trusted friend or family member?
PATIENT: Ethical boundaries… Always something with these new rules. Look, I didn’t come here asking for a diagnosis, alright? I just… I just wanted a little help. My niece thinks I’m being silly. Maybe you could just… write something general? Like, “Hope things get better”? It’s not hurting anyone. Are you absolutely refusing? Even that little bit?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're frustrated. However, even a general note of encouragement, presented as coming from a medical professional in this context, would be inappropriate. It creates a false impression of medical treatment. I am concerned about the appropriateness of this request, and I must decline. Have you considered reaching out to a community support group?
PATIENT: A… a support group? Doctor, I’m a grown man. I don’t need to sit around holding hands with strangers. I just wanted a simple card. I came to a doctor. It's… ridiculous. Fine. Forget it. I wasted my time. Thank you for nothing.
