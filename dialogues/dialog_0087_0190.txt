DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling rather unsteady. Like… off balance, I suppose. It’s been… worrying me. I don’t quite recall when it started, truthfully. It feels like it’s been some time, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling unsteady and off balance is certainly concerning. You said you don’t recall exactly when it started, but can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: A rough estimate… hmm. It's difficult. Perhaps… a few months? Or was it longer? I really wish I could be more precise. My husband… he always remembered everything. It feels like it was before… before he passed, certainly. But beyond that… it’s all a bit hazy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Snerling. Grief can certainly affect one's memory. A few months is a helpful starting point. And I’m very sorry for your loss. Now, focusing on the unsteadiness… can you describe how you feel unsteady?
PATIENT: How… how do I feel? It’s not a constant thing, you see. Sometimes I’m perfectly fine, walking normally. Other times… it’s like the room is tilting, or I’m tilting. Not dizzy, exactly. More like… floating? And I stumble sometimes. Not often, but enough to make me nervous. It feels… precarious, if that makes sense. I worry about falling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Precarious” is a good way to describe it. And it’s good you’re recognizing the worry about falling. You mentioned it’s not constant. Are there any specific things that seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Triggers… let me see. I work on a rig, you know? Rotary drill operator. It’s quite physical. I think… being up high makes it worse, naturally. But even on solid ground… sometimes it just happens. I haven’t noticed a pattern, not really. Though… I do find it’s worse when I’m tired. Long shifts, not enough sleep… definitely doesn’t help. And… loud noises, perhaps? It’s a noisy environment at work, so it’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potential triggers include being at height, fatigue, and possibly loud noises. That’s helpful. And working as a rotary drill operator is physically demanding. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been… a little more forgetful than usual, perhaps? Though, as I mentioned before, my memory hasn't been the best lately. No… I don’t think so. No headaches, no blurred vision, no ringing in my ears. Nothing like that. Just… the unsteadiness, and a general feeling of… being off. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily the unsteadiness and a general feeling of being “off.” The forgetfulness could be related to stress and grief, as you mentioned. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: I… believe so. I had a bout of… bronchitis, a few years back. Nothing serious, thankfully. And I fractured my wrist once, when I was a child. But nothing… chronic, if that’s the word? My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments. I mostly just… followed his lead. I have insurance, private insurance, if that helps. I’m afraid I don’t have much information to offer beyond that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Snerling. Knowing about the bronchitis and the fractured wrist is helpful. And yes, private insurance is good to know. I’m going to access your electronic health record now to see if there’s any more information available. …Okay, I see here you were treated for a mild concussion about five years ago, after a fall at work. Is that correct?
PATIENT: A concussion… yes, that’s right! I… I had completely forgotten. It was… a bit of a tumble, near the drill. I was mostly shaken up, I think. I took some time off, and then… went back to work. I don’t recall any long-term effects, but… perhaps that’s relevant? It’s good you found that. My memory really is… unreliable these days.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Snerling. A history of concussion is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven’t needed anything, thankfully. Just… occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains after a long shift. But nothing regular. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, if that makes sense. I always try to rest and… push through it, if possible. Though, perhaps that’s not the best approach.
DOCTOR: No, that's understandable. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always asked me when I ate something new, just to be safe. But I don’t recall any allergies. I’m fairly certain, but… I suppose it’s always possible. Is there something specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: No, just making sure. Okay, and finally, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was young, from… a heart condition, I believe. My father… he was fairly healthy, as far as I know. But he wasn’t one for doctors, either. We didn’t talk much about medical things. I’m afraid I don’t have much information to offer there, either. I apologize. It feels like I’m being… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You are not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Snerling. I understand that these things can be difficult to recall, especially with recent loss. Okay, let's move on to a brief physical examination. I'm going to check your vital signs, and then do a neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I would like to get to the bottom of this, if possible. I want to be able to continue working, but… not if it’s unsafe. So, please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here on the table, we'll get started. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6. All within normal limits. Now, I'm going to check your ears, eyes, and throat. Everything looks clear here. Now, let's move on to the neurological exam. I'm going to have you follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll check your reflexes. Okay, your eye movements are normal. Your reflexes are a bit diminished in your lower extremities, but not significantly. Now, let's check your balance. I’m going to have you stand with your feet together and close your eyes. …Hmm. You’re a little unsteady even with your eyes open, and significantly more unsteady with your eyes closed. I also noticed a slight sway when you walk.
PATIENT: Unsteady… yes, that’s what I’ve been feeling. It’s… disconcerting to hear you say it, but… it’s a relief to know it’s not just me. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Is it the concussion, perhaps? Or… something else? I’m… a little worried now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Snerling, it's good that we're able to objectively document your unsteadiness. Based on the neurological exam and your history of concussion, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to the concussion, a post-concussive syndrome, even years later. However, the diminished reflexes and sway suggest we should also rule out other potential causes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some further testing. Specifically, I recommend a complete blood count, a vitamin D level, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds… thorough. Complete blood count and vitamin D… alright. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I… I want to understand what’s happening, and I want to be able to feel safe again. An MRI sounds… a little frightening, but if it’s necessary, then yes, let’s do it. What… what does it involve? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. An MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's non-invasive, meaning it doesn't involve any injections or surgery. You'll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it's important to remain very still during the scan. It can be a bit noisy, and some people feel claustrophobic, but we can provide headphones and ensure you're comfortable. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, it typically takes a few days for the radiologist to interpret the images and send a report to me. Once I have the report, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate your unsteadiness, and please, don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions about the MRI or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers it. It sounds… a bit daunting, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. A bit daunting, but necessary, I suppose. And… thank you. Thank you for listening, and for taking this seriously. It’s… a relief to finally be getting some answers, or at least… trying to. So, what do I need to do to schedule the MRI? And… will my insurance cover it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Snerling. I understand your apprehension, and we'll do everything we can to make the experience as comfortable as possible. My nurse, Sarah, will schedule the MRI for you before you leave today. She’ll also verify your insurance coverage and let you know if there are any out-of-pocket costs. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for meclizine, an antihistamine, which can help with the feeling of unsteadiness. It’s not a cure, but it may provide some symptomatic relief. I'll also give you a work note excusing you from tasks that require height or strenuous activity until we have the results of the MRI. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very helpful, Doctor. Meclizine… and the work note. Thank you. That’s… a weight off my shoulders, honestly. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your kindness. I… I feel much better knowing there’s a plan in place. I suppose I’ll just wait for Sarah, then? And… try to rest in the meantime? .
DOCTOR: Exactly. Sarah will be with you shortly. And yes, rest is good. Avoid any activities that make your symptoms worse.
