DOCTOR: Alright, Betty, good to see you. Or... good to meet you. It's a busy day, so if we could just jump right in, that'd be great. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello there, Doctor... Gorga, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s me ears, you see. They just aren’t what they used to be. Everything’s a bit… muffled. Hard to hear folks talkin’, especially if there’s any noise around. Not sure when it started, really. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Muffled, gradually… okay. Eighty-three, right?
PATIENT: That’s right, eighty-three. Though some days it feels older, ha! Used to work in the shoe factory, you know. Lots of noise in there, clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. Maybe that had somethin’ to do with it? I don't rightly remember… it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Shoe factory… right, loud environment. That could be a factor, definitely. Okay. And is it… both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, um… both, I think. Hard to say for sure. They both feel… quiet. Not completely gone, mind you. I can still hear things, just… not as clear. Sometimes I have to ask folks to repeat themselves, and then I feel bad, you know? A silly old woman askin' what was said…
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Betty. It's very common, especially with your history. Let's do a quick check of your ears, if you don't mind. Just gonna take a look inside, see what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… don’t poke too hard, ha! They're a bit sensitive, you see. I don't like things goin' in me ears. Not a fan of that at all.
DOCTOR: No poking, I promise. Just a quick peek. Lean forward a little for me, please. Alright... hmm. Some wax buildup in both ears, looks like. And the ear canals are a little… narrowed. Nothing major, but it could be contributing to the muffling. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. It's standard practice. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? Well, I suppose I should have been cleanin’ ‘em better. Never really thought much about it. Listen to me heart, you say? Alright, go ahead. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to startle me with that cold thing, ha! I jump easy these days.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, a little bit of diminished breath sounds, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few quick questions. Just simple stuff, okay?
PATIENT: Alright, questions are fine. Just… don’t make ‘em too tricky now, ha! My memory ain’t what it used to be, you know. I forget things awful easy. Ask away, Doctor. I’ll do me best.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Simple stuff. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Um… now that you mention it… sometimes. A faint sort of… buzzin’. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. It’s quiet, though. Hardly noticeable, usually. Is that… bad? I don’t know if I’ve ever told anyone about that. Seems silly, ha!
DOCTOR: No, it's not silly at all. Ringing, or tinnitus, is common. And it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. Okay. And have you had any dizziness or trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Dizziness… well, I do get a little unsteady on me feet sometimes. But I just figured that was from gettin’ old! I trip over things now and then, you know. Nothing too bad, just a little wobble. Haven’t actually fallen or anything. Just a bit clumsy these days, I suppose. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little unsteadiness. Good to know. Now, one last quick thing. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor gave me somethin' for me arthritis a while back. A little white pill. I take it every day, I think. And… sometimes I take somethin' for me blood pressure, but I forget to take it regular. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to, but… well, you know how it is. Old age and a bad memory! I can’t recall the names of ‘em right now, sorry.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Arthritis medication and blood pressure medication, intermittently. It's alright, don't worry about the names. Look, Betty, based on what you've told me, and the quick exam I did, it sounds like you likely have age-related hearing loss, possibly with some wax buildup contributing to the problem. The tinnitus and occasional unsteadiness are common with hearing loss too. Now, the good news is, we can do something about this. I recommend we start by removing the wax. It's a simple procedure. And we can discuss hearing aids if the hearing loss is significant enough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, wax, huh? Well, that sounds sensible. Get the wax out, that’s a good start. Hearing aids… now, I don’t know about that. Seems a bit… fancy. I’ve never had nothin’ like that before. Are they expensive? And will I be able to hear properly? I don’t want to be botherin’ folks askin’ ‘em to repeat themselves all the time, ha! It’s alright if we just try gettin’ the wax out first, you know. Don't wanna rush into nothin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no rush at all. We'll start with the wax removal, that's the sensible thing to do. It's a quick procedure, usually doesn't take long. And then we can re-evaluate your hearing and see if hearing aids are needed. They are an investment, yes, but there are different levels and options. We can talk about that if it comes to it. I’m going to get the nurse to schedule you for a wax removal appointment. In the meantime, try to avoid getting water in your ears. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright, wax removal it is. No water in me ears, got it. Nurse, you say? That’s fine. Just… tell ‘em to be gentle, ha! I don’t like folks pokin’ around in there too much. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me and me bad memory. It’s nice to have someone listenin’, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. It’s my job. And I'll make a note for the nurse to be gentle. She's very good. I'll have her come in and get you scheduled. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just the wax removal. And maybe… maybe just a little reassurance that I won’t go completely deaf, ha! I worry about things sometimes, you know. Old age and all. Thank you again. You’ve been a real help.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think you'll go completely deaf, Betty. We're taking good care of you. It's good to be proactive. The nurse will be right in. You have a good day now.
