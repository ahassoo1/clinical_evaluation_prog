DOCTOR: Right. Darl Nini, 79 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it's a bit silly, really. My… my daughter, bless her heart, she says I should know my blood type. Something about… emergencies, I think? I don't quite recall why it's so important, but she was very insistent. I just want to know, you see? If you can tell me.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mrs. Nini. Knowing your blood type can be useful, though frankly, at your age, it’s… not the most pressing concern. Still, we can certainly find out. It's a simple blood test. Before we order that, though, are you generally healthy?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Generally… yes, I suppose. I have my aches and pains, you know, the usual for someone my age. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And I get a bit tired easily. But no… no serious illnesses, not that I remember. I used to be very strong, you know. A rigger, I was. Lots of lifting and climbing. But that was a long time ago. I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: A rigger?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. On the ships, mostly. Back when things were… different. Lots of ropes and pulleys and… well, it was hard work. Not for the faint of heart. We secured the cargo, made sure everything was safe for travel. I was quite good at it, if I do say so myself. Though my hands aren't as steady as they used to be for knot-tying. It’s been… oh, many years since I did that sort of work. My husband, God rest his soul, he was a sailor. That’s how I got started.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no major illnesses diagnosed, as far as you recall. And you're currently experiencing some fatigue and knee pain. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees?
PATIENT: Hmm… swelling, you say? Sometimes, yes. After I’ve been on my feet for a bit. Not a lot, just… a bit puffy. And redness… not usually, no. It's more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. I mostly just try to rest them when they bother me. I don’t recall falling or anything to cause it, if that's what you’re wondering. Just… old age, I expect.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh dear, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Sometimes I feel a bit… breathless, when I climb the stairs. But that could just be… being out of shape, I suppose. And I get a little dizzy sometimes, if I stand up too quickly. But those things happen, don't they? I don't think there's anything… serious. I just want to know my blood type, if you don't mind. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Nini, it’s not too much to ask. But before we proceed with a blood test solely for blood type, I’d like to rule out anything more concerning given your reports of fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. It’s just… prudent medical practice. Have you had any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Oh… no, not exactly. Sometimes a little… a little tightness, perhaps. But I always thought it was just indigestion. I do enjoy my food, you see. And I worry a bit, sometimes. It comes and goes so quickly, it’s hard to say. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Is that what you mean by chest pain? It's probably nothing, really. Just my nerves.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing" is not a diagnosis, Mrs. Nini. Given your age and these symptoms—fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and now this tightness in your chest—I'm going to order an EKG and some blood work. We need to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any cardiac issues. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… rather a lot of tests. I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. As for medications… let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you see? Nothing fancy. I think that’s all. Unless… oh, sometimes a little something for my nerves, but my daughter brings that over when she visits. I don’t remember the name.
DOCTOR: “A little something for your nerves”?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. She says it helps me relax. It’s… a small blue pill, I think? She gets it for me at the pharmacy. I don’t really pay attention to the names of things, you see. I just take it when she tells me to. It makes me feel a little… calmer. But I don’t take it every day, just when I’m feeling particularly anxious. It’s probably not important. Honestly, I mostly just want to know my blood type. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, it is important. And frankly, quite concerning that you are taking medication prescribed by someone other than myself and cannot recall the name. We need to identify that medication immediately. It could be interacting with your blood pressure medication, or masking a more serious underlying condition. Do you have the pill bottle?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I don't think so. My daughter usually keeps it with her things. She brings it when she visits. I haven’t seen the bottle in… well, I don’t remember how long. She just hands me the pill with a glass of water. I trust her, you see. She’s a very responsible girl. But… maybe I should ask her when she comes next. I didn't realize it was so important to know the name. I just wanted to feel a little better, you see. Is there absolutely no way to find out my blood type without all these tests?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, with all due respect, your daughter is not a medical professional. Taking medication prescribed by someone without my knowledge is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. We need to identify that medication before proceeding with any further discussion about your blood type. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a thyroid panel. And until we know what you’re taking for your “nerves,” I strongly advise you not to take it. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I didn't realize it was such a problem. I just… I get so anxious sometimes. My daughter meant well. She just wants me to be comfortable. I… I don't want to cause any trouble. I understand. You want to know what I’m taking. Yes, of course. I’ll… I’ll ask her when she comes. But… these tests… so many tests… I just wanted to know my blood type. Alright. Do what you think is best, dear. Just… please be gentle. I’m an old woman. I get scared easily.
