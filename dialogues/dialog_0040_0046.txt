DOCTOR: Right, Marialena Creagh. Thirty-one. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Osga. It’s… well, it’s my bladder, I think. I’ve been having a lot of pressure, like I need to go constantly. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive is a good word. It wakes me up at night sometimes, and… well, if I’m out, I really have to plan where the restrooms are. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. It’s not painful, exactly, just… a very urgent feeling, even when there isn’t much there, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Frequent urination… and the urgency even when your bladder isn't full. Alright. Any fever, burning when you urinate, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none of those things. No fever at all. And no burning or blood, no. It really is just the constant pressure and needing to go so often. It’s… frustrating. I drink a normal amount of water, I think. Not excessive, definitely not less than usual.
DOCTOR: Normal water intake… right. And you said this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks, give or take a few days. I initially thought it was just something I ate, or maybe a bit of stress with work, but it hasn't gone away. It feels… persistent. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or routine, not that I can think of, anyway. Would you like me to think harder about that?
DOCTOR: Look, most of the time it’s just a simple urinary tract infection, though you’ve said you haven’t got any of the usual signs. Still, we need to rule things out. Have you had any UTIs before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I’ve never been sick enough to need to go to the doctor for anything like that before. Is a urine sample enough to rule it out, then? I'm happy to provide one, of course.
DOCTOR: A sample is a start. Though frankly, at your age, it’s likely something else entirely. But alright, let’s get that done first. Follow me. The lab technician will tell you what to do. Try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can.
PATIENT: Okay, a mid-stream sample. I think I remember reading about that somewhere. I’ll do my best. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this. It's just… unsettling to have something feel wrong and not know what it is.
DOCTOR: Just collect the sample. We'll go from there. In there. And try not to make a mess.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’ll be careful.
DOCTOR: Thirty-one… no history… probably just anxious. These rural patients... always exaggerating. Still, best to check the results.
PATIENT: .
