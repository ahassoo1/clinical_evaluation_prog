DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It’s not that high, is it? My husband checked it a couple times and... well, I just don't have time for this, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re feeling a bit dismissive of it, and that you’re busy. But even slightly elevated blood pressure can be a sign of something we want to keep an eye on. It's good your husband's been checking it. Can you tell me what readings he was getting, if you remember?
PATIENT: He... let me think. He has that digital one. It was around 140 over... 90, maybe? Something like that. He was worried, naturally, but I told him people get stressed, you know? It goes up. It goes down. It's not a big deal. He likes to worry about everything.
DOCTOR: Right, 140/90. That is a little higher than we like to see consistently. And you’re right, stress can definitely raise your blood pressure temporarily. But it's good we're checking it. To get a better picture, I’d like to take it myself, and then we’ll go over some questions. Have you been feeling any symptoms – headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, chest pain, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I feel perfectly fine. I come here because they tell me I need to, not because I feel like something is wrong. Honestly, I've been busier than usual with work, so maybe that's why it was up a little. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. I'll be quick. If you could just sit here and relax your arm for me, that would be great. While I take your blood pressure, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: It's... engineering. Civil engineering. I do inspections mostly. Bridges, roads, that kind of thing. It’s a lot of driving, a lot of being outside in the heat. And a lot of paperwork, if you can believe it. It's... fine. Just hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, civil engineering, lots of driving and outdoor work… That gives me a better idea. Hmm. 142/92. And your pulse is 78, regular. Okay. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. My family is perfectly healthy. Well, mostly. My aunt had something with her stomach, but that's not the same thing. I’m very careful about what I eat, and I get plenty of sleep when I can. Is that it? Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnosis. That's good to know. Just a few more questions, then we can discuss a plan. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. My husband makes these really spicy chiles sometimes, and they are fantastic. No problems at all. I'm just… a healthy person. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And it’s good to hear you have a good appetite. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Every morning. My mother always told me to take one. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's not often. Can we please get to the point? I have a site inspection scheduled for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well… my grandfather on my mother's side, he… He had something with his heart, I think. He was older, though. Very old. He didn't take care of himself. Smoked a lot, drank a lot. It wasn't a surprise, honestly. It wasn't like it was… a family thing. He just wasn't a good person.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a grandfather with heart issues, but not a strong family history otherwise. And you mentioned being busy with work - how would you describe your typical stress levels?
PATIENT: Stress? It's work. Everyone's stressed. I have deadlines, I have to make sure everything's up to code, I have to deal with… people. It’s normal. I handle it. I don’t sit around complaining about stress. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you don't feel stressed, even though your work sounds demanding. Let’s move on. And just to be thorough, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I don't do any of that. My husband doesn't approve, and frankly, I don't need it. I have a perfectly good life without those things. It's… a waste of time. And unhealthy. Can we please be done now? I'm going to be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. Very good. Just quickly, can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Ugh. Really? Fine. I'm… 5'11", and about 140 pounds. Give or take. It fluctuates. I’m a normal weight. I exercise when I can. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Okay, 5'11", 140 pounds. That gives me a good idea. So, based on what you've told me, and your blood pressure readings, it appears you have what we call Stage 1 Hypertension. It’s not an emergency, but it’s something we need to address to prevent it from getting worse. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. We'll also want to recheck your blood pressure in a few weeks. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? You mean… eat less salt? I already eat healthy. And stress management? Honestly. Look, I don’t have time for a special diet or… whatever. Just give me something to take. A pill. Something easy. I don’t have time to exercise or… manage stress. It’s work. Just write me a prescription, and I'll be on my way. I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you’d prefer a medication. While I can certainly prescribe something, it’s important to understand that medication is often most effective when combined with lifestyle changes. We’ll start with a low dose of Lisinopril, 10mg daily. It’s a common blood pressure medication with relatively few side effects, but it’s crucial to monitor your blood pressure regularly. I’m also going to order some basic blood work – a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel – just to get a baseline and rule out any other underlying issues. Here's the prescription for Lisinopril and the lab order. The lab is just down the hall. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you’re doing. Do you have any questions about the medication or the blood work?
PATIENT: No. I’ll just… go get the blood work done. Four weeks, you said? Fine. Thank you. I need to leave now. Don't bother calling me if there are any… problems. I'll just deal with it.
