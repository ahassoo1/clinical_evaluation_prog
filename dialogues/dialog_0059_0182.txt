DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, well. Doctor, is it? Romario… right. Look, I haven't got all day. I need a signature, a clearance. For a… a little touch-up. My daughter insisted I come. Said I needed to be “approved” before I could… proceed. It’s all a bit much, frankly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you need a medical clearance form completed. That's perfectly alright. To ensure I can complete the form accurately and responsibly, could you tell me a bit more about this "touch-up"?
PATIENT: Responsible? Good grief. It’s a face lift, Doctor. A face lift. I’m eighty-one years old! My face is starting to… droop. It's not a complicated matter. I just want to look… presentable. Is that so difficult to understand? I don’t need a full examination, you know. I'm a perfectly healthy man, all things considered. Used to lay terrazzo for fifty years. Hard work, that was. Built things that lasted. Unlike some things… Anyway, just tell me what you need to sign.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Orwin. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to maintain your appearance, and I’m happy to assist you with this clearance form. While it may seem straightforward, a medical clearance is important to ensure your safety during and after the procedure. It’s standard practice to review your medical history, even for elective surgeries. To begin, could you tell me if you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Heavens, no. I eat a sensible diet – mostly. Though Hilda – my wife, God rest her soul – she always said I liked my salt. A bit of salami now and then. But no problems. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I’ve always been a man of action, always moving. Heart problems… well, I get a little winded climbing stairs these days, but that’s just age. I told you, I laid terrazzo! Fifty years of that. It’s a demanding job. That’s it. Nothing else. Now, can we get this over with? I have a luncheon with the Sons of Norway.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Orwin. It’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy and active. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, let me think… Hilda and I, we were quite fortunate. We avoided the hospital as much as possible. There was that time I sliced my thumb pretty bad on a piece of marble, needed a few stitches. And I broke my wrist when I was younger, falling off a ladder – another terrazzo incident, naturally. But that was ages ago. No serious illnesses, no major operations. Just the usual bumps and bruises a working man gets. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to ask about every little thing? It’s a face lift, not a heart transplant!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin, and I apologize if I’m taking up too much of your time. It's simply my responsibility to gather all the necessary information to ensure your safety. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my arthritis, now and then. Ibuprofen. When it flares up. And a multivitamin, Hilda always insisted on that too. Said I wasn't getting enough fruits and vegetables. She was probably right, to be honest. Other than that… no. Nothing. I don’t believe in filling myself with pills if I can avoid it. It's all a racket, if you ask me. Now, are we finally getting somewhere? The luncheon starts at one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a multivitamin. Thank you. Now, just a few questions about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Never had one in my life. Hilda tried to get me to take a hay fever pill every spring, said I was always sneezing, but I refused. Never bothered me enough to take medication. Just a little sniffle. That’s all. Really, Doctor, are you sure you need all this information for a face lift? It’s becoming quite ridiculous. I’m a sturdy Norwegian, not some delicate flower.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Orwin. It's just that even a relatively minor procedure like a face lift can carry some risks, and it’s my job to minimize those risks as much as possible. One final section – a quick review of your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, good grief. Hilda’s side was…complicated. Lots of cousins and aunts. I barely knew them. My father was a strong man, lived to be ninety, built boats. My mother… she had something with her…gallbladder, I think? Nothing serious. No heart disease, no cancer, as far as I know. We weren’t ones for keeping track of such things. We just…lived our lives. Now, if you’ll excuse me…is this form ready yet? I really must be going. My herring won’t eat itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ve completed the medical clearance form. Here you are. It indicates a generally healthy status, with occasional ibuprofen use for arthritis and a multivitamin. I've noted your statements regarding no significant family history. Before you go, I would like to quickly examine your blood pressure and listen to your heart just to confirm everything is within normal limits. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine me? After all this questioning? Honestly, Doctor, you are being quite…persistent. I told you, I'm a healthy man! But…fine. Get it over with. Quickly, though. I have a schedule to keep. And don’t tell me my blood pressure is too high just to get me to take pills. I’m not falling for that. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. This will only take a moment. Your blood pressure is 140/85. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It's not necessarily cause for concern at your age, but I'd like to document it. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Please open your mouth. Everything looks clear. Here’s the completed form. It notes the slight heart murmur. I recommend informing your surgeon about this, as it may influence their approach. Otherwise, you seem to be in reasonably good health for your age. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A murmur? Heavens to Betsy. I knew it. You doctors are always finding something. A murmur. Honestly. Well, I suppose I'll tell that surgeon. Though, what does he know about terrazzo? Probably nothing. No, I don't have any questions. I’ve wasted enough of my time here today. Thank you – I think – for… documenting my perfectly normal condition. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon to attend. And herring to eat.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I wish you a pleasant luncheon and a speedy recovery. If you experience any unusual symptoms after the procedure, please don’t hesitate to contact your surgeon. Thank you for coming in today. .
