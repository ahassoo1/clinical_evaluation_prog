DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to Delano ALCORTA Clinic. My name is Dr. Janai Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. And it's not a particularly pleasant meeting, I assure you. I’m here because my vision is… deteriorating. Quite rapidly, as a matter of fact. It’s rather inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you for correcting me. And I understand your concern; any change in vision is worrisome, especially when it’s rapid. Can you tell me more about this deterioration?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not something that happened overnight, naturally. Though it feels that way lately. Things have been… fuzzier, I suppose. More difficult to focus on. Reading has become a chore, and I’ve found myself holding things further and further away just to make out the details. It started subtly, months ago, but now… now it's impacting my work, and that simply won’t do. I manage personnel records, you see. Precision is paramount.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a gradual worsening of blurry vision, making it difficult to focus, particularly with reading and close work. And this is now affecting your job. When you say months ago, can you give me a rough estimate – perhaps 3 months, 6 months, or longer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I’d say… closer to six months, perhaps seven. It was so gradual, honestly. I dismissed it as fatigue, stress from the office… the usual nonsense. I should have come sooner, I suppose. But I don’t typically bother doctors unless absolutely necessary. A waste of time, if you ask me. It’s probably just age, anyway. Though, at my age, one should be able to manage things, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to delay seeking medical attention, especially when things develop slowly. And you’re right, vision changes can be a normal part of aging. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. Just to get a better understanding, has this been affecting one eye more than the other, or is it happening equally in both?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I hadn’t really paid attention, to be frank. I suppose… both? It feels… symmetrical, if that makes sense. Not markedly worse in one eye than the other. Though, I do tend to squint more with my left eye, now that I think about it. But that could just be a habit. I’ve always had somewhat sensitive eyes. Sunlight bothers me terribly. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That is helpful to know. The squinting is also good information. Sensitivity to light can be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've always been rather… robust, constitutionally. I eat a sensible diet – mostly. Though, I do enjoy a good steak now and then. And I get plenty of exercise, walking my dogs every morning. As for high blood pressure or… whatever you mentioned, no. Never been diagnosed with anything of the sort. My father had some… heart trouble, late in life, but that was largely due to his poor lifestyle choices, if you ask me. Smoking, drinking… dreadful habits. I avoided those pitfalls.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Alcorta. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been remarkably fortunate in that regard. A few broken bones as a child, naturally – the usual scrapes and bruises. But nothing requiring… serious intervention. I broke my wrist falling off a horse when I was ten, but that healed cleanly, and I haven’t had any issues since. I pride myself on being… self-sufficient. I don’t like being reliant on others, or needing medical attention. It’s a sign of weakness, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Alcorta. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have a… philosophical objection to pharmaceuticals, if you will. I believe the body is perfectly capable of healing itself, given the proper nourishment and rest. I take a daily multivitamin, perhaps, but that’s merely to supplement a healthy diet. I avoid artificial substances whenever possible. It's a matter of principle. And frankly, I don't trust doctors who are too quick to prescribe pills. They rarely address the root cause of the problem.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Alcorta. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. I've always been rather… resilient, constitutionally. A few mosquito bites, perhaps, but nothing serious. I can tolerate most things, truthfully. I've never had a truly debilitating allergic reaction. Though, I avoid shellfish. Not out of allergy, mind you, but simply because I find the taste… unpleasant. It's a matter of personal preference, not medical necessity. Frankly, I suspect most allergies are overblown, a product of modern sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, regarding your family history – do any of your close relatives have any vision problems, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a difficult question. My mother had rather poor eyesight towards the end of her life, but it was attributed to age, naturally. She required thicker and thicker lenses. As for glaucoma or… whatever you mentioned, I’m not certain. We weren’t particularly close, and medical matters were rarely discussed. My father’s side of the family… I know very little about them, truthfully. They were… not the most communicative individuals. It's quite possible someone suffered from those ailments, but I have no concrete information. It's likely irrelevant, in any case.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing what you know, Mr. Alcorta. Now, to get a better understanding of your vision changes, I’d like to perform a brief eye exam. It will involve checking your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and examining the structures of your eyes. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. Though, I must confess, I find these examinations… rather intrusive. Poking and prodding at one’s eyes… it’s hardly a pleasant experience. However, if it’s necessary, I suppose I can endure it. But please be gentle. And try to explain what you’re doing as you go along. I dislike being kept in the dark, as it were. And frankly, if it's going to be a lengthy procedure, I'd like to know beforehand. I have other commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your apprehension, and I will be as gentle as possible. I'll explain each step of the exam as I go along, and it shouldn’t take too long—perhaps 15-20 minutes. I’ll start by checking your visual acuity with a standard eye chart. Please just read the smallest line of letters you can see on the chart. Would you mind covering your left eye with your hand?
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I maintain my skepticism. It’s likely a waste of time, but I’ll indulge your… procedure. Proceed. Though, I warn you, my eyesight has been deteriorating rapidly. Don’t be surprised if I can’t see much at all. And please, try to keep your voice down. I find loud noises… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I will be as quiet as possible. I'm going to hold up this chart with some letters. Please read them to me, starting with the top line, as clearly as you can. Don't strain your eyes. If you can’t see the letters, just tell me. Can you read the first letter on this line for me?
PATIENT: …Is that a… V? Or is it a… B? It’s terribly indistinct. Honestly, it’s quite frustrating. My eyesight was much sharper just last week. This is… concerning. Perhaps I should have come sooner, as you suggested. But I loathe doctors. And these examinations… they’re simply humiliating.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Alcorta. Don’t worry about it. We’re just establishing a baseline. Can you try the next letter?
PATIENT: …Is that… a… D? No, wait… it looks like a… P? Good heavens, this is dreadful. It’s like looking through a fog. Are you certain this chart is properly illuminated? Perhaps it's the lighting. I have a rather sensitive constitution, you see. Bright lights tend to… overwhelm me. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded. This is most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, you seem to be having quite a bit of difficulty, and I don’t want you to strain your eyes. And I apologize if the lighting is bothering you. We can adjust it if you’d like. Before we continue, let's switch eyes. Could you cover your right eye and try reading the letters with your left eye?
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I suspect the result will be the same. My eyesight is deteriorating symmetrically, remember? It’s not a matter of one eye being weaker than the other. It’s a general decline, a… constitutionally-based weakness, perhaps. But proceed, if you must. I'm simply indulging your… procedure. Though, I warn you, I have other commitments. This is taking up valuable time.
DOCTOR: It appears your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes, Mr. Alcorta. Based on this preliminary assessment, it's important we investigate further to determine the underlying cause of this rapid vision loss. I’m going to check your peripheral vision now, and then I’ll use some instruments to examine the internal structures of your eyes. It’s going to involve some drops to dilate your pupils, which will temporarily blur your vision, and a close look with a special microscope. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Drops? Dilate my pupils? Good heavens. This is becoming increasingly… intrusive. Temporarily blur my vision? I have a rather important appointment this afternoon, you know. And I detest having my vision impaired in any way. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is all quite… unsettling. But… very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. But please be quick. And explain everything you’re doing, in detail. I dislike surprises. And if it involves any poking or prodding, I expect a full explanation beforehand. This is… most inconvenient. Proceed, but with utmost caution.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. The drops will temporarily blur your vision for a few hours, so you won't be able to drive afterwards. I'll explain each step as I go. These drops will take about 15-20 minutes to fully dilate your pupils. While we wait, I’ll ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Have you noticed any floaters or flashes of light in your vision?
PATIENT: Floaters? Flashes of light? Good heavens, no. I’ve noticed a general blurring, a reduction in acuity, a symmetrical decline in vision. Not… floaters. And certainly not flashes of light. Honestly, Doctor, I find your questions… imprecise. You ask about specific symptoms that I haven’t experienced. I’ve already explained the situation: a gradual, yet rapid, deterioration in vision. It’s hardly a nuanced issue. And please, try not to use such… medical jargon. It’s quite disconcerting. This is… most unsettling. And I believe my vision is becoming even more blurred. I trust this won’t take much longer.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Alcorta. My apologies for being imprecise. I'm trying to gather as much information as possible to get a clear picture of what's going on. The blurring is what we are investigating. While we wait for the drops to take effect, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you've had, even if they seem unrelated?
PATIENT: Other medical conditions? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve already told you: I’m remarkably robust. I’ve never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries, never required any… serious intervention. A few broken bones as a child, naturally. But nothing that would… impact my vision. I pride myself on my constitution. I eat a sensible diet, get plenty of exercise, avoid artificial substances. I am, quite frankly, a paragon of health. This… deterioration is most perplexing. And I believe my vision is becoming even more blurred. Are you certain these drops are… safe?
DOCTOR: These drops are very safe, Mr. Alcorta, and are routinely used to examine the retina. They simply allow me to get a better view of the internal structures of your eye. Now, while the drops are taking effect, let me ask you about your family history again. Knowing if anyone in your family had glaucoma, macular degeneration, or other eye problems can sometimes help us understand what's going on. Even if you're not certain, any information would be helpful.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’ve already told you: I know very little about my family history. My mother had rather poor eyesight towards the end of her life, but it was attributed to age, naturally. As for glaucoma or… whatever you mentioned, I’m not certain. We weren’t particularly close, and medical matters were rarely discussed. My father’s side of the family… they were… not the most communicative individuals. It's quite possible someone suffered from those ailments, but I have no concrete information. It's irrelevant, frankly. A waste of time, really. And I believe my vision is deteriorating rapidly. I'm starting to feel quite anxious. Is there anything… anything at all… you can tell me? A preliminary diagnosis? A possible cause? Anything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it's understandable that you're feeling anxious, and I apologize for not being able to provide a definitive diagnosis at this point. It's too early to say for certain what's causing your vision loss, as I haven't been able to fully examine your eyes yet. However, based on your symptoms – the rapid onset of blurry vision in both eyes, and the fact that it doesn’t seem to be associated with any other symptoms – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. These could include inflammation inside the eye, a problem with blood flow to the optic nerve, or, less commonly, a neurological condition. The examination I’m about to perform will help me narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. It’s important to rule out anything serious, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to find out what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Inflammation? Blood flow? Neurological conditions? Good heavens. This is… most unsettling. Frankly, Doctor, you’re not alleviating my anxieties; you’re exacerbating them. And frankly, I detest uncertainty. I prefer concrete answers, definitive diagnoses, clear courses of action. This… vague speculation is simply unacceptable. And frankly, I have a rather important appointment this afternoon. I’m expected at a… business engagement. A rather crucial matter, you see. Will these… examinations delay me significantly? And will they… impair my vision further? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Is there anything… anything at all… you can do to expedite this process? And frankly, what are the chances of a… complete recovery? Is there any possibility of… blindness?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Alcorta, and I apologize for causing you further anxiety. I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to expedite the process and minimize any discomfort. The examination itself will take approximately 15-20 minutes once the drops have fully dilated your pupils. I'll use a special instrument to look at the back of your eye, which will allow me to assess the health of your retina and optic nerve. It won't cause any pain, but it may be a little uncomfortable. Regarding the possibility of a complete recovery, it's too early to say for certain. The outcome will depend on the underlying cause of your vision loss. In some cases, vision can be fully restored with treatment, while in others, some degree of vision loss may be permanent. Regarding the possibility of blindness, that is a very rare outcome, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to prevent that from happening. I will perform a thorough examination to determine the underlying cause of your vision loss and recommend the best course of treatment. I understand your appointment this afternoon is important, and I will do everything I can to get you out of here as quickly as possible without compromising the quality of the examination. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed, if you must. But please be quick. And gentle. And explain everything you’re doing, in detail. I dislike surprises. And if it involves any… poking or prodding, I expect a full explanation beforehand. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite faint. And frankly, I expect a clear diagnosis at the conclusion of this… ordeal. A definitive answer. A course of action. Anything less is… unacceptable. But please, be quick. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll start by shining a light into your eye to get a better view of the retina. I’ll be looking for any signs of inflammation, bleeding, or other abnormalities. I’m going to ask you to focus on a specific point in the room while I examine each eye. This may feel a little strange, but it won’t cause any pain. Now, just focus on that point on the wall, Mr. Alcorta. And try to relax. This may take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is… most unpleasant. The light is… dazzling. And it’s causing a rather intense headache. Are you certain this is necessary? And frankly, I’m not seeing anything. Everything is… blurry. Intensely, excruciatingly blurry. Are you seeing anything at all? Or are you simply… poking and prodding at my eye in the darkness? This is… most unsettling. And frankly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Are we… finished yet?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I apologize. I realize this is causing you discomfort, and I will stop immediately. It seems we are not getting a clear view, and I don’t want to cause you any further distress. It appears the drops haven’t dilated your pupils sufficiently to get a good view of your retina. This is preventing me from getting a clear diagnosis. I recommend we postpone the examination until tomorrow, and I can prescribe a stronger dilating agent. In the meantime, I recommend you rest your eyes and avoid any strenuous activity. I’ll also give you a referral to an ophthalmologist for a second opinion. They may have additional testing methods to help determine the underlying cause of your vision loss. I understand this is not the outcome you were hoping for, but I believe it’s important to get a clear diagnosis before proceeding with any treatment. Are you comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: A stronger dilating agent? Another day of… uncertainty? Another appointment? Frankly, Doctor, this is… unacceptable. I have a rather crucial business engagement this afternoon, you see. And I detest delays. Very well. Proceed with the stronger dilating agent, if you must. But I expect a definitive diagnosis at the conclusion of this… ordeal. A clear course of action. Anything less is… simply unacceptable. And frankly, I expect a referral to a… competent ophthalmologist. Someone who can provide a clear answer, without further delays. But please, be quick. And gentle. And try not to… poke and prod at my eye in the darkness. This is… most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I will write you a prescription for a stronger dilating agent. This should help to dilate your pupils more effectively, allowing me to get a better view of your retina. I will also provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. She specializes in retinal diseases and has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating complex vision problems. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible. She'll be able to perform additional testing methods, such as optical coherence tomography, to help determine the underlying cause of your vision loss. In the meantime, I recommend you rest your eyes and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, such as severe pain, flashes of light, or floaters, please seek immediate medical attention. I understand this is not the outcome you were hoping for, but I believe it’s important to get a clear diagnosis before proceeding with any treatment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Optical coherence tomography… another test. Another delay. Frankly, Doctor, this is becoming… increasingly frustrating. No. I have no further questions. I expect a definitive diagnosis at my appointment with Dr. Vance. A clear course of action. Anything less is… simply unacceptable. Good day, Doctor. And frankly, I hope I do not have to return to this… establishment again. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your frustration, and I sincerely hope Dr. Vance is able to provide you with a definitive diagnosis and a clear course of action. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I wish you all the best. .
