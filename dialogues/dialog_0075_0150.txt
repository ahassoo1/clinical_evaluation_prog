DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Honestly, I don't have time for a lot of chit-chat. I'm 51, divorced, and I want to be clear – I want to get pregnant. And I want to do it easily. I don’t want any…complications. Is that possible? Because frankly, I’ve heard horror stories.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Shteynberg, and I appreciate your directness. Getting pregnant at 51 does present some challenges, but it is possible. We’ll certainly explore all options and work to minimize any complications. First, let's get some background. Have you been trying for a while now, or is this a recent decision?
PATIENT: Recent decision. Very recent. And frankly, I find the idea of “trying” insulting. I don’t try at things. I do them. But no, haven't been…actively pursuing anything, if that's what you mean. I just figured…well, I figured it should be straightforward. I’m in good health, mostly. Don’t get sick often. And I take care of myself. Bicycle repair keeps you quite fit, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. That's helpful to know. And bicycle repair is good exercise! Since this is a recent decision and you haven't been actively trying, it’s important we start with a thorough assessment to understand your current health status and potential obstacles. To begin, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Obstacles? Honestly. Look, I haven't got a long medical history. I broke my wrist once, falling off a very poorly maintained cobblestone street in Budapest. And I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was…ages ago. Nothing serious. I don't do serious. I have Medicare, if that's relevant. And I have a very high tolerance for pain. Really. Don't bother asking.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No major medical issues, that’s excellent. And thank you for letting me know about your pain tolerance—that’s always good information. Since this is a new undertaking for you, and at your age, we need to be quite comprehensive. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family. That’s…a complicated subject. My mother had a touch of arthritis, I suppose. And my grandfather… he was a bit eccentric. Spent most of his life collecting stamps. Not exactly a medical condition, is it? My aunt… she had a rather unfortunate incident with a beehive. But again, not relevant. Honestly, we weren’t a very…healthy bunch. More…interesting. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize if these questions seem repetitive. Even seemingly minor details can be helpful. It helps us build a complete picture. Stamp collecting won't impact anything, but knowing about potential genetic predispositions is important. Okay, let's move on then. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. I’ve travelled extensively, you know. I’ve sampled delicacies from every corner of the globe. I don’t…fuss. I’m a very robust individual. And I certainly don't react to…things. Honestly, the only thing I have a slight aversion to is poorly maintained bicycles.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s good to hear. No known allergies is excellent. Now, let's talk about any medications you currently take – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements. Anything at all.
PATIENT: Medications? None. Absolutely none. I don’t believe in…interfering with the natural order of things. I eat a good diet, I get plenty of exercise, and I repair bicycles. That’s all I need. I might occasionally take a vitamin C tablet when I’m feeling a little…run down, but that’s it. And it’s hardly a medication. It’s a…boost.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional Vitamin C. That’s very good. Now, to get a clearer picture of your current health status, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting personal. Honestly. I occasionally enjoy a glass of good Hungarian wine with dinner. A good wine, mind you. Not that cheap stuff. And I certainly don’t “use recreational drugs”. I have standards. Smoking? Absolutely not. Ruins your lungs, and frankly, it’s terribly uncouth. I lead a very…refined life. Despite the bicycles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if I’m being too intrusive. I simply need to gather all the relevant information. So, occasional glass of Hungarian wine – noted. To proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic abdominal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. A practical step. Honestly, all this questioning is rather…unproductive. Yes, yes, examine away. But please be gentle. I have important work to do, you know. Bicycles don’t repair themselves. And I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat here, and we’ll get started. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this stage. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m noting a slight increase in weight since your last visit with your primary care physician, according to your EHR. 86 kilograms, is that correct?
PATIENT: EHR? Look, I don't care about…electronic health records. And yes, 86 kilograms. I've been…enjoying life a little more lately. Good food, good wine. It’s important. Bicycles are strenuous work, you know. A woman needs sustenance. But that doesn’t mean I’m unhealthy. It just means I’m…well-nourished. Now, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we going to continue with this endless series of…inquiries?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. Weight gain is not necessarily a concern, but it’s something we should monitor. Okay. Given your age and desire to become pregnant, I recommend some baseline blood tests to assess your hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and overall health. We’ll also want to check your thyroid function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? Ovarian…what now? Honestly, it’s all becoming terribly complicated. Look, I just want to know if I can get pregnant, and if so, what I need to do to make it happen quickly and efficiently. Is that too much to ask? Blood tests…fine. But I expect results promptly. I have a business to run. And if there’s any…bad news, I want to know it straight away. No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your desire for a quick and efficient process, and I assure you, I will provide you with results as promptly as possible. We’ll run the tests today, and I’ll have the results back to you within a week. In the meantime, I would also like to discuss the possibility of a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist. They specialize in fertility issues and can provide more specialized care. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A…reproductive what now? Look, I came to a general practitioner. I didn’t ask for a specialist. Frankly, I find the idea rather…intimidating. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, isn't this something you can handle? I don't want to be shuffled off to a dozen different doctors. I just want a straightforward answer. Can we at least get the blood test results before we start talking about referrals?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Shteynberg. You are right to want a straightforward approach. We can certainly wait for the blood test results before discussing a referral. However, given your age and desire for pregnancy, a reproductive endocrinologist has specialized expertise that can significantly improve your chances of success. I will order the blood tests now, and we will discuss the results, and the possibility of a referral, next week. In the meantime, I recommend starting a prenatal vitamin with folic acid. It’s a good preventative measure. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Prenatal vitamin…fine. Whatever. Just…get the tests done. And make sure they’re expedited. I haven’t got all day to wait. And please, no more talk about specialists until we have results. Frankly, the whole thing is rather…stressful. Bicycles are much less complicated. Right. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ve expedited the tests, and they should be ready within a week. I will call you as soon as they are available. Please take this form to the lab. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we’ll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, Ms. Shteynberg.
PATIENT: Hmph. .
