DOCTOR: Alright, Evann Buoniconti, 35 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Billman. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I was advised – by my solicitor, I believe – to inquire about… forms. Something to do with making wishes known, in case… well, in case something should happen. I believe they called it an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I confess, the details are… fuzzy. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Right. Forms. Solicitor involved. Okay. Look, let's be clear. I’m a doctor, not a… legal advisor. But I can certainly help you with Advance Directives and POLST forms. It’s good you’re thinking about this stuff, honestly. A lot of people don’t. So, you’re wanting to document what kind of medical care you want if you're unable to speak for yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. That sounds… correct. Unable to speak for myself. That is the gist of it, isn’t it? I… I don’t recall the specifics of why my solicitor suggested this now. Something about… unforeseen circumstances? It feels… distant. I simply want to ensure my wishes are known, if that makes sense. And I trust you to… guide me through the process. Is there a questionnaire, perhaps? Or… do we simply talk? I am rather unsure of the procedure.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to worry, we can absolutely take it slow. There is a questionnaire, but honestly, just talking is usually the best way to start. It helps me understand you and what's important to you. Before we get into specific wishes, let's just run through a little bit of your medical history, okay?
PATIENT: Certainly. That sounds… sensible. My medical history… hmm. I'm afraid I don’t have a great recollection of… frequent doctor’s visits. I generally feel… quite well. I’ve always been… slender, as you can see. No major illnesses, to my knowledge. I had the usual childhood immunizations, I believe. And a routine dental check-up yearly, of course. Beyond that… I’m drawing a blank. Is there anything specific you’d like to know? Perhaps if you name a condition, I might recall if I've been affected?
DOCTOR: Okay, well the record here is… sparse. That's fine. Let's start with allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, insects… anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't believe so. No, I don't recall any allergic reactions. I occasionally have… a slight sensitivity to strong perfumes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? It just makes me sneeze. And I avoid bee stings, naturally. But beyond that… I’m fairly certain I am without allergies. It's… odd, isn't it? Most people seem to be allergic to something. Perhaps I am simply lucky?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. How about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Currently, I take nothing regularly. Not a single thing. Occasionally, if I have a particularly stubborn headache, I might take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think? Or perhaps acetaminophen. But that’s… infrequent. Perhaps once or twice a year. And I don’t take anything else. No prescriptions, no supplements… nothing. I try to maintain a… natural approach, when possible. Is that… sufficient information?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Fine. Let's talk about your family history. Any major illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… a difficult question. My parents… they are both… gone now. And I wasn’t particularly close to… extended family. I believe my mother… she had some… heart trouble, towards the end. But the specifics escape me. My father… he was a very stoic man. He didn’t speak much of… ailments. He always insisted on… maintaining a brave face. I'm afraid I don't have a great deal of information to offer. Is it crucial? Perhaps we could… revisit this later? I feel… rather unhelpful.
DOCTOR: It's… helpful to know, yes. But we can circle back to it. Alright. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never. I find the habit… distasteful. And rather unhealthy, naturally. I’ve always been… very conscious of my well-being. Both physical and… mental. I do enjoy a glass of wine occasionally, with dinner. But I wouldn’t consider myself a… heavy drinker. A social indulgence, perhaps. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay. Wine occasionally. That’s… good to know. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Doctor Billman, I assure you, no. I have never… indulged in such activities. I am a… rather focused individual. I dedicate my time to my work. Etching and engraving… it requires a steady hand and a clear mind. I find… other outlets for relaxation. Music, reading… quiet contemplation. Recreational drugs have never been… part of my life. I apologize if that sounds… abrupt. It simply isn’t something I have ever considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recreational drugs. Good. So, you said you work… etching and engraving?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. I own a small studio. It’s… a solitary profession, for the most part. I create… bespoke designs. Jewelry, small sculptures… decorative pieces. It requires a great deal of… patience and precision. I find it… deeply satisfying. It allows me to… express my creativity. I’ve been doing it… for many years now. It’s… my passion. Although, it does keep me indoors rather a lot. And I confess, I often forget to… eat regularly when I am engrossed in a project. A rather unfortunate habit, I suppose. But I digress. Is there anything specific you’d like to know about my work? Perhaps it’s irrelevant to… our current discussion?
DOCTOR: Right. So, solitary work, often forgetting to eat. Okay. Let's get back to the medical side of things. You said your mother had heart trouble. Do you know what kind?
PATIENT: Heart trouble… Hmm. It was… some form of… insufficiency, I believe. That’s what my solicitor mentioned, when… advising me about these forms. She said my mother… required frequent hospital visits towards the end. And… medication, of course. But the specifics… escape me. It was several years ago now. I was rather… preoccupied with my own work at the time. I apologize for my lack of clarity. I wish I could offer more… concrete details. My solicitor suggested it might be relevant… due to a potential… hereditary component? But I truly don't recall the particulars. Is it… crucial information? Perhaps we could focus on… my current state of health?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Buoniconti, I appreciate you’re trying to be helpful, but this is important. Family history is crucial. Knowing what your mother had helps me understand your risk factors. Was it congestive heart failure?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? I… believe so. Yes. That sounds… right. My solicitor did mention… fluid retention. And shortness of breath. She said my mother… struggled to climb stairs towards the end. It was… very distressing. I… I remember visiting her in the hospital. She was… quite weak. But the details are… fragmented. It was several years ago now. And I… I confess, I tend to… block out unpleasant memories. Is that… a common reaction? I apologize for my… vagueness. I truly am trying to… assist you. But my recollection is… remarkably poor. It’s… frustrating, to say the least. Perhaps… focusing on my current health, as I suggested, would be more… productive?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Congestive heart failure in your mother. Good to know. Let's do a quick physical exam then. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Although, I must warn you, I’m rather… unsteady on my feet sometimes. Spending long hours bent over my workbench… it’s not conducive to… optimal posture. And I haven’t been particularly… active lately. I apologize in advance for any… wobbling. Perhaps I should have worn… sturdier shoes. But please, proceed. I trust your… professional judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little high, but not drastically so. Let me check your extremities. Pulses are… weak. Okay. Let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly. I… believe I am. Although, my vision isn’t quite as sharp as it once was. Spending so many hours focusing on… minute details… it takes a toll, I suppose. And I occasionally experience… blurry vision when I am… fatigued. Is everything… alright, Doctor Billman? You seem… rather concerned. Are my reflexes… abnormally diminished? And what do you mean by… weak pulses? Is there something… amiss? I apologize for my… anxiousness. But I do become… easily flustered when confronted with… medical terminology. And I confess, my lack of… detailed knowledge is rather disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Buoniconti, you’re not “flustered,” and it’s okay to ask questions. Your pulses are weaker than I’d like, and your reflexes are diminished. It could be due to a number of things – inactivity, dehydration, even just your age. But given your mother’s history of heart failure, and your elevated blood pressure, I want to be cautious. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid panel. I also want you to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And finally, I'd like a chest X-ray to rule out any fluid in your lungs. Does that sound… agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds agreeable. Though, I confess, the list is… rather extensive. Blood work, a lipid panel… and a chest X-ray? It sounds… rather serious. Is there something… gravely wrong, Doctor Billman? I apologize for my… persistence. But I do become… anxious when confronted with… potential health concerns. And the terminology is… rather overwhelming, as you know. Perhaps if you could… explain the purpose of each test in… layman’s terms? That would… alleviate my anxieties somewhat. And… when will I receive the results? And what will they… indicate? I truly appreciate your… patience, Doctor. This is… rather disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Look, let's not jump to conclusions. These tests are preventative. The blood work will tell us about your kidney function, your liver function, your blood sugar, and your cholesterol levels. The lipid panel specifically looks at your cholesterol. The thyroid panel will check if your thyroid is functioning properly. And the chest X-ray will just make sure there’s no fluid buildup in your lungs. It's standard procedure, especially given your family history. We're just being thorough. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. The X-ray results should be back sooner. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and decide on a plan. Does that sound… better?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds better. “Preventative,” you say? That… alleviates my anxieties somewhat. Though, the terminology is… still rather overwhelming. “Kidney function,” “liver function”… it’s all rather… abstract. But I trust your… professional judgment. 24-48 hours. And then a follow-up appointment. Very well. Doctor Billman, regarding the Advance Directive and POLST form… will the results of these tests… affect my ability to… complete them? Or… will they necessitate a change in… my wishes? I apologize for my… persistent questioning. But I do believe it’s important to… understand the implications of each test. And I truly want to… ensure my wishes are known, should… unforeseen circumstances arise. As my solicitor advised.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Buoniconti, let's take this one step at a time. Right now, we're focusing on gathering information. The results of these tests will help us understand your overall health. Then we can discuss the Advance Directive and POLST form and whether any changes need to be made. We can revisit your wishes after we have a clearer picture of your health. Trying to anticipate that now is… premature. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds reasonable. One step at a time. My solicitor always said I was… prone to overthinking. Perhaps she was right. Very well. One step at a time. Doctor Billman… will I be… alright? Is there… cause for serious concern? I apologize for my… anxiety. But I do become… easily flustered when confronted with… potential health issues. And I truly want to… ensure my well-being. As much as possible.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Buoniconti, it’s okay to be anxious. And it's good you’re asking these questions. Right now, it’s too early to say definitively whether there’s cause for serious concern. That’s why we’re running these tests. We’re going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and make sure you’re healthy. Let’s just focus on getting these tests done. And then we’ll talk. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes. Let's… focus on the tests. Thank you, Doctor Billman. For your… patience. And for… explaining everything so… thoroughly. I truly appreciate your… kindness. Perhaps… I should schedule an appointment for the blood work and the X-ray? And then… return for a follow-up appointment? As you advised.
