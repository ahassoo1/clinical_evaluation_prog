DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter about being assessed for… home health care, I believe? And, uh, hospice eligibility. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what that all means for me, but I figured it was best to come in and find out. I’m Calin Sachar, by the way.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sachar. It’s good you came in to discuss this. It can be unsettling receiving a letter like that without a clear understanding of what it entails. The letter is likely related to a recent health assessment, and the mention of home health care and hospice eligibility is a precautionary step to ensure you receive the appropriate level of support, if needed. To best understand your situation, let's start with a bit more detail about your overall health. Could you tell me about any current health problems you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Right… well, things haven’t been easy lately. I work as a presser, you know, in a garment factory. It's…physical work. And my back, it's been giving me trouble for months now. A sharp pain, mostly when I’m standing or bending. I’ve been trying to manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers, but they aren't doing much anymore. Honestly, it’s just getting worse and worse. And… sometimes I feel really tired, even after a full night’s sleep. It’s hard to explain. Just… worn out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Back pain that’s interfering with your work and fatigue… that certainly sounds concerning. You mentioned the pain is sharp, and worsens with standing and bending. Can you tell me where exactly on your back you're feeling the pain?
PATIENT: It’s mostly right here, lower, lower back. And it sometimes shoots down my leg, you know? Not always, but it happens. Mostly on my right side. It feels like… a pinching. And it’s worse at the end of the day, after a long shift. Standing for hours… it just makes everything ache. It’s hard to even sit comfortably sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain radiating down your right leg… that description is helpful. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's not constant, no. It comes and goes. Some days are better than others. But even on the ‘better’ days, there's always a dull ache there. It's when I'm active that it really flares up. Lifting things at work, bending over… that’s when it becomes sharp and intense. And it tends to stay that way for a few hours afterwards, even with the pain relievers.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any specific activities that relieve the pain, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, lying down usually helps. Especially flat on my back. And if I put a warm compress on it, that eases it a little. It doesn’t make it go away completely, but it takes the edge off. Honestly… not much else does. Sitting still is about it, really. But I have to work, you know? I can’t just sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's good to know what provides some relief, even if temporary. Now, let's move on to some other things. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… sometimes. Not all the time, but yeah, I get a tingling sensation in my toes, mostly on my right foot. It comes and goes, like the pain. Weakness… not really weakness, but sometimes it feels… heavy. Like it’s harder to lift my foot. It doesn’t happen often, but it's there. I just figured it was from being on my feet all day, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling and a feeling of heaviness in your right foot… that’s important information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s a… personal question, isn’t it? To be honest, yes. I’ve been… constipated lately. It’s not a pleasant topic, but it’s been happening. And… I have to go to the bathroom more frequently, but sometimes it’s hard to… fully empty my bladder. I hadn't really thought much of it, just put it down to stress.
DOCTOR: It is personal, and I apologize if it made you uncomfortable. These questions are important, though, to get a complete picture of your health. Changes in bowel or bladder function can sometimes be related to back pain, and it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I go to the doctor when I need to, but usually it’s just for a cold or the flu. I had really bad migraines when I was younger, but those stopped years ago. And… I had a surgery on my appendix when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, I’m generally healthy. I try to eat well, you know? And I try to stay active, even though my back is giving me trouble now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother on my father’s side had arthritis, really bad arthritis in her hands. But other than that, not much that I know of. Nobody in my family has had any serious illnesses, as far as I’m aware. It’s a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen. I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes I'll take something for a headache, but that's about it. And I definitely haven’t been taking anything for my back other than those. They just don't seem to be helping much anymore, which is why I came in.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't ever had any trouble with medications or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on and get some relief. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on your back on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. After that, I’ll need you to do a few simple movements so I can assess your back. Let me know if anything feels painful during the exam. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Can you bend your knees and let your legs relax?
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes on both sides. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength in both hands. Now, let’s move on to your back. Can you point to the area where you’re feeling the most pain?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s mostly in this area. And sometimes it radiates down my right leg, like I mentioned. It feels worse when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting some tenderness here, and a slight muscle spasm on your right side. Now, I’d like you to slowly bend forward and try to touch your toes. Only go as far as is comfortable. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… uncomfortable. I can't go much further. It feels like something is pinching in my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you try to stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: It's… difficult. I feel a bit unsteady. And it hurts in my back when I do that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you try walking on your heels for a few steps?
PATIENT: This is… really hard. And it's causing pain in my back. It feels like it’s putting a lot of strain on my muscles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you’re exhibiting signs consistent with a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by your work. The pain radiating down your leg, along with the tingling and changes in bowel/bladder function, do warrant further investigation, however. To rule out any nerve compression or other underlying issues, I recommend we order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds sensible. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. Is it… a painful procedure?
DOCTOR: No, an MRI isn’t painful at all. You’ll lie inside a large magnet, and it takes some time to get the images. It can be a little noisy and you'll need to remain very still, but it's a completely non-invasive procedure. In the meantime, I’d like to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to help manage the pain and spasm. I'll also recommend some physical therapy. Before I finalize everything, do you have any questions for me, Ms. Sachar?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… that sounds good. Physical therapy too, yes. Um… about the physical therapy… what does that involve? Will it be… strenuous? And… will it be covered by insurance? I don't have insurance at the moment, so I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Sachar. Physical therapy typically involves exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your flexibility, and reduce pain. It will start with gentle exercises and gradually increase in intensity as your strength improves. We will also work on proper body mechanics to prevent future injuries. As for the cost, unfortunately, without insurance, it can be quite expensive. I can provide you with a list of physical therapy clinics in the area that offer a sliding scale fee based on income, or a payment plan option. We also have a social worker here at the clinic who can assist you with finding financial assistance programs. I'll also give you a prescription for the muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory. It’s important to take them as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. And I will put in the order for the MRI. You'll receive a call from the radiology department to schedule your appointment. Does that all make sense, Ms. Sachar?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. The sliding scale fee and the social worker… that's very helpful to know. I appreciate you taking the time to go over all of that with me. So, just to be clear… I’ll get a call about the MRI, and then I’ll need to find a physical therapy clinic that offers a sliding scale fee. And I’ll take the prescription you’re giving me. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ve got it. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation, including the prescriptions, the referral for the MRI, and a list of physical therapy clinics and resources for financial assistance. I want to stress that it's important to contact me if your pain worsens, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or a fever. I'm optimistic that we can get your pain under control and help you get back to doing the things you enjoy, Ms. Sachar. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what steps we’re taking to address it. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sachar. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I’ll have my nurse come in to review the discharge instructions with you and give you the prescriptions. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
