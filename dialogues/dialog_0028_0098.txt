DOCTOR: Right. Demondre Heindel, 25 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor Memmolo. Just...curiosity, really. I ain't really sick sick. Just wanted to check things out. Make sure everything's workin' like it should, you know? I been on the boats a while now and... well, it got me thinkin'.
DOCTOR: “Curiosity.” Right. Well, preventative care is…acceptable, I suppose. Though usually people come when something is broken. “Boats,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, boats. I’m a sailor…and kinda help with the engines, oilin’ stuff. It's hard work, but it pays the bills. We go all over, mostly around the Gulf. It just…you hear stories, you know? And bein' away from a real doctor makes you wonder. Is that...weird?
DOCTOR: No, it's not…ideal. Sailors and engines. A strange combination. Alright. Let's just…go through the motions, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. What kinda motions? Like, checkin' my heart and stuff? I ain't got no problems I know of, but I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Just tell me what's happenin' as we go, okay? I don't really understand all the doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Naturally. Well, we’ll start with a basic history. Have you had any…significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…significant? Not that I remember. When I was a little kid, I had chickenpox, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, fallin' outta a tree. But nothin' serious since then. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I eat alright, get enough sleep when I can… it's mostly just hard work. Does that count as somethin'?
DOCTOR: A broken arm and chickenpox. Remarkable. And you say you “eat alright”?
PATIENT: Yeah, like… normal food. Not too much junk. Fish a lot, when we catch it. Rice, beans, stuff like that. My ex-wife was a good cook, so I learned to eat pretty well. She made sure of it, anyway. Not that it matters now. Is there somethin' wrong with what I'm sayin'? I’m tryin’ to be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, it’s just…vague. Let’s move on. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. Not even for the broken arm. Just a cast. They wrapped it up real good and I was good to go. I don't like hospitals. Or… doctors, really. No offense.
DOCTOR: None taken. Family history then. Any… illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. I didn’t really know my dad that well, and my mom... she passed away a few years back. I don't really remember her talkin' about anythin' like that. Just… normal old people stuff, I guess. Arthritis, maybe? She had trouble with her hands sometimes. And her sister had… I think it was high blood pressure. But that’s all I can really remember, honestly. It wasn't somethin' we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Convenient. Alright. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mom always said it was a bad habit, and… well, she was usually right. I drink sometimes. Just a beer or two after work, though. Never anything crazy.
DOCTOR: Alcohol... noted. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I ain't had to take much medicine over the years, thankfully. Maybe some aspirin for a headache now and then, but nothin' serious. I just try to tough it out, usually. Does penicillin count? I think I remember bein' a little sick after takin' somethin' with that in it when I was a kid. But it was a long time ago, so I could be wrong.
DOCTOR: “Might” be allergic to penicillin. Wonderful. Let’s move on to a physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. What’s it gonna involve? I don't really like bein' poked and prodded, if you don't mind. Just tell me what you're doin’ as you go, okay? Like before. And... maybe go easy on me?
DOCTOR: It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a basic abdominal examination. Standard procedure. And I assure you, it’s not meant to be… unpleasant. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay... that wasn't so bad. Felt a little cold, but nothin' awful. So far so good, huh? Everything sounds okay? I ain't hearin' no…murmurs or whatever you said. That's a good thing, right?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally in upper and lower extremities. No focal neurological deficits noted. Yes. Everything appears normal. For now.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s good, right? “Appears” normal? What does that mean? Is somethin’ wrong? You said I was fine a minute ago, and now you say “appears?” I’m startin’ to get worried. Maybe I shoulda just stayed on the boat…
DOCTOR: It means that based on a cursory examination, there are no immediately obvious issues. But that does not preclude the possibility of underlying conditions. You requested a check-up, not a comprehensive diagnosis. It's just…prudent to not overreact. Do you have any current complaints?
PATIENT: But... I told you I just wanted to check things out! I don’t have complaints! That’s the whole point! So you're sayin’ there's nothin’ wrong with me, but maybe somethin’ could be wrong? That don't make a whole lot of sense. Look, I appreciate you checkin' me out, but… maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I feel more confused now than I did before. Is there a bill for this?
DOCTOR: There is a standard consultation fee. And as I stated, a general check-up does not eliminate the possibility of underlying issues. If you are concerned, you may consider further testing. I can order a comprehensive blood panel. Or you can simply continue your activities and return if symptoms develop. It’s your decision.
PATIENT: Blood panel? More money? No, thank you. I think I’m good. I’m gonna go. I appreciate your time, Doctor, but… this ain't what I expected. Actually… maybe just tell me how much the bill is, and I’ll take it from there. I’m gettin’ a headache now, and I think I need some fresh air. .
DOCTOR: The fee is $150. A statement will be mailed to your address on file. Goodbye. Another one…
