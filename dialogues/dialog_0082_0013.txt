DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s…trouble with going to the bathroom, mostly. I have a hard time…getting it all out, if you know what I mean. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying. That is something we should take a look at. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe six, seven months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little bit of…left-behind pee, you know? But it’s gotten worse slowly. Now, sometimes it feels like I just…can't push it out all the way. It’s…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months…gradual onset…okay. And is it difficult to start the stream of urine, or is it more trouble finishing?
PATIENT: It's not hard to start, no. It comes pretty easy. It’s definitely more trouble finishing. Like…it feels like it just…stops before it's really empty. I have to…strain a little, and even then, I don't always feel like I get everything out. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright, so normal initiation, difficulty with complete emptying, and some straining. Have you noticed any changes in the strength of the stream itself?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. It feels…weaker, maybe? Not a big change, but it doesn’t feel as strong as it used to. It used to be pretty steady, and now it sort of…tapers off towards the end. I’m not sure if that’s just because I’m older, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Hilber. A weakening stream is certainly something to consider. And are you experiencing any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. It doesn't hurt at all, thankfully. It’s just…frustrating, you know? And a little worrying, because my…well, my wife, God rest her soul, she had some trouble with her bladder before she got sick. So I get a little nervous when things start acting up down there.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your wife's history. We’ll certainly investigate this thoroughly. Do you happen to know if she had any specific diagnosis related to her bladder issues?
PATIENT: She…well, the doctor said something about her bladder not emptying completely, and she had to…go to the bathroom a lot, even after she’d just gone. I don't remember the exact name of it, I’m sorry. It was a long time ago, and I was mostly just trying to take care of her. She had to…catheterize sometimes, if I remember right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more to work with. Frequent urination and incomplete emptying…those symptoms can overlap with a few different conditions. Catheterization suggests it may have been more significant. Now, aside from the bladder issues, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I figure. And my knees ache, but…well, that's just life. Nothing else that I've noticed. I try to eat right, mostly fish and berries when I can get them. I don’t drink a lot of sugary drinks, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other significant changes. That's good. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I don’t take many medicines, either. Just a little something for my blood pressure, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just medication for blood pressure. What’s the name and dosage of that medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see…it’s a little white pill. I think it’s…Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. And it’s…10 milligrams, I believe. I take one every morning. My wife used to keep track of everything, but…well, it’s been a while since she was here to do that.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your abdomen and…well, a brief neurological exam just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen and then feel around a bit. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. I’m listening now…and gently pressing…any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of pressure, but no pain. It feels…normal, I guess. It’s been a while since anyone’s poked around in there, so it’s a little strange, but not uncomfortable. It feels like…well, a doctor checking, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No obvious tenderness. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and a little bit of sensation in your legs and feet. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing. Okay…reflexes are a little diminished, which isn't uncommon at your age, but everything seems otherwise intact.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s good to hear. My legs have always felt a little…slow, if you know what I mean. Not painful, just…not as quick as they used to be. I figured it was just getting older. Everything feels…normal, though. I’m not feeling any tingling or numbness or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with some difficulty with complete bladder emptying, possibly with a weakened stream. While it could be a number of things, the history of similar issues in your wife and the gradual onset of symptoms raises some concerns. I'd like to order a urinalysis to rule out infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it. And just to be thorough, I’m going to order a PSA test, a blood test to screen for prostate issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially with…well, everything. So, yes, please go ahead with those tests. How will I…do them? Will I have to come back, or…?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. The urinalysis is simple, you'll just need to provide a urine sample when you come to the lab. For the post-void residual volume, you'll empty your bladder as completely as you can, and then a technician will use a small ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining. It's painless. The PSA test is just a blood draw. The lab is right down the hall. I'll have the nurse give you the requisition forms. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them and decide on a plan. Depending on those results, we might need to consider a referral to a urologist. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds…manageable. So, I just go to the lab, give them a pee sample and some blood, and then you'll tell me what it means? That doesn't sound too bad. A urologist…is that someone who specializes in…down there?
DOCTOR: Exactly. A urologist specializes in the urinary system. We’ll see what the tests say first. We don't necessarily need to go straight to a specialist, but it's good to have the option if needed. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and answer any questions you might have about the tests. In the meantime, try to drink a normal amount of fluids and avoid anything that might irritate your bladder, like caffeine or alcohol. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not rush things. It’s…reassuring to talk to someone who understands. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or inability to urinate at all, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll just wait for the test results and take it from there. The nurse will be right with you. Have a good day.
