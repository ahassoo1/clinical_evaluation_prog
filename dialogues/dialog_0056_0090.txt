DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I believe this is a clearance visit? It feels a bit strange, if I’m honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I’m relying on… arrangements that were made.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative clearance visit. That makes sense. And you're right to say your memory isn’t what it used to be – no worries at all, we can take things slow and I’ll document everything carefully. I see here you’re scheduled for a… sleeve gastrectomy?
PATIENT: A… sleeve what, now? Oh dear. That sounds familiar… Was that to do with… losing weight? My husband, he… he helped me look into things. It was a while ago, and… well, everything is a bit blurry. I apologize. Is that a type of stomach surgery?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It is a type of stomach surgery, yes. A sleeve gastrectomy – sometimes called a gastric sleeve – removes a large portion of your stomach, which helps with weight loss. So, it sounds like this is something you’ve been considering for a while. Let’s just go through some things to make sure you're a good candidate and everything is safe to proceed. First, can you tell me a little bit about why you’re interested in this surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it was mostly for my health, I think. I’ve always struggled with my weight, and it… it started to cause problems. My husband was very concerned. He was a very practical man, and he wanted me to be able to… to live a longer, healthier life. I felt… sluggish, and I wasn’t able to do things I enjoyed. It’s difficult to explain… it wasn’t just about how I looked, it was about feeling well. He… he’s no longer with me, and I hadn’t really thought about it much until now. I suppose… he would want me to go through with it if it was possible.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Mackenzi. It sounds like he was a very supportive person, and it's understandable that you're considering this with his wishes in mind. Okay, so it sounds like weight loss and improved health are the main goals. Can you tell me a bit more about the health problems you were experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… I remember getting out of breath easily. Even just walking up the stairs was… a struggle. And my knees… they hurt terribly. I think the doctor – our family doctor – mentioned something about my blood pressure being high. And… I often felt tired, even after a full night’s sleep. It was… a general feeling of unwellness, if that makes sense. I wasn’t really diagnosed with anything specific, just… told to lose weight. It was very frustrating. I tried dieting, of course, but… it never seemed to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath, knee pain, and high blood pressure. And you’ve tried dieting without much success. That makes sense. Do you know what your current weight and height are, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… another thing I’m not quite sure about. I haven’t weighed myself in quite some time. I’m… short, I think. Around five foot two, perhaps? And… I’d guess… around ninety kilograms? It could be more, honestly. I really wouldn’t know for certain. I apologize again for being so vague. My mind just isn’t cooperating today.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Mackenzi. We can get accurate measurements here, so don't worry about it. Let's start with that, and then we’ll check your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. As far as I know, I don’t have any allergies. I’ve never reacted badly to anything, thankfully. And… no medical conditions, not that I’m aware of. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. Oh… I do take a mild blood pressure medication, now. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Is that right? I’m terrible with names, even for medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure. Good to know. And you said you’ve never had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. And… I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course. But no major surgeries, no… nothing like that. I remember being quite healthy for most of my life, actually. It was only in the last few years that things started to… decline. It all happened rather quickly, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and otherwise generally healthy until recently. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my family. Well, I have a sister, she lives in Bogotá. We don’t see each other very often, unfortunately. She’s… healthy, as far as I know. My parents… they both passed away some time ago. Heart problems, I believe. And… my husband, of course. He… he had diabetes, and… complications. It was very sudden. I don’t know much about their medical histories, to be honest. We didn’t talk about those things much. It was… a difficult topic.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your losses, Mackenzi. That’s a lot to go through. Okay, so a sister who is healthy, and your parents and husband both passed away from heart problems and diabetes, respectively. Just so I have a clear picture. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And… I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I always thought it was… unhealthy. My husband felt the same way. We preferred to drink juice, or water. And… we tried to eat a healthy diet, but… it was difficult. Especially towards the end.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I sometimes feel… anxious. Especially when I’m thinking about the surgery. It’s just… a lot to take in. And… I get very tired easily, even after a full night’s sleep. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, to be honest. And… I suppose I should mention that I’m widowed. It’s been… difficult adjusting to life on my own. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Mackenzi. It's helpful for me to understand everything that's going on in your life. It's completely normal to feel anxious before a surgery, and adjusting to life after losing your husband must be incredibly difficult. We can certainly discuss resources to help with both of those things. Okay, so anxiety and fatigue, and adjusting to widowhood. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, and to get a sense of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not alarmingly so, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit, right… here. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It often feels like… a fullness, or a pressure. It’s worse after I eat, usually. And sometimes… I get a bit of nausea. It’s probably nothing, though. I get indigestion sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the upper right quadrant of your abdomen, and fullness or pressure after eating, with occasional nausea. Pulse is 82, reflexes are normal. Overall, everything seems… stable, but the tenderness in your abdomen is something we need to investigate further. Given your history, the tenderness, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it would be best to order some blood work and an ultrasound of your abdomen. The blood work will give us a better picture of your liver function, and the ultrasound will help us see if there’s anything going on with your gallbladder or other organs in your abdomen. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment. I just want to be sure everything is… alright. What… what are you looking for, exactly? Is it something serious? I apologize for being so… inquisitive.
DOCTOR: No, please don't apologize at all. It's perfectly reasonable to ask questions. We’re looking to rule out any issues with your gallbladder, like gallstones, or any problems with your liver. The tenderness in your abdomen, combined with your history, just makes it prudent to investigate. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's better to be safe. We’ll get the orders sent to the lab and the radiology department. They’ll contact you to schedule the tests. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some resources that might be helpful for dealing with anxiety and grief. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. That would be… wonderful. I’ve been feeling rather overwhelmed lately, and… a little lost. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I suppose I haven't really allowed myself to… grieve properly. It's been difficult. Thank you. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. There are several local support groups for widows, and I can also provide you with some information on therapists who specialize in grief counseling. We also have a patient navigator who can help you with scheduling appointments and navigating the healthcare system. Would you like me to connect you with her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… incredibly helpful. I always get so confused with paperwork and… everything. A patient navigator sounds perfect. And… the support groups and therapists as well, if you wouldn’t mind. I suppose I should start taking care of myself, for once. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I'll have the patient navigator reach out to you within the next 24 hours. They’ll also send you the information on the support groups and therapists. So, to summarise, we’ve ordered blood work and an ultrasound of your abdomen to investigate the tenderness. We’ve also arranged for a patient navigator to help you with scheduling and resources. And we’re connecting you with support groups and therapists for grief counseling. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and… I feel much better knowing there’s a plan. I appreciate your kindness and patience. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll wait to hear from the patient navigator, then. And… I’ll try to be patient. It’s not always easy. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We're here to help. Take care, Mackenzi. And please remember, it's okay to ask for help.
