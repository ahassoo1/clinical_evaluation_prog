DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, my back. It’s been painful. I would like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course. Back pain is…common. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of it. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s…sharp. Mostly lower back. Feels like…something is stuck. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month. Hard to say exactly. It gets worse when I bend over, like when I’m fixing fence. Which is…my job. I erect fences.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sharp pain, lower back, started around a month ago… and it's definitely worse with bending, especially with your work. Fixing fence… that sounds physically demanding. Does the pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes. It goes down my left leg, sometimes. Not always. More like…a dull ache there when the back pain is really bad. Not a sharp pain like in my back, though. It's…difficult to explain. It's just…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable is a good way to put it. And the ache goes down your left leg… I see. Does anything make the pain better?
PATIENT: Sitting, sometimes. Or…lying flat. Not moving is best, truthfully. But…I have a job to do. And sitting all day isn't an option. A hot bath helps a little, but not for long. It’s…temporary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sitting or lying flat offers some relief, and a hot bath provides temporary comfort. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. No tingling. Just the ache, like I said, when my back is particularly bad. And…sometimes it feels stiff. Very stiff. Hard to move in the mornings. I have to…work it loose. It's…not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Stiffness, especially in the mornings… Okay. Now, have you experienced any issues with your bladder or bowel?
PATIENT: Issues? What do you mean? No…not that I'm aware of. Everything is…normal. I haven't noticed anything different there. It's just…my back hurts. I'm not sure what that has to do with…that. It seems like a strange question.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it. It is a bit of a strange question, but it's important to rule out anything serious. Sometimes back problems can affect those nerves, so I just need to ask. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medicare is my insurance. I’m widowed, if that matters. Otherwise…no, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I’ve always been…relatively healthy. Until now. My husband…he took care of most of the doctor visits. I’m not used to this.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a spouse is difficult enough, without having to navigate medical appointments as well. Medicare is good to have, and that's helpful. And it sounds like you've been quite healthy up until this back pain. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I avoided them, if I could. Always preferred to…tough it out. My husband…he wasn't a fan of doctors either. It’s…just how we were raised. Practical people. Didn't believe in unnecessary procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And that’s perfectly understandable. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. I don't take pills. Never have. I’m…not one for medication. I prefer to deal with things naturally, if possible. Or…ignore them, truthfully. Until they become unbearable. Which is…where I’m at now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. Never had a reaction to anything. I…I don’t think I’ve ever even had a rash. It's…remarkable, really. I’m usually very…resilient. This back pain is…unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No allergies, no medications… Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds…fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have fences to fix. But…yes. Go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just…be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as efficient as possible. Please lie down on the table, on your back. Okay, just relax. I’m going to gently press here... any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there. That’s…sharp. Not constant, but…when you press. And…when I bend over, like you're asking me to do. It’s…difficult to explain. It’s not a dull ache, it's a…stabbing pain. Like something is…caught. It makes me…wince.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to lift your leg straight up in the air. Just let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. This is to check for nerve involvement. How about that leg?
PATIENT: Yes. That one. The left one. Not a bad pain, but…a stretching feeling. Down the back of my leg. It's…uncomfortable. It’s not the sharp pain in my back, but…I can feel it. Down to my foot, a little. It's…hard to describe. It's just…a pulling sensation. It's…not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how about that leg?
PATIENT: No pain there. Not at all. That one feels…normal. Like it should. It’s just…the left one. That’s where the problem is. Everything on the right feels…fine. Perfectly fine. It’s…frustrating. One leg is fine, the other one isn't. It’s…not logical.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain with possible radiculopathy, meaning the pain is radiating down your leg due to some irritation of the nerve. The straight leg raise test was positive on the left side, which supports that. I don't suspect anything serious at this point, but we should get an X-ray to rule out any fractures or other structural issues. Do you agree?
PATIENT: X-ray? Yes. If that's what you think is necessary. I don’t like being fussed over, but…if it will get this sorted faster, then yes. An X-ray is…fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And…will it tell me what’s wrong? Will it show me what’s caught? Because that’s what it feels like. Something is…caught. And needs to be…uncaught.
DOCTOR: The X-ray will help us visualize the bones in your lower back and rule out any fractures or abnormalities. It won’t show the nerves themselves, or what’s causing the irritation, but it’s a good first step. If the X-ray is normal, we may consider an MRI to get a more detailed look at the soft tissues, like the discs and nerves. As for what's causing the “caught” sensation, it could be a muscle spasm, a bulging disc pressing on a nerve, or inflammation. We need to gather more information. For now, I'm going to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine. I’ll also prescribe a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to help manage the pain and spasm. And I recommend taking it easy, avoiding heavy lifting, and using heat or ice packs to your lower back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds…reasonable. Muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… I suppose that's better than nothing. Heat or ice… I can manage that. Avoiding heavy lifting… difficult, but I will try. As long as this doesn't take too long to sort out. I have fences to fix. And…will the pills make me sleepy? I need to be able to…function.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, but it varies from person to person. I’m prescribing a low dose, and you can always start with half a pill to see how you react. If it makes you too sleepy, you can reduce the dosage or take it only at bedtime. The anti-inflammatory shouldn't cause significant drowsiness. I’ll have the nurse send the prescriptions to your pharmacy. She’ll also give you some instructions on how to care for your back. I want to see you back in two weeks to see how you’re doing and review the X-ray results. If your pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Just…hopefully these pills work. And hopefully, I can get back to fixing fences soon. I…appreciate your help, Doctor. Now…where is the nurse? I would like to get this sorted and get on my way.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside the door. She will get you set up with the prescriptions and answer any further questions you may have. She'll be right in. Get well soon, Ms. Reihner. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
