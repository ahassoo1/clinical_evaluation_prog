DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? I’m not entirely certain. My husband insisted. Something about… establishing care. New to the area, you see. It’s all rather bothersome, frankly. I haven't been sick a day in my life.
DOCTOR: Establishing care is prudent, regardless of current health status. It allows us to monitor things and catch any potential issues early. Very well. Let’s start with a bit of history. You said you're new to the area… how long have you been here?
PATIENT: Oh, a few months, perhaps? It all blurs together, you know. We moved from… somewhere warmer. Florida, I believe. Though I can’t recall precisely when. It’s the heat I miss, mostly. Not this…dampness. And all the young people. Honestly, it’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Florida. Alright. And before Florida, where were you living?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… a very long time ago. Before your time, I'm sure. My husband handles all those details. I believe it was… California? No, wait… Texas? It doesn't matter, does it? I’m here now, aren't I? I simply don’t have the energy for endless recollections.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Engelhaupt. Knowing your past medical history is vital. Do you recall anything about previous illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations? Good heavens, no. I've always taken excellent care of myself. A bit of a cold now and then, naturally. But nothing serious. Surgeries… perhaps a tonsillectomy as a child? Though honestly, my memory is…fickle. My husband says I had a minor procedure on my hand, decades ago, but I find that rather unlikely. He exaggerates, you know. It's probably just a spot.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take… a little something for my water retention, I suppose. A small, white pill. My husband orders it for me. And occasionally, a digestive biscuit before bed. Does that count? Honestly, it’s all rather fussy. I prefer natural remedies, really. A nice cup of chamomile tea does wonders. I don’t like filling myself with chemicals.
DOCTOR: Do you know the name of this medication for water retention?
PATIENT: Heavens, no. Names are so… unnecessary. It comes in a little bottle. White, as I said. My husband handles all of that. He gets it from… the drugstore, naturally. Really, I haven't the faintest idea. Why must you inquire about every single detail? It’s rather…invasive, don’t you think? I simply take the pill when my ankles swell. It's not a complicated matter.
DOCTOR: Knowing the medication is crucial, Ms. Engelhaupt. It allows us to avoid potential interactions and ensure you’re receiving appropriate care. Alright. Let’s try this. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really. I’ve always been a very… robust individual. A bit of a sniffle in the spring, perhaps. But allergies? No. I’ve never been plagued with such nonsense. My husband insists I avoid shellfish, but I suspect that's simply because he dislikes the smell. He’s rather particular about odors, you see. .
