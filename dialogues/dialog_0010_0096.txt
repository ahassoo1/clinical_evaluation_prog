DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's a bit hard to explain, but I've been really bothered by the sun lately. Anything bright, really. It's like my eyes are super sensitive, even on cloudy days. It started a few months ago, I think, maybe around March?
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light, starting around March. That’s helpful. When you say “bothered,” can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not exactly pain, Doctor. More like… everything’s just too bright. It makes my eyes water and it feels like there's pressure behind them, like a headache starting. Sometimes it's hard to see clearly, everything gets washed out. And it makes me squint a lot, which then does give me a headache. It’s just… uncomfortable, really. Really uncomfortable. It’s making it hard to get things done, you know? Even reading is becoming a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, increased watering, pressure behind the eyes, some blurred vision, and headaches related to squinting, all triggered by bright light. And it’s impacting your daily activities, like reading. Is this sensitivity constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Some days it's barely noticeable, even with the sun shining. Other days… like today, even being in here feels a bit too bright. It seems worse when I've been outside for a while, and then come inside. Or if I'm looking at a computer screen for too long. It’s hard to predict, honestly. I haven’t really noticed any pattern, just… random.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, triggered by sun exposure and screen time. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hmm. I have been feeling a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. And my eyes feel dry sometimes, even when they're watering. Not always, but… yeah, dry and tired. Oh, and I've noticed a few floaters, those little spots that drift around in your vision? I’ve always had a couple, but they seem more frequent now. I don't know if that's connected, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, dry eyes and watering, and increased floaters. That's good information. Now, let's go through some other things. Have you had any changes in your vision – blurry vision that doesn't improve with blinking, double vision, or loss of peripheral vision?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. My vision seems… normal when it's not being bothered by the light. I can see things clearly enough, close up and far away. No blurriness that stays, no double vision, nothing like that. It really just feels like the light is too much, and then my eyes react. Like they're trying to protect themselves. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. You're describing a sensitivity to bright light with accompanying symptoms like watering and pressure. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I was married, but my wife passed away a few years back. Aside from that… I don’t really have any medical conditions, Doctor. I’ve always been pretty healthy. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And, like I mentioned earlier, I'm covered by Medicare. I think that's everything. I’ve never really had to see a doctor much before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm sorry to hear about your wife. And that’s good to know about your general health. No chronic conditions, just a multivitamin occasionally. Have you ever had any eye injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I haven’t had any injuries to my eyes, and I’ve never had any surgery on them or anything. I wear glasses, but I’ve had them for years and the prescription hasn’t changed much. Just regular check-ups with the optician, you know? Nothing serious. My wife always took care of making those appointments. It’s…different now. But no, no surgeries or injuries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no eye surgeries or injuries. And you’ve been wearing glasses with a stable prescription for some time. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have any eye conditions, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had cataracts when she got older, I think. She had surgery for them, and it seemed to help her a lot. My father… I don’t really remember him having any eye problems. He passed away when I was young. And I don’t know much about my wife’s family, honestly. We didn’t talk about their medical history much. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I don’t really know much about family eye problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had cataracts, which is helpful to know. And it’s alright, not everyone has detailed family medical history. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick eye exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked. Never even tried it. My wife didn't smoke either. We both believed in staying healthy. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. No other habits that I think would be relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine. Good. Now, let’s do a quick examination of your eyes. I’m going to check your visual acuity, your eye movements, and look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won't be painful, just a little bright light. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. A little bright light doesn’t bother me too much, I suppose. As long as it’s not too bright! I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please cover your left eye with your hand. And tell me what you see on this chart. Start with the top line, if you can read it.
PATIENT: Okay, covering my left eye… um… let’s see… E… F… P… T… O… Yes, I can read those. Pretty clearly, I think.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, uncover your left eye and cover your right eye. What do you see on the chart now?
PATIENT: Okay, covering my right eye… hmm… E… F… P… T… O… Yes, I can read those just the same. They look the same to me. I think my vision is pretty good, actually. It's just the brightness that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your visual acuity seems to be 20/20 in both eyes. Now, I'm going to shine this light in your eyes briefly to check your pupillary response and make sure your eyes are tracking properly. Just follow the light with your eyes. Do you feel any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No pain or discomfort, Doctor. Just a little bright, but that doesn’t bother me too much. I’m following the light… up and down… left and right… It feels a bit strange, but not painful. I hope I’m doing it right.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Everything seems to be tracking normally. Now, I'm going to look at the back of your eyes with this instrument. It will be another bright light, but it will only take a moment. Okay. I see some mild optic disc edema in both eyes, which means there's a little bit of swelling of the optic nerve. The retinal vessels appear normal, and I don't see any major hemorrhages or exudates. I also noted some mild drusen, which are small deposits under the retina, but these are common with age and don’t usually cause any problems. Your macula looks clear.
PATIENT: Optic disc… edema? That sounds… serious. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something I should be worried about? And drusen… is that the same thing as cataracts? I'm a bit worried now, I have to admit. It's just… everything's been a bit unsettling lately, you know? The light sensitivity, and now this… swelling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Komarov. Optic disc edema is swelling of the optic nerve, and it can be a sign of several different conditions. However, it's often mild and doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. In your case, it's relatively mild, and there are no other immediate concerns. Drusen are small deposits under the retina, and they are very common as we age. They're not the same thing as cataracts; cataracts are clouding of the lens. Given your symptoms of light sensitivity and the mild optic disc edema, my initial thought is that you may be experiencing a form of optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. It can cause pain, vision loss, and light sensitivity. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as increased intracranial pressure. To do that, I'd like to order a few tests: a visual evoked potential test to assess the function of your optic nerve, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… optic neuritis… MRI… VEP… That’s a lot of big words, Doctor. And a lot of tests. But… yes, I’m comfortable with that. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I just want to know what’s causing this, and what can be done about it. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Not knowing. So, whatever tests you think are best, let’s do them. And… can you explain a little bit more about what these tests involve? Just so I know what to expect?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Komarov. It’s completely understandable to want to know what to expect. The visual evoked potential, or VEP, test is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity in your brain in response to visual stimulation. You’ll sit in front of a screen, and they’ll show you different patterns, and sensors will be placed on your scalp to record the electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all, and usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, scan uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You’ll lie inside a large tube, and it’s important to remain very still during the scan. We’ll ask you to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or watches, before the scan. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, but we can give you a sedative if you're feeling anxious. The scan usually takes about 30-60 minutes. I’ll write the orders for these tests now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule them. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as vision loss, double vision, or severe headache, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about these tests, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds manageable. Not pleasant, maybe, but manageable. The MRI sounds a bit scary, but I can try to stay calm. And I'll definitely let you know if things get worse. Just one question, Doctor. You mentioned treatment. What kind of treatment are we talking about, if it is optic neuritis? Is it something I can take pills for? Or is it more serious than that? I'm trying not to panic, but… it's hard, you know? This is all new to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Komarov. It’s completely natural to be worried. If it is optic neuritis, the treatment usually involves a course of high-dose intravenous steroids, which are administered through a vein. This helps to reduce the inflammation and speed up recovery. We would typically administer these steroids for several days in the hospital. In most cases, this treatment is very effective, and people experience significant improvement in their symptoms. However, it's important to remember that optic neuritis can sometimes recur, so we would need to monitor you closely after treatment. In rare cases, optic neuritis can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as multiple sclerosis. If the tests suggest this, we would refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation and management. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to get the test results first. I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and get you on the road to recovery. Do you have any other questions, or would you like me to repeat anything?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, Doctor. Steroids… and maybe a neurologist if it's something more serious. I'll try not to worry about that part just yet. I'll focus on the tests for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and you've made me feel a lot less anxious. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I think that's all for now. Just let me know when the radiology department contacts me to schedule the tests. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the test results. Have a good day, and take care.
