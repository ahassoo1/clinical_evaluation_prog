DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…fine. Though frankly, I expected a nicer office for a specialist. But never mind that. I’m here about this…patch on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, it’s not getting any better, is it?
DOCTOR: I apologize that the office does not meet your expectations, Ms. Bartock. We are continually working to improve our facilities. However, your health is my primary concern. You mentioned a patch on your skin that is bothersome and not improving. Could you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it started…oh, let me think…sometime in the spring, I believe. It’s on my left forearm, just below the elbow. It's…discolored. Not a nice color, really. A sort of…muddy brown. And it’s slightly raised. Not terribly, but enough to notice. I’ve tried some creams – over-the-counter things, you understand, I don’t go rushing to doctors for everything – and they haven’t done a thing. It just…is there. It’s also a little itchy sometimes, though I wouldn’t say it’s terribly uncomfortable. More…annoying.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Bartock. "Muddy brown," slightly raised, located on your left forearm below the elbow, and present since the spring. You’ve tried over-the-counter creams without success, and it’s occasionally itchy, mostly annoying. To help me understand this better, could you describe the initial appearance of the patch?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it didn’t start as…muddy brown, you understand. It was more…a faint pinkish patch, really. Very small. I thought it was just a little irritation, perhaps from gardening. I do enjoy my roses, you see. It wasn’t painful or anything, just…there. Over the weeks, it gradually darkened and, well, became this. And it hasn’t gotten smaller, obviously. I don't come to doctors for things to worsen, do I?
DOCTOR: “Faint pinkish patch” initially, resembling irritation, gradually darkening over weeks to its current state. That's very helpful, Ms. Bartock. Now, have you noticed any changes in the patch recently?
PATIENT: Well…now that you mention it, it seems a tiny bit…rougher. Not dramatically, you understand. But the skin around it feels…not as smooth as it used to. And I think – though I could be imagining things – it's ever so slightly bigger. Perhaps the size of a…a small coin now? It was truly minuscule when it began. I really don't understand why simple things take so long.
DOCTOR: “Rougher” texture and a possible slight increase in size, now approximately the size of a small coin. Thank you for pointing that out. Ms. Bartock, to get a clearer picture, would you mind if I take a closer look at the patch?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. Yes, please do. I've been describing it for quite some time now. Honestly, I expected you to be examining it immediately. It's not as if I'm presenting with something…contagious, is it? Though I do wash my hands, naturally. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. It’s important to thoroughly assess any skin changes. And no, I don’t believe it is contagious, but a careful examination is always necessary. Alright. I'm noting a roughly bordered, hyperpigmented macule, approximately 1 centimeter in diameter, located on your left forearm. There is slight scaling present, and the surrounding skin feels mildly dry. No significant induration or warmth. There’s no palpable lymphadenopathy. Now, have you had any similar patches anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Oh, good. You’re finally doing something. Yes, well…actually, there was one. A very small one, on my right hand, on the back. It appeared around the same time as this one, but…it faded. Just…went away on its own. I didn’t think much of it, honestly. It was tiny, and it resolved. This one, though, is quite persistent. And as I’ve mentioned repeatedly, it's not getting any better. I don’t understand why things always take so long. Perhaps it’s because I'm married to a lawyer. Everything is slow with lawyers.
DOCTOR: “Similar patch on the right hand that resolved spontaneously.” Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Bartock. That’s helpful information. Given the persistence of this lesion, and the previous patch on your hand, I'd like to perform a simple skin scraping to rule out any fungal infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A…scraping? Oh, goodness. Must you? Will it…hurt? Honestly, I don’t see the point. It’s clearly not fungal. I’ve dealt with fungal infections before – my garden, you understand – and this is entirely different. But if you must, I suppose. Just…be gentle. And quick. I have a lunch appointment, you see. And my husband…well, he dislikes being kept waiting. He’s a very important lawyer.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick and generally painless procedure, Ms. Bartock. We’ll simply collect a small sample of skin cells to examine under a microscope. It will help us rule out common causes and ensure we're taking the best course of action. It should only take a few moments. Alright, all done. It’s a very small sample, and I'll apply a small bandage. We’ll send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a few business days. While we're waiting for the results, I also want to ask you about your medical history. Have you had any other skin conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Fine. Though I still maintain it’s entirely unnecessary. As for medical history…well, I’ve always had rather sensitive skin, prone to dryness. And a touch of eczema as a child, but that cleared up years ago. Nothing serious, you understand. My husband always says I worry too much about my health. He’s a very logical man, that one. Very practical. We have excellent insurance, you see - Medicare - so I’m careful to get things checked, naturally. Though I do wish doctors would trust my own judgment more often. I know my body best, after all.
DOCTOR: “Sensitive skin” and “childhood eczema,” now resolved. That’s helpful information, Ms. Bartock. It’s good you are proactive about your health. Now, have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently, such as fatigue, weight loss, or fever?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Perfectly fine, as far as I'm concerned. Perhaps a little tired, everyone is a little tired, aren't they? But nothing alarming. I do enjoy my garden, you see. It's rather strenuous work, though I don't complain. My husband says I need more exercise, but honestly, the gardening is quite sufficient. I do make sure to wear a hat, naturally - one must protect one’s complexion, after all. And I haven’t lost any weight, thankfully. I rather enjoy my meals. No fever, either. I’ve been perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. This patch is just…an annoyance. A bothersome annoyance that seems to be taking forever to resolve.
DOCTOR: “No fatigue, weight loss, or fever.” That’s good to know, Ms. Bartock. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I prefer a natural approach, as much as possible. Though I do take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side. And a little calcium, for my bones. My husband insists. He worries about osteoporosis, you see. But that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, naturally. I don’t go rushing for pills at the slightest ailment, do I? I believe in strengthening my body naturally, through a healthy diet and plenty of sunshine. And, of course, a good moisturizer. My complexion is very important to me.
DOCTOR: “Multivitamin and calcium supplements.” Thank you. Ms. Bartock, while we await the results of the skin scraping, I would like to discuss some potential causes for this lesion. It could be a number of things, including a benign growth, a mild form of dermatitis, or, less commonly, a precancerous lesion. It is important to rule out all possibilities to ensure we provide you with the best care. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Precancerous? Now you’re frightening me! I told you it was nothing serious! It’s just a little patch, and frankly, I’m starting to feel quite unwell just thinking about it. A precancerous lesion… honestly. My husband is going to be furious if I return home upset. He says I worry too much. Perhaps you shouldn't have mentioned that. I really don’t understand why you can't just give me something for it. Some cream, perhaps? Something to make it go away? This is entirely unnecessary stress.
DOCTOR: I apologize for causing you any distress, Ms. Bartock. I mentioned the possibility of a precancerous lesion only to be thorough and ensure we explore all options. It is unlikely to be serious, but it is always best to be cautious. To reiterate, we are currently awaiting the results of the skin scraping to determine the exact cause. In the meantime, to alleviate your anxiety, I can prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce any inflammation and itching. However, it's important to understand that this won't address the underlying cause, and we'll need the lab results to formulate a definitive treatment plan. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, a cream…yes, that would be something, at least. Just to calm it down, you understand. Honestly, I’m a nervous wreck now. My husband is going to be terribly upset if I return home agitated. He says I’m too sensitive. A cream…yes, please. Something mild, though. I don’t want any side effects. I have very delicate skin, you see. And could you perhaps write a note explaining everything to my husband? He’s a lawyer, and he likes to have all the details. He’ll want to know the dosage, the potential side effects, and everything else. Honestly, this has been quite a stressful appointment. I really don't understand why things take so long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I'll prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream, triamcinolone 0.1%, to be applied thinly to the affected area twice daily for two weeks. It’s generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects are minimal and can include mild irritation or thinning of the skin with prolonged use. I’m also preparing a detailed note for your husband outlining the findings, the prescribed medication, and potential side effects, as requested. The lab results should be available within five to seven business days. Once we receive them, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as significant pain, bleeding, or rapid growth, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Though frankly, I wish we hadn't mentioned the possibility of…that. Honestly, it's put me in a terrible state. I suppose I'll just have to wait and see. And I’ll be sure to apply the cream as directed. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, this has been a most unsettling appointment. And really, it all took so long! I do hope the results are negative. My husband will be furious if I return home upset. He’s a very practical man, you see. Very logical. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concerns, and I hope the results are reassuring. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
