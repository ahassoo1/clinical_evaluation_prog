DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola. Welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Havird. It’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up something awful. Mostly just one of ‘em, the left one. Started a few days ago, maybe four, five days now? It just… got bigger and bigger. It’s not painful painful, just… uncomfortable. Like wearing a shoe that’s a size too small, even when I’m not wearin’ one.
DOCTOR: Four or five days, alright. And just the left foot?
PATIENT: Yep, just the left. Right one’s fine, thank you goodness. It started kinda slow, I thought maybe I just bumped it on somethin’, you know? But it hasn’t gone down. I tried elevatin’ it a bit, put some ice on it, but didn’t seem to do much. It feels… warm too, if that makes sense. Not fever warm, but warmer than my other foot, definitely.
DOCTOR: Warm… alright. And have you noticed any changes in the skin?
PATIENT: Changes in the skin? Hmm… let me think. It’s… a little redder, maybe? Not bright red, but not the normal color, you know? It’s kinda shiny too, I guess. I hadn't really paid much attention ‘til you asked, to be honest. Usually just try to ignore it and hope it goes away. Does shiny mean somethin’ bad? I’m not good with all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Shiny… okay. Redness and warmth can mean a few things. We’ll need to take a look. I'm going to examine your foot, if that's alright with you. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please do, Doctor. That’s why I came, right? I'm not a fan of doctors, never have been, but I figured I should get it checked out. Just… be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. It doesn’t hurt hurt, like I said, but I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling around now… there’s definitely some swelling here, and some warmth as you mentioned. And yes, I can see the redness. No obvious signs of injury… let me check your pulses. Dorsalis pedis is present, a little weak but there. Posterior tibial is the same. It's good that we're getting a pulse, but it’s not as strong as it should be.
PATIENT: Weak pulse, huh? Is that bad? I try to walk a lot, I like gettin’ out and about when the weather’s nice. Could that be somethin’? Or maybe… I was workin’ on my little garden yesterday, bent over for a long time. Could that have somethin’ to do with it? I don't know much about all this pulse stuff, I’m just tryin’ to figure it out. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? I got bills to pay, you know? Can't be laid up for weeks.
DOCTOR: It's good you're active, that's generally healthy. Gardening... bending over for a long time could contribute, but the weak pulse is concerning. It suggests there might be some reduced blood flow to your foot. We need to figure out why that is. It could be a number of things, from a simple blockage to something more… involved. Now, have you ever had any issues with circulation?
PATIENT: Circulation? Not that I know of. Never been told anything like that, not by a doctor anyway. My legs get a little tired sometimes when I walk a long ways, but I figured that’s just ‘cause I’m not as young as I used to be. And it gets hot in the city, you know? Maybe that makes ‘em swell a little. I’ve never had a proper diagnosis or anything. Never had any blood clots or nothin’ like that. I don’t even know what a blood clot feels like. Is that what you’re thinkin’ about?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily a blood clot, but it's something we need to rule out. Given the swelling, redness, warmth, and the weakened pulse, we should get some imaging done. An ultrasound of your leg would be the best first step to look at the blood flow. And I want to order some blood work to check for inflammation and other potential issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound and blood work… That sounds… complicated. And probably expensive, right? I don't have insurance, Doctor. I've been meanin’ to get some, but… it just never seems to work out. I can pay somethin’, but I don’t have a lot. How much are we talkin’ about? I need to know if I can afford it before we go any further. I appreciate you lookin’ at it, but I can’t get myself into debt over this foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. Unfortunately, I don't have exact figures for the pricing. It depends on the facility, and the specific tests ordered. However, given your lack of insurance, I can connect you with the hospital’s financial assistance department. They may be able to offer a discount or payment plan. I can also see if there are any free or low-cost clinics in the area that offer ultrasound services. Let me write that down for you. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. To be on the safe side, and given your symptoms, I’m going to prescribe you a blood thinner to start, just as a preventative measure. It won't solve the problem, but it can help reduce the risk of complications. We still need to figure out the cause of the swelling, but this will give us some peace of mind while we do. Sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A blood thinner… That sounds… serious. Is that gonna make me bleed easier? I take a little bit of aspirin sometimes for headaches, but that’s it. I’m not a fan of takin’ pills, Doctor, to be honest. And I’m always a little worried about side effects. But… if it helps, and it gives you peace of mind, I guess I’m willing to try. I just hope it doesn’t cost a fortune. What’s the name of the pill? And what am I lookin’ out for? Like, what kind of side effects should I be worried about? I’m just tryin’ to be prepared.
DOCTOR: It’s called Warfarin. Yes, it does increase your risk of bleeding, that’s true. That’s why it’s important to follow the dosage instructions very carefully. You’ll need regular blood tests to monitor your levels and make sure you're not at risk. Common side effects are things like easy bruising, nosebleeds, or bleeding gums. If you experience any unusual or heavy bleeding, you need to seek medical attention immediately. I’m also going to give you a prescription for compression stockings. These will help improve blood flow and reduce the swelling. You need to wear them every day, especially when you’re walking. And I want you to elevate your foot whenever possible. It's important to be proactive about this, Mr. Parascondola. Following these instructions exactly is crucial for your well-being. Now, do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Warfarin, compression stockings… a lot to remember. Regular blood tests… that means more appointments, more money… But I guess I don’t have much choice, right? And what if… what if it doesn’t work? What if the swelling keeps getting worse, even with all this? Is there anything else I can do? Like, some kind of home remedy or somethin’? My grandmother used to have all sorts of tricks for everything. I just… I worry about losin’ my independence, Doctor. I like gettin’ out and walkin’. I don't wanna be stuck inside all the time.
DOCTOR: Home remedies are unlikely to be effective, Mr. Parascondola, and could potentially be harmful. We need to address the underlying cause of the swelling, and that requires medical intervention. As for the worst-case scenario, if the swelling persists despite treatment, we may need to consider further testing, such as a CT scan or venogram, to identify any blockages or abnormalities. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary. However, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll start with the Warfarin and compression stockings, monitor your progress, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It's important to stay positive and proactive. Now, do you have any questions about how to take the Warfarin or wear the compression stockings?
PATIENT: Positive… easy for you to say. But alright. The Warfarin… how often do I take it? And with food, or without? I don't want to mess it up. And the stockings… do they need to be tight? I don’t want to cut off my circulation even more! It all just seems so… complicated. And what about work? I drive a taxi, Doctor. Will this… Warfarin… affect my drivin’? I need to know if I can still work. That’s how I pay my bills.
DOCTOR: You take one pill every evening, with food. It helps with absorption. And yes, the stockings need to be snug, but not overly tight. They should feel supportive, but not restrictive. If your foot turns blue or feels numb, that means they're too tight. You’ll need to follow up with your primary care physician regularly to monitor your blood levels and adjust the dosage as needed. As for driving… Warfarin can affect your driving, yes. It increases your risk of bleeding, which could be dangerous in the event of an accident. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician and follow their recommendations. I've written down all the instructions on this sheet. Please read it carefully and follow them diligently. Do you have any other questions?
