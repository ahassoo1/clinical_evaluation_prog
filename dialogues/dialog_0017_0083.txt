DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or maybe just something… encouraging. My daughter, she thinks I need a little pick-me-up. It’s not a real sickness, you understand. Just… spirits low.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A card. Like… you write on it, you know? “Feel better soon” or something like that. My daughter, she says a word from the doctor would mean a lot. She worries too much, that one. But… it wouldn’t hurt, would it? A little something to show her I’m… being taken care of.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. I diagnose and treat medical conditions. I don’t… dispense motivational stationery. I have patients with genuine ailments waiting to be seen. Now, is there an actual medical reason you’ve come today, or am I wasting my time?
PATIENT: Well now, hold on just a minute! Wasting your time? I am a patient here, aren’t I? And I’m asking for a simple thing! It’s not like I’m asking for surgery! A little kindness doesn’t cost anything, Doctor. And it would make my daughter happy. She's been… well, she's just very thoughtful. It’s a small gesture, that's all. And frankly, it’s your job to care for your patients’ well-being, isn’t it? Even if that well-being isn’t… broken bones and fevers.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I assure you, I do care for my patients' well-being. However, that well-being is typically addressed through appropriate medical evaluation and intervention. Your request is… unusual, to say the least. It strikes me as a matter for a therapist, perhaps, or a family counselor. Are you experiencing any… underlying emotional distress that might be contributing to this desire for a physician-authored greeting card?
PATIENT: Emotional distress? Doctor, are you suggesting something is wrong with me? I’m perfectly fine! I just… like a little cheer now and then. Is that so hard to understand? My daughter thinks I’m feeling down because I’m… well, because I’m getting older, she says. But I’m a strong man! I’ve worked hard all my life, I’ve seen things. A little card from a doctor isn’t asking for the moon, Doctor. It's a little thing, and it would mean a lot to my girl. Honestly, you’re making me feel worse now by questioning my… my state of mind.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. I will document this visit as a request for "emotional support documentation." However, I must state for the record that there is no medical indication for such a document. I will write a brief note stating that you presented to the clinic today and expressed a desire for positive reinforcement. Is that… sufficient?
PATIENT: Positive reinforcement? Is that what we're calling it now? Look, Doctor, I don’t need fancy words. Just write something nice. “Mr. Kammer is doing well” or “Mr. Kammer is in good spirits”. Anything! Just… something my daughter can read and feel a little better about. I don’t want a document, I want a card! But if you have to call it a document… fine. Just make it say something… kind. And quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Here. “To Whom It May Concern: Mr. Early Kammer presented to the clinic today and reported subjective well-being. No acute medical concerns identified.” Is that… palatable enough?
PATIENT: “Subjective well-being”? What kind of language is that? And “To Whom It May Concern”? It doesn’t even say my daughter’s name! This is… this is ridiculous! You call yourself a doctor? Honestly, I've had better treatment from my mechanic. Never mind. Keep it. It’s… it’s not worth the trouble. I came here looking for a little kindness, and all I got was a lecture and a fancy piece of paper. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. Have a… satisfactory day. .
