DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get right to it. It’s this tiredness, this exhaustion. It’s getting worse, and frankly, it’s ridiculous. And… well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not by choice, mind you. It just… tastes good sometimes, and I can’t seem to stop. Don't look at me like that, it's not normal, I know that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. Thank you for being upfront with me. It's good that you're telling me everything that's going on, even if it feels… unusual. Let’s definitely figure out what’s causing this tiredness and address the… dirt consumption. To start, can you tell me a bit more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… everything feels like wading through mud. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. It’s not like I’m doing anything to be tired, you know? I don’t have a demanding job. Just helping out at the physical therapy place, mostly light stuff. But by lunchtime, I’m completely wiped. And it's been going on for... well, a few months now, steadily getting worse. I just thought I was getting old, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of progressively worsening fatigue, even with a relatively low level of activity. And you mentioned helping out at the physical therapy place – is that a regular commitment, and if so, how many hours a week?
PATIENT: Regular? Yes, I suppose. It’s not consistent, though. Old Mrs. Gable calls me in when she's short-staffed, which is usually three or four days a week. Each day is only about five or six hours, tops. Mostly just fetching things for the therapists, helping patients with their exercises, things like that. It’s not strenuous. Honestly, I’ve been doing it for years. This tiredness is new.
DOCTOR: Alright, so three to four days a week, five to six hours each day, light physical activity. And this fatigue is a recent development, despite years of doing the same work. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about this… dirt consumption. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t use that word. It sounds… awful. It started, oh, maybe two months ago? I was in the garden, weeding, and I just… tasted the soil. And it wasn’t unpleasant. Then I started craving it. It’s the red clay mostly, from around my azaleas. I know it's strange, and I try not to, but sometimes I just need a little bit. It sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's good you're being honest with me, and I appreciate you sharing this. It doesn't sound ridiculous to me; it's just unusual, and we need to understand why this is happening. It’s called pica, the craving and eating of non-nutritive substances. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings alongside this?
PATIENT: Pica? Well, that sounds fancy. No, just the dirt. Nothing else. I don’t go around eating chalk or paperclips, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just… the clay. Sometimes I add a little water to it, makes it easier to… go down. But honestly, it doesn’t feel like a craving, more like a… need. And I get a little… shaky if I don’t have some for a few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily the red clay, with a feeling of needing it rather than a typical craving, and some shakiness if you go without it for a few days. That's important information. Now, let’s take a step back and talk about your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where do I begin? My stomach’s been a bit… unsettled lately. Not full-blown sick, just… queasy. And I've been feeling colder than usual, even in the summer. My hands and feet are always chilly. Oh, and I’ve been a little… distracted. Forgetful, I suppose. Though, at my age, what isn't forgetful?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stomach upset, feeling cold, and some forgetfulness. Let's try to be a bit more specific. With the stomach upset, is it associated with any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Just… unsettled. Like a dull ache, mostly. And my bowel movements are… regular, I suppose. Nothing different there. Honestly, I've always had a sensitive stomach. And the forgetfulness… well, it’s not like I'm losing my mind, just misplacing things, forgetting names occasionally. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, so dull abdominal ache and some mild forgetfulness. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a hysterectomy, oh, must be forty years ago now. And I had my gallbladder removed, sometime in the nineties, I think. Other than that… not much. I used to get terrible migraines, but those stopped after menopause. I’ve been pretty healthy, actually, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy forty years ago, gallbladder removal in the nineties, and a history of migraines that have since resolved. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations besides those?
PATIENT: No, nothing else that I can recall. A few broken bones as a child, but that was a long time ago. Mostly just the usual doctor's visits, for check-ups and the occasional cold. I’m not a sickly person, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small dose. And I take a calcium supplement, because of my age. That's it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a calcium supplement. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything, take anything. I've never had a reaction to anything in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my… well, my mother had diabetes. And my father had heart trouble. My sister, bless her soul, she had high blood pressure, just like me. And… oh, my grandmother, she had some kind of anemia, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes, heart trouble, high blood pressure, and anemia in the family. And finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… well, decades. Not since my husband passed away. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I’m a churchgoing woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. And you mentioned your husband passing away. How long ago was that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… ten years now. Ten years this November. It was a shock, of course. He was a healthy man, always working in the garden. Just… a heart attack. Out of the blue. It’s still hard, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Hardenburgh. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, and abdomen, and also to take your blood pressure and check your iron levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, if you think it's necessary. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I have a luncheon to get to later, you see. And honestly, poking and prodding never feels very pleasant. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, let’s listen to your abdomen. Lastly, I’ll check your extremities for any swelling and assess your skin tone. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I'm concerned about a few things. The elevated blood pressure, the paleness, the cool extremities, the fatigue, and the… dirt consumption. It could be a number of things, including iron deficiency anemia, possibly related to the pica, or something else entirely. We need to do some blood work to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, anemia? That's what my grandmother had! But… blood work? I hate needles. Do you have to take a lot? And how long will it take to get the results? I really don’t want to be stuck here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Ms. Hardenburgh. We’ll only need a small sample of blood – just a few vials. It shouldn't take too long – maybe ten or fifteen minutes. The lab usually takes a couple of days to process the results, so I expect we’ll have them by the end of the week. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and figure out the best course of action. In the meantime, I want to address the pica. While it could be related to the anemia, we need to rule out other causes as well. I'm going to recommend that you try to stop eating the dirt. I know it's difficult, but it could be contributing to your symptoms. Do you think you can try that?
PATIENT: Oh, stopping? It's… difficult. Like a craving, almost. But alright, I'll try. No promises, mind you. But I will try. It's just… I feel better when I have it. A little stronger, a little more… alive. But if you think it’s bad, I’ll try to resist. And what about the blood work? Do I need to fast or anything? And where do I go to get it done?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being willing to try, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s good you recognize it might be contributing to your symptoms. Yes, you will need to fast for eight to twelve hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – just water is okay. We’ll give you a written instruction sheet with all the details. You can go to the lab at St. Luke’s Hospital – it’s just down the street. They’re open from 7 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. I’ll have my nurse give you a requisition form, and she’ll explain everything to you. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can call the office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fasting, St. Luke's… I can manage. Though I do enjoy my breakfast. But if it's necessary… I’ll go. And a follow-up appointment? How long will that be? I don't want to be stuck coming back here for weeks on end. Honestly, I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll schedule the follow-up appointment for as soon as the results are available - likely within a week, assuming no delays with the lab. It shouldn’t take long—just enough time to review the results and discuss the next steps. My nurse will go over everything with you before you leave—the fasting instructions, the location of the lab, and how to schedule the follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Honestly, I’m just ready to get this over with. Fasting, blood work, follow-up… it's all a bit much. But alright. Thank you… I suppose. Just… please tell your nurse to be quick with the instructions, alright? I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll let her know. And I hope you enjoy your luncheon. Thank you for coming in today, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: .
