DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s about… some paperwork I need to get sorted. A friend of mine is applying for… a visa, I believe, and they said I need to show proof of certain shots before it can go through. I'm not sure exactly which ones, and I thought it best to ask a professional. It’s a bit confusing, you see.
DOCTOR: A visa physical, right. Okay. Well, those can be… particular. Honestly, it's usually easier if the applicant knows exactly what the embassy requires. But we can certainly look into it. Do you have any documentation from the embassy or the visa application process listing the required vaccinations or tests?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t. My friend just… mentioned needing shots. He didn’t give me anything written down. He’s a bit… disorganized, bless his heart. He said something about a form, maybe? But I haven't seen it. I was hoping you could tell me what’s generally needed for someone applying for a visa. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: “Generally needed…” Right. Well, that’s… not ideal. It varies significantly depending on where he’s from, where he’s going, and what type of visa he’s applying for. We need more information than that, Mr. Skarbek. Do you know where he's applying from and where he intends to travel?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… hadn’t thought of that. He’s applying from… well, he’s been here in the States for quite a while, so I suppose from here. And he’s hoping to go back to visit family in… Honduras, I believe. It's been a long time since he talked about it, so I could be wrong about Honduras. It’s one of those Central American countries, anyway. Is that enough information? I feel terrible being so vague.
DOCTOR: Central America. That narrows it down… marginally. Honduras, okay. Look, Mr. Skarbek, with all due respect, this is a rather inefficient way to go about this. A visa physical requires specific documentation and adherence to embassy guidelines. We can proceed, but it's going to be significantly easier if he provides the exact requirements. Do you have any idea what kind of visa he’s applying for?
PATIENT: Well now, you’re right, it probably is a bit silly of me to be asking you to figure it all out. He didn’t say much about it, honestly. I think… he mentioned something about a tourist visa? But like I said, he doesn't explain things very well. He just said it was important I get my shots updated to help him with the paperwork. I apologize for the trouble, Doctor. Perhaps I should call him and get the specifics before we go any further? I wouldn't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: That would be… highly advisable, Mr. Skarbek. Save us both a great deal of unnecessary effort. Tourist visas, even within Central America, can have specific requirements, and we need to be precise. Do you have a phone you could use to give him a call now?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I do. Just a moment… let me see if I can find his number. It’s been a while since I called him, so I hope I still have it saved. Here we go… It’s Juan Rodriguez.
DOCTOR: Right. Get ahold of Mr. Rodriguez and get those specifics. I’ll be here, but I can't proceed effectively without knowing exactly what we're working with. I have other patients waiting, so I'm going to need a clear list of requirements before we can continue.
PATIENT: Ringing… ringing… Oh, hello? Juan? It's Karry Skarbek. Yes, it’s me. Listen, I'm at the doctor's office now, trying to get this paperwork sorted for your visa. They need to know exactly which shots you need… Yes, which ones. It's a bit complicated, apparently. Could you tell me what the embassy asked for? Please?
DOCTOR: Tourist visa… honestly, the inefficiency…
PATIENT: Uh-huh… yes… yes, I see… tetanus, measles… and something about a yellow fever vaccination? Okay, okay… and you said they needed a form filled out by a doctor, with my signature and the clinic stamp? Right. And it has to be a specific form… let me write this down… Okay, I think I've got it. Thank you, Juan. Yes, I’ll tell them everything. Alright, bye now. Well… that was a bit of a saga. He did have a form, and a list. It seems they need tetanus, measles, and a yellow fever vaccination. And he specifically said the form has to be signed and stamped by a doctor. He apologized for the confusion. Is that something you can help with, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yellow fever… right. Okay. That’s… better. We’ll need to review your vaccination history. Do you happen to have any records with you, or do we need to request them from your primary care physician?
PATIENT: I think… yes, here. It’s not much, sir. Mostly just records from when I was younger. My regular doctor retired a few years back, so I haven’t seen anyone regularly since then. I got a booster shot a while back, but I don’t remember exactly when or where. It was at a pharmacy, I think. Will this be enough?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Limited records. Okay. Let's start with a quick physical exam to assess your current status. I need to check your temperature, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. And we'll need to palpate for any signs of recent injection sites. It’s standard procedure, especially with a required vaccination. If you'll step over here, please.
PATIENT: Alright, sir. Whatever you need. I suppose it's a good thing to make sure everything is alright, anyway. It's been a while since I had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: If you'll just change into this gown, we can get started. I'll be right back with the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff.
PATIENT: Alright… here we go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 85. Not terrible, but could be better. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. No recent injection sites noted. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. I've never had any problems with medications, and I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My wife… bless her soul… she always kept track of those things. I haven't had much reason to take anything since she passed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam and your report of no allergies, you are a suitable candidate for the yellow fever vaccination. However, it’s important to be aware of potential side effects. Mild fever, headache, and muscle aches are common. Rare but serious side effects include allergic reactions and neurological complications. We’ll monitor you closely after the injection. Do you understand and consent to receiving the yellow fever vaccination?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I understand. And… yes, I consent. It's important to help my friend with his visa, and if this is what's needed, then I'll do it. I appreciate you explaining everything, even the… the bad parts. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. This may sting for a moment. There. All done. Monitor the injection site for any signs of excessive swelling or redness. If you experience a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention. I’ll document the vaccination in your chart, and provide a copy to you. Now, we will need to complete the visa form.
PATIENT: Ouch… that did sting a bit. Thank you, Doctor. Alright, I’ll keep an eye on it. And yes, the form… let’s get that done. I hope I can manage to fill this out correctly. It looks rather complicated.
DOCTOR: The form requires your personal information, a detailed travel history, and a signed attestation of your vaccination status. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. However, I have other patients waiting, so I'll need to keep this brief. Pay close attention to section three regarding your medical history. Be as accurate as possible.
PATIENT: Alright… section three… medical history… I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so I’m not sure what to put here. I… had the flu once, a long time ago. And my wife… she had high blood pressure. Does that need to be included? It's a bit confusing, sir. I’m not sure if I’m filling this out correctly.
DOCTOR: Your wife’s medical history is not relevant unless it has a direct impact on your own health. Focus on your own conditions. Did you ever have any serious illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No… not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a tree. But nothing serious, nothing that required a hospital stay. Just… minor things. Oh… wait. I had pneumonia once, when I was in the army. It was pretty bad, but I recovered fully. Does that need to be included?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia is relevant. List the year you were diagnosed and any complications you experienced. Once you've completed the form, sign and date it. I’ll stamp it and provide you with a copy for your records. Do you have any other questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think that's everything. Thank you for your help. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if you were… busy. I hope this is enough for my friend's visa. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. Here’s a copy of the vaccination record for your reference. If any complications arise, consult your primary care physician. Next patient.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
