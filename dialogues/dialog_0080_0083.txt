DOCTOR: Hi Early, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Rosanova, you say? A fine name. Well, to be frank, I ain’t really sick sick. More… low spirits, you understand? I just thought a little encouragement from a doctor… a card, maybe? Would do me some good. My ex-wife, she don’t send much these days. And a man needs… well, never you mind. It's just a little something to lift the mood, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Early. It’s good you came in. Feeling low can definitely impact your health, and it’s smart to address it. While I’m not able to prescribe a “mood-lifting card,” we can explore what's been going on and see if there’s a medical reason for how you're feeling. Sometimes low spirits are connected to things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even sleep problems. To start, can you tell me a little more about when these low spirits started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Thyroid… sounds complicated. And I sleep just fine, thank you very much. Six hours, regular as clockwork. Always have. Now, when did it start… that’s a question. It’s been a slow thing, you understand? Not like a cold you catch overnight. Probably since… well, since the divorce, to be honest. Three years ago, this August. She just… up and left. Said I was too quiet. Too much of a… a boiler man, I suppose. Not exciting enough. So, it's been a gradual thing. Getting a little worse each year. Not that I dwell on it.
DOCTOR: Three years ago, around the time of the divorce… that gives us a good starting point. And it’s been gradually worsening each year. I appreciate you sharing that, Early. It sounds like a significant life change, and it’s very common for difficult experiences to impact your mood. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it ain’t sadness, exactly. More… empty. Like a boiler with no water. Just… hollow. And tired. Not physically tired, mind you. I do my job, I keep the building warm. But… inside. Just… no pep. No interest in things. Used to enjoy a good baseball game on the radio. Now… not so much. It's all the same, you understand? And… I don’t bother with people much anymore. What’s the point? They don’t understand a man like me. They want excitement, not a steady heat source.
DOCTOR: Empty… hollow… loss of interest in things you used to enjoy… and withdrawing from people. That sounds incredibly difficult, Early. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot. And it's not uncommon to feel that way after a big change, or when you're feeling disconnected. Do you find yourself having trouble with your appetite or sleep, even though you said you sleep six hours regularly?
PATIENT: Appetite… now that you mention it, I ain’t been eating much breakfast. Just coffee, black. Used to have a nice plate of eggs and bacon. But… it just doesn’t appeal anymore. Lunch is usually a sandwich, something quick. And dinner… whatever’s easiest. Don't really crave anything, you see? And like I said, the six hours of sleep is regular, but it ain’t… restful. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. Not like I’m tossing and turning, just… no quality to it. It’s like… filling the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Loss of appetite, especially skipping breakfast, and not feeling rested despite getting six hours of sleep… those are both things we want to explore further. To get a better understanding of everything that’s going on, would you mind if I ask you a few more questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Fine. As long as it don’t involve any… fancy doctor talk. I ain’t one for complications. Just straightforward questions, if you please. I’ll answer them as best I can. But I warn you, I ain’t one for remembering dates and such.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Early. I’ll keep it simple and straightforward. Dates aren't important, just your honest answers. Have you been experiencing any changes in your weight lately?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. Now that you mention it, my trousers are feeling a bit looser. Not a lot, mind you. Just… a bit more room in the waist. I used to be a solid 180, but I reckon I’m down a few pounds. Maybe five, six. Ain’t been weighing myself regularly, though. I just noticed the fit wasn't as snug. Like everything else, I suppose. Just… easing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds lost, and noticing your trousers feeling looser… That's good information. Have you been feeling more irritable or easily frustrated than usual?
PATIENT: Irritable… well, my ex-wife, she always said I had a short fuse. But that was just her stirring things up. Now… I suppose I snap at the radio more than I used to. And the young fella at the deli, he gets on my nerves with all his chatter. Little things, you understand? Not like I’m flying into a rage, just… a quicker temper. Less patience for foolishness. It's probably just old age, to be honest. A man gets less tolerant as he gets older.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quicker temper and less patience… that’s helpful to know. Now, have you been having any difficulty concentrating, or finding it hard to remember things?
PATIENT: Concentrating… now there’s a question. Well, my work, it don’t require a lot of fancy thinking. Keep the boilers running, check the pressure, make sure everything’s in order. But… little things, you understand? I go into a room and forget why I went there. Or I’m talking to someone and can’t recall their name. Happens more than it used to, I suppose. And I used to be good with numbers, keeping track of the fuel usage. Now… I gotta write it down more often. It’s frustrating, I’ll tell you that. Makes a man feel… less sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for answering those questions so honestly, Early. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Now, I want to be clear, I’m not making a diagnosis just yet. But it's certainly something we need to explore further. To get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Depression, you say? Hmm. Sounds… serious. But I suppose a man can get down in the dumps, I don’t deny that. And a physical exam… alright. I ain’t afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just don’t go sticking anything up places, if you please. I’ve had enough of complications in my life. Blood pressure, heart and lungs… fine. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Early. Just a routine check. And absolutely no sticking anything anywhere unpleasant. If you could just hop up on the table for me, that would be great. We’ll start with your blood pressure. I'll need to expose your arm for a moment. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Do you have any trouble breathing at all?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not a bit. Always been a strong chest. Years of shoveling coal, you understand. Though the dust did get to me a bit. Used to cough something awful when I retired. But that’s settled down now. Just a little tickle in the throat sometimes. Nothing to worry about. So, what does all this poking and prodding mean, Doctor? You gonna give me some pills? I don’t much like pills.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that your breathing is good. And the cough has settled down – that's positive. No, not necessarily pills right away, Early. The poking and prodding, as you put it, is just to get a baseline understanding of your overall health. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor, and it’s something that can sometimes be managed with lifestyle changes – things like diet and exercise. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests. These will check things like your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests can help rule out any other underlying causes for how you’re feeling. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more poking and prodding, I suppose. Fine. As long as it don’t take all day. And I don’t like needles. Always been a bit squeamish. But if it helps… alright. Just get it over with quickly, if you please. And tell me what it all means afterwards. I don’t understand all that doctor talk. Thyroid, vitamin… it all goes over my head.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get it done as quickly as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. And I promise, I’ll explain everything in plain English – no doctor talk, I assure you. Let me write you a lab order. You can take this to the lab just down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. It should take about fifteen to twenty minutes. Then, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fifteen to twenty minutes… alright. Better than all day. And you promise to explain it all in plain English? That's good. I don't want any fancy terms. Just tell me what it means, if anything. Fine. Let's get this over with. I got things to do, you know. Not that I got much to do, but still. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Early. I understand, and I'll do my best to make this as easy as possible. While we wait for the lab results, is there anyone you feel comfortable talking to about how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Talking to… hmm. Not really. My ex-wife, she wouldn't care. And I don’t have much family left. Lost my brother a few years back. Used to talk to him, sometimes. But… no. I mostly keep to myself. Always have been a loner, I suppose. It's just… easier that way. Don’t want to burden anyone with my troubles. So, no. Nobody to talk to. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Early, that's not too much to ask at all. Feeling normal again is a perfectly reasonable goal, and it's something we're going to work towards together. There are resources available if you ever do feel like you want to talk to someone, even just to get things off your chest. I can give you some information about local support groups or a crisis hotline, if you’d like. No pressure at all, but it's good to know they’re there. But for now, let’s focus on getting those lab results back. Once we have those, we can make a plan. You did well coming in today, Early. That was a brave first step. Now, do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, I don’t think so. You explained everything pretty clearly. And I appreciate you not talking down to me. Some doctors… they act like you’re stupid if you don’t understand all their fancy terms. But you… you’re alright, Doctor. Just… thank you. That’s all. Now, I reckon I should get this over with. The sooner I get those tests done, the sooner I can find out what’s wrong. And maybe… maybe feel a little better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Early. And you’re right, the sooner we have those results, the better. I’m glad I could help, even a little. You take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, feeling normal again is possible.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
