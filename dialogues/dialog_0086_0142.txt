DOCTOR: Right, Jaxston Lawther. 22 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, it's... these headaches. They come on pretty strong, and I get really sweaty when they do. And my heart, it kinda races, you know? Feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest sometimes. It’s been happening on and off for… a while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: “A while now” isn’t terribly helpful, unfortunately. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay, let me think… maybe six months? Somewhere around there. It’s hard to say, honestly. They weren't every day at first, just… popping up. Now they’re probably a couple times a week. Does that help? I really don’t remember specific dates or anything. Sorry.
DOCTOR: A couple times a week for six months… alright. And when these headaches come on, where do you feel them?
PATIENT: Usually it’s… all over, kinda. Like a really bad pressure. But it feels worse in my forehead, I think. And sometimes it goes to the back of my head too. It’s hard to pinpoint. And like I said, the sweating… it’s awful. I get really clammy, and cold. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: Cold and clammy with sweating… interesting. Any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. Not always, but yeah, a couple times I’ve felt really sick to my stomach when one of these hits. Didn’t actually throw up, if that makes a difference. Just… really close to it. It’s not a regular thing, though. More like when it's a really bad one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And anything else accompany these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes things look a bit… blurry? Like I need to adjust my glasses, but even with them on, it doesn’t always help. And I feel really tired afterwards. Like completely drained. It lasts for a little while, even after the headache goes away. That's about it, I think. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and fatigue… Okay. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything previously?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I mean, I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. I had the usual childhood stuff, I guess – chickenpox, maybe? But nothing serious. And I got divorced about a year ago, if that counts as anything. Does that matter? I'm not insured, so I mostly just try to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Divorce is stressful, certainly, but not directly relevant to your current symptoms. And yes, I understand financial constraints can make seeking medical care difficult. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. I haven't broken any bones or anything, either. I'm pretty clumsy, but lucky, I guess. I just… get these headaches. And they're starting to worry me a bit. Especially with the heart racing and everything. It scares my girlfriend.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom has high blood pressure, I think. And my granddad, on my dad’s side, he had… something with his heart, I think. But I don’t really know the details. We don’t talk about that sort of thing much. He passed away a few years back. I don't really know much about their medical histories, to be honest. Sorry. I’m not very good with remembering stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. And I don't do any drugs, either. I maybe have a couple of beers on the weekend, but nothing crazy. Just to relax, you know? I'm not a big drinker. Definitely not enough to cause any trouble. I'm more of a couch potato, if anything.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Uh… nothing regular. I’ve taken ibuprofen a few times for the headaches, when they get really bad. But it doesn’t really seem to do much good, to be honest. And that's about it. Just the occasional painkiller. Nothing prescribed or anything. I try to avoid taking stuff if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I'm not exactly a doctor, you know? Heh. Just… point me in the right direction.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and neurological function. Please just relax and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Just tell me if anything feels… weird. Or if I need to do anything special. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, as expected. And I hear some… mild crackling in your lungs. Nothing major, but it's worth noting. Now, let me check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if anything hurts, right? I'm not sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… normal. Not particularly brisk or diminished. Now, I’m going to check your pupils and eye movements.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything okay? They feel fine to me, but I’m not exactly an expert, you know? It just feels… normal.
DOCTOR: Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, which is good. However, your eye movements are slightly… jerky. Not alarming, but worth noting. Now, I'm going to feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything alright? I'm a bit of a worrier, you know? Just let me know if you find anything concerning. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: No significant swelling. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The headaches, sweating, racing heart, blurry vision… these could be a sign of several things. It could be a migraine variant, a tension headache, or, less likely, something more serious. Given your slightly elevated heart rate and jerky eye movements, I want to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is that… serious? What are you looking for exactly? I’m not very good with medical stuff, you know? Just tell me plain and simple. And how much is all this going to cost? I really don't have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: A CT scan allows us to visualize your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities. It’s a precautionary measure, to be thorough. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. We’ll be looking for things like bleeding, tumors, or inflammation. As for the cost… I understand your concern. I’ll have the billing department contact you with an estimate. They may be able to offer a payment plan or connect you with resources for financial assistance. The blood work is relatively inexpensive. I want to rule out infection or any underlying medical conditions. It’s better to be safe and get a clear picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay… A payment plan would be good. Anything would be good, really. I just… I don't want this to be anything too serious. It scares my girlfriend, and I don’t want to worry her. What happens after the tests? Do I just… wait?
DOCTOR: After the tests, we’ll review the results together. I'll explain everything in detail, and we’ll discuss the best course of action. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours, and the CT scan results typically take a bit longer, maybe a few days. In the meantime, if your headaches worsen significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Okay. So… blood work and a CT scan. And wait for the results. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And for explaining everything so… plainly. I’ll schedule the tests. .
