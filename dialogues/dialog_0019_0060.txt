DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, it’s probably nothing, honestly. My mom… well, she’s been having some issues. A lot of heart stuff, and before that, her sister… it wasn’t good. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. You know, preventative stuff. Don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very smart to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart issues. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. So, when you say "heart stuff" with your mom, can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well, she gets really winded just walking to the mailbox. And there’s this… fluttering. She says it feels like a bird flapping around in her chest sometimes. She went to the hospital a couple of times because of it, they did some tests, I don’t know what tests, exactly. Something with an EKG? And they said something about her blood pressure being high. She’s on medication now, but… honestly, she doesn’t take it as much as she should. She’s… stubborn. It just… makes me nervous, you know? I feel perfectly fine now, but… what if it’s genetic?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Blain. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this, and it’s good you’re paying attention to your family history. Okay, so fluttering in the chest and shortness of breath… and high blood pressure in your mother. It is good to be aware of these things. We can definitely look into your risk factors. First, let’s talk about you. Have you been experiencing any of those same symptoms – any fluttering, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing like that. I mean, I get tired, but who doesn't? I work long hours, you know? I'm a teacher, post-secondary engineering. The students… they can be exhausting. But it's not like a heart kind of tired, if that makes sense. I can still, you know, do stuff. I go to the gym sometimes. Nothing strenuous, mostly just weights, but still. I’m pretty active, all things considered. I just… want reassurance, I guess. Is that so bad? I don't want to end up needing a cardiologist or something.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not bad at all, Blain. It’s very reasonable to want reassurance, especially with your family history. And it's good you're staying active – that’s a great start. “Not a heart kind of tired” – I understand exactly what you mean. Alright. So, you’re a post-secondary engineering teacher, active, and not experiencing any chest pain, fluttering, or shortness of breath. Good. Let's just quickly go over some other things to get a clearer picture. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes in the spring, but that’s just seasonal, I think. Not a real allergy. And I haven’t had any reactions to any medications before, as far as I know. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. No, I think I’m pretty clear on the allergy front. Honestly, I rarely even get a cold. It’s annoying, my students are always sick. I feel like I build up some sort of immunity.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Seasonal itchiness doesn’t sound like a serious allergy. And that’s actually helpful that you rarely get sick! Okay, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I used to take a multivitamin for a while, but I stopped. Honestly, I figure if I'm eating alright, I don't need it. And I don't really believe in all those supplements, you know? A lot of hype, not much substance. I try to eat healthy, mostly… sometimes I grab fast food when I'm really busy, but generally, I try to make good choices. No, definitely no regular medications or anything like that. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Coffee definitely counts! A lot of people rely on it. We won't judge. Alright, Blain, this is good information. Just a few more questions to get a good baseline. Do you have any history of high cholesterol, diabetes, or other significant medical conditions in your family besides your mother's heart issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… My grandfather, on my dad’s side, he had diabetes. Type 2, I think. And… my aunt, my mom’s sister, she had high cholesterol. She was on medication for it for years. Other than that… not really. My dad’s pretty healthy, still working at his shop. And my brother… he's a bit of a couch potato, but doesn’t seem to have any major health problems, as far as I know. Oh! And my grandmother, the one with the diabetes, she also had problems with her kidneys later in life. Is that important? I’m not sure if that runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information, Blain. Kidney problems can sometimes run in families. And diabetes and high cholesterol are both important to note. Okay, and to finish up, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like… hobbies? I guess I don’t really have a lot of hobbies. I work a lot. I grade papers, I prep lectures, I try to stay on top of research… it takes up most of my time. I used to play cricket, back in college, but I don’t have time for that anymore. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I try to get enough sleep, but it’s hard. I worry a lot. About my students, about my job… about my mom. Does that count as a lifestyle thing? It feels… stressful.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts, Blain. Stress is a very important part of your lifestyle, and worrying definitely impacts your health. It sounds like you’re very dedicated to your work, and that’s commendable, but it also sounds like it comes with a lot of pressure. Okay. So, no smoking, occasional wine, dedication to work, and significant stress. Alright. Given your family history and what you’ve told me, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic check of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. I guess. As long as it's quick. I have a lot of papers to grade, honestly. But… yeah, do what you need to do. I just want to know I'm okay. And… if there's anything I need to worry about, I want to know that too. Don't sugarcoat it, okay? I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. I won't sugarcoat anything. We'll be as thorough as we need to be, and I'll explain everything clearly. And I’ll respect your time as much as possible. Okay, if you could just hop up on the table for me. First, I'm just going to take your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Pulses are strong and equal in all extremities. Okay, everything seems normal on the initial physical exam, Blain. But, given your family history, I'd like to order some blood work. A basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. That will give us a better picture of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is necessary. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a conference next month. I don’t want to be worrying about this then.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab should be able to get the results back to us in about 3-5 business days. We'll call you as soon as they're available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them, well before your conference, so you won’t have to worry about it. In the meantime, I would recommend trying to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your routine, even if it’s just for a few minutes each day. And, since your blood pressure is slightly elevated, let’s focus on a healthy diet, limiting salt and processed foods. Do you have any questions for me, Blain?
PATIENT: No, I think… that covers it. Stress-reducing activities… yeah, I’ll try. It’s easier said than done. And the diet… I’ll keep that in mind. I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I still feel a little anxious, but… better. Knowing something is being done. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Blain. It's my pleasure. And you're right to feel a little anxious – it's understandable given your family history. Remember, we're here to support you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to stress too much. .
