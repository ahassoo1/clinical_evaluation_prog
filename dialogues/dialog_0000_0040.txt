DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, have a seat. Sixty-nine, Fijian… right. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Batara. Yes, that’s right. Sixty-nine, and Fijian born and raised. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Comes and goes, but it’s been happening quite a bit lately. And… the waterworks haven’t been right either, if you catch my meaning. It’s… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Troublesome, yes. Vague complaints are… less than helpful, Mr. Espinueva. Let's try to be specific. This pain… where exactly is it on your side?
PATIENT: Oh, excuse me, Doctor. I didn’t mean to be… vague. It’s down here, on this side. More towards the back, really. And sometimes it feels like it goes… around, you see? Not just in the back, but sort of… along here too. It’s a dull ache, mostly, but it can get quite sharp sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Dull ache, radiating… We'll get to the bottom of it. And you mentioned the "waterworks" weren’t right. Can you be a little more precise than that, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry, Doctor. It’s… I have to go to the bathroom a lot. More often than I used to, and… sometimes it burns when I go. And I feel like I never fully empty my bladder, you know? Like there’s always a little bit left. It’s… rather embarrassing to talk about, but it’s been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing is irrelevant, Mr. Espinueva. We’re here for medical information. Frequent urination, dysuria… incomplete emptying. Let's move on. Any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. No fever that I’ve noticed. No chills either. And my stomach’s been alright, thankfully. No sickness or anything like that. Just the pain and the… trouble with the waterworks. I do feel a bit tired sometimes, now that you mention it… but I thought that was just from getting older.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is hardly a diagnosis, Mr. Espinueva. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? Well, now that you mention it… there was a bit, a couple of times. Not a lot, mind you. Just… a tinge, like a little bit of pink. I thought it might have been something I ate, or… maybe I just scrubbed too hard. Old habits, you see.
DOCTOR: "Scrubbed too hard"?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I was younger, my mother always said to… well, to be thorough, you understand. She had a very particular way of things. And old habits die hard, as they say. But it’s been a long time since I noticed anything like that, until these past few times with the… waterworks. I didn't think it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Espinueva, with the pain, the frequent urination, the burning sensation, and now hematuria… we need to run some tests. This is not something to be dismissed. I’m ordering a urinalysis and a complete blood count. We’ll also need to rule out a urinary tract infection. I'm also going to need a detailed family history, if you don’t mind. Any kidney problems, bladder cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Tests… alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis and blood work… yes. Family history… hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her… waterworks too, when she got older. She didn't say exactly what, but she went to the hospital a few times for it. And my uncle, on my father’s side… he had something with his kidneys, I believe. He was always quite sickly. I don’t remember the exact details, it was a long time ago. I think they said something about… cysts?
DOCTOR: Cysts… alright. And your father?
PATIENT: My father… he was a strong man, always very healthy. Never had any trouble with his kidneys that I knew of. He worked on the sugarcane farms his whole life. Very hardy, you see. Always drinking plenty of water, and not one for complaining. He always said hard work keeps you healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I'm going to order those tests, as I said. And while we wait for the results, I want you to increase your fluid intake significantly—at least eight glasses of water a day. No sugary drinks, just water. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… yes, I can manage that. I used to drink plenty of water back when I was working. No sugary drinks, alright. And allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been a pretty simple man, not one for fancy things or… medications. I hope it's nothing too serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We'll know more once we have the results, Mr. Espinueva. I’m sending you to the lab now. The nurse will give you the necessary paperwork. And… try not to worry. Though, frankly, given your history, we need to rule out several possibilities. The hematuria is concerning. I want you to call if you experience a fever, chills, or increased pain. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. Go ahead and get that done, and we’ll discuss the results when they come back.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. I’ll go to the lab now. Thank you for seeing me. And I will call if anything changes. Hopefully, it is nothing too serious.
