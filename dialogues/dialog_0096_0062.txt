DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Burlingham. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, though most folks just call me Rayshun. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work, concerning the masks. I work as a protective service worker, and… well, I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I have some difficulties with wearing them for extended periods.
DOCTOR: Hmm. An exemption, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. It’s… not a comfortable situation, and I want to be respectful of everyone’s health, of course. It's just that my work requires a lot of… physical activity, and the masks make it difficult to breathe properly. And frankly, it causes me some distress. I’ve been trying to manage, but I am concerned it's impacting my ability to do my job effectively, and safely, for the people I serve.
DOCTOR: Distress, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. It’s a… tightening in my chest, and a bit of dizziness. Not all the time, but enough that it’s concerning. It feels like… I’m not getting enough air, and it makes me anxious. I’ve tried different kinds of masks, even the looser-fitting cloth ones, but they don't seem to help much. It's a bit difficult to explain, but it feels… confining, if that makes sense? And I want to be clear, I'm not against masks, not at all. I just… it doesn't seem to agree with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Let's get some history down. Now, you said dizziness and chest tightness. How long has this been going on with the mask wearing?
PATIENT: It started almost immediately when the mask requirement became full-time, about… six months ago, I'd say. At first, I thought it was just me needing to get used to it. But it hasn't improved. It’s gotten a little worse, to be honest. Maybe not dramatically, but enough that I find myself constantly adjusting it, trying to get more air, and then I worry about it not being secure enough. It’s a cycle, really.
DOCTOR: And before these six months, were you doing similar physical activity without issue?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. I spend a lot of time outdoors, checking on folks, walking between properties, sometimes even assisting with light lifting if needed. I’ve always been reasonably active, and I’ve never had any trouble breathing before. It really did feel sudden, once the masks were mandated. I'm a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I eat well, get plenty of rest when I can, and I'm not a smoker, if that helps. I just… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any previous medical diagnoses – heart condition, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothing like that at all. I've been lucky, thankfully. I've had the usual colds and flu over the years, but nothing serious. I get a yearly check-up with Dr. Henderson, and he’s always said my heart and lungs are strong. He's a good man, Dr. Henderson. He’s out in… well, he’s the only doctor for quite a ways around here, actually. But he always gave me a clean bill of health. I’d be happy to have him send over my records, if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: That won’t be necessary. Now, family history – anyone in your family with breathing problems?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I am aware of. My mother lived to be 85, and she was always very active, even towards the end of her life. My father passed away when I was young, but he was a rancher, very robust man, worked hard all his life without any complaints about his breathing. I have a sister, living out in Montana, and she's a marathon runner, so… no, there’s no history of breathing difficulties on either side of the family, as far as I know. I come from a hardy stock, I suppose. Though it seems like this mask is challenging that reputation a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. Just want to listen to your lungs, take your blood pressure, that sort of thing. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to. I understand. Whatever you need. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I'm hoping we can figure out something that allows me to continue doing my job safely for everyone.
DOCTOR: Alright… deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath… and out. Blood pressure is… 130 over 85. Not bad, but a little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs are… clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Everything sounds normal, Mr. Knabenshue. Perfectly normal. Which, frankly, makes this… inconvenient.
PATIENT: Inconvenient, ma’am? I don’t mean to be difficult, I assure you. I’m simply describing what I’m experiencing. It's difficult to explain, because everything does sound normal, I understand that. But it feels… constricting, like it's cutting off my air supply. Perhaps it's anxiety then? I've never really experienced anything like this before, and I'm admittedly a bit nervous about the whole situation. Would that explain the elevated blood pressure? I try to remain calm, but… it's a worry.
DOCTOR: Anxiety can cause those symptoms, yes. But to exempt you from a workplace safety regulation based on… feelings, Mr. Knabenshue, is… problematic. Now, have you considered… mindfulness exercises?
PATIENT: Mindfulness exercises, ma'am? I… hadn't considered that, no. I’ve always been a practical man, focused on doing the work. I’m used to being outdoors, a lot of space around me, fresh air. Being confined, even with a mask, just… feels unnatural, I suppose. I’m willing to try anything, honestly. But I'm not sure… sitting quietly and focusing on my breathing while trying to assist someone in a crisis seems… counterproductive, if I may be frank. Wouldn’t it be more helpful to find a mask that fits better, or perhaps explore alternative protective measures? I understand safety is paramount, and I wouldn't want to compromise that in any way. But I'm worried about my ability to perform my duties effectively if I'm constantly distracted by my discomfort.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, I’ve said everything sounds normal. And frankly, a protective services worker needing an exemption for a mask?
PATIENT: I understand your skepticism, ma’am. It’s not something I requested lightly, and I wouldn't want to appear to be making excuses. But my work… it’s demanding, physically and emotionally. I'm often responding to crises, assisting vulnerable individuals, and needing to think quickly under pressure. The mask… it feels like an added obstacle, something that’s hindering my ability to perform those duties effectively. I'm not asking for special treatment, just for a solution that allows me to continue serving my community safely. Perhaps a thorough assessment of my work environment, or a trial period with a different type of mask? I'm open to suggestions, and willing to cooperate in any way possible. I just… I want to be able to do my job, and do it well. And right now, I'm concerned that the mask is preventing me from doing that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. I think what we’ll do is this. You try the mindfulness exercises. And you wear the mask. We’ll revisit this in a month. If you are still experiencing these… difficulties, then we’ll consider a referral to a specialist. A psychologist, perhaps. Now, is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A psychologist, ma’am? Well, I suppose it’s better than nothing. I'm willing to try anything, as I said. Mindfulness exercises… and continue wearing the mask. And then revisit in a month. If I am still experiencing difficulties, a referral to a psychologist. Very well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, Doctor. I will follow your instructions, and hopefully we can find a resolution. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. And Mr. Knabenshue?
