DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding some test results from a GI endoscopy I had done recently, and it seems there were some… abnormalities noted. I must confess, I’m not entirely sure what that means, precisely, but I wanted to discuss it with you. It's rather concerning, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the report here… abnormalities. Right. Hmm. Okay. And when did you have this endoscopy performed, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: It was on July 12th of this year, Doctor. At St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Ramirez performed it, a very capable woman, though I confess I was quite nervous. They gave me something to make me sleep, thankfully. I remember very little of the procedure itself.
DOCTOR: July 12th…Dr. Ramirez. Good. Okay. The report… it indicates some inflammation and… polyps were identified. Can you tell me, have you experienced any symptoms – anything at all – that prompted this endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. For some months now, perhaps six or seven, I've had a rather persistent discomfort in my abdomen. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… gnawing sensation, really. And I’ve noticed a change in my… bowel habits, if you don’t mind me being so direct. It’s been rather irregular, and sometimes there’s been… well, blood. Not a great deal, but enough to cause me worry. It started slowly, but it’s become more frequent recently.
DOCTOR: Abdominal discomfort, irregular bowel habits, and blood… Right. And is the blood bright red, dark, or… something else?
PATIENT: It’s usually a darker shade, Doctor. Not a vibrant red, more of a… maroon colour, I suppose. And it’s not every time, but often enough to be unsettling. I do apologize for being so graphic, but I believe it’s important to be thorough, don’t you agree? I haven't noticed any dizziness or fatigue associated with it, if that’s of consequence.
DOCTOR: No, it’s important to be thorough. Maroon colour… alright. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or unintended weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. My appetite has been rather normal, and I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. I may have gained a little, actually, but I attribute that to my fondness for my daughter’s cooking. She insists on feeding me very well. No nausea or vomiting at all. It really is mostly this discomfort and the… issue with my bowel. It's unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of colon cancer or any other gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother passed away when I was quite young, from… complications, the doctors said. I don't recall the specifics. And my father… he was a strong man, but he didn’t speak much about his health. I don't believe there was any history of colon cancer, at least not that I am aware of. My brother, however, did have a rather troublesome case of diverticulitis several years ago, if that is relevant. He recovered, thankfully, but it was a difficult time for him.
DOCTOR: Diverticulitis… okay. And just to clarify, Ms. Minatra, you said you haven't noticed any dizziness or fatigue?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No dizziness, no unusual fatigue. I tire easily, perhaps, but I am 67 years of age, you understand. A certain amount of slowing down is to be expected. No, I haven’t experienced anything that would suggest anything more serious than simply… aging. It’s this discomfort, and the… changes, that worry me. I hope it is nothing too dire. I do try to remain optimistic, but… one hears such frightening stories.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the report and your symptoms, we need to investigate this further. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. Then, we'll discuss some potential next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is a sensible precaution, I believe. I trust your judgement entirely. Please, proceed at your convenience. I'm ready when you are. Just… try to be gentle, if you wouldn't mind. My bones aren’t quite as sturdy as they once were.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. If you could lie down on your back, please. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. I'm hearing… normal bowel sounds. No immediate concerns there. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little discomfort just here, on the lower left side. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It’s the same area where I usually feel the discomfort. It’s not excruciating, but it’s definitely noticeable. And… perhaps a little tenderness here, on the right side as well, but less pronounced. It’s difficult to say, you understand, I’m not particularly accustomed to being prodded and poked. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Lower left quadrant tenderness, some mild tenderness in the right quadrant… alright. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn't elicit any particular pain. It's mostly confined to those lower areas, as I mentioned. And… sometimes it radiates a little towards my back, but it's fleeting. It's a rather vague discomfort, to be honest. It's not a localized, stabbing pain, more of a generalized ache. I hope that makes sense. I’m trying to be as precise as possible, but it’s a difficult sensation to describe. Is there anything else I can do to assist you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. That's helpful. No masses palpable, no significant organomegaly. Based on this exam, and the report from the endoscopy, I'm concerned about the possibility of diverticulitis, or potentially, early-stage colon cancer, though it’s far too early to say definitively. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, if you deem it necessary, Doctor. I trust your professional opinion entirely. I confess, the mention of… cancer, is rather unsettling, but I understand it’s best to be thorough. A CT scan, you say? Will it involve any radiation? And… will I need to prepare for it in any way? I do hope it’s not too invasive. I haven't had many medical procedures in my life, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, a CT scan does involve some radiation, but it’s a relatively low dose. We always weigh the risks and benefits, and in your case, I believe the potential benefits of getting a clear diagnosis outweigh the risks. As for preparation, you’ll need to drink a contrast dye – it helps to visualize the bowel better. You may also need a bowel prep, depending on the radiologist’s preferences, to clear out your colon. I’ll have the radiology department contact you with specific instructions. It’s not particularly invasive; you'll lie on a table while the scanner takes images. Do you have any allergies, particularly to iodine or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any known allergies. Not to iodine, not to anything, as far as I am aware. My daughter is rather meticulous about my health, and she would certainly know if I did. She always insists on a detailed medical history form whenever I see a doctor. A bowel prep, you say? Oh dear. That doesn't sound particularly pleasant. But, if it's necessary, I suppose I can manage. Is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking in the days leading up to the scan? And… how long will the scan take? I have a small gathering planned with my family next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to avoid anything specific in the days leading up to the scan, just follow the prep instructions carefully when you receive them. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The radiology department will schedule it for you. We'll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss the next steps at that time. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve addressed all of my concerns. Thank you for your thoroughness and your patience. You’ve put my mind at ease, somewhat. I shall await the call from the radiology department and follow their instructions carefully. And I shall be sure to contact the emergency room if anything… worsens. Thank you again for your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any further questions or concerns before your scan. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. And please, call if anything changes. .
