DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Auelua, you say? Scottish, right? My niece, she… she went to Scotland once. Nice place, I hear. Anyway, I’m here ‘cause… well, it’s hard to breathe sometimes. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too, all dry-like. It’s been… a while now. Not sure exactly how long. Just… happens.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Scottish. It’s a beautiful country. Glad to hear your niece enjoyed it! Okay, so it sounds like you're experiencing some shortness of breath and dryness in your mouth and eyes. You said it’s been going on for a while… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: A while… yes. Look, I’m not good with dates. Things just… blur together, you know? It started… I think after the heat wave last summer? Maybe. Or was it the summer before? It just… gets worse when I’m walking. Especially uphill. I used to be able to walk anywhere. Now… not so much. I get… winded. And thirsty. Always thirsty.
DOCTOR: I understand, dates can be tricky. It's helpful you can tie it to the heat wave, that gives us a starting point. So, the shortness of breath and thirst seem to be getting worse, especially with activity like walking uphill. Okay, just to clarify, is this shortness of breath a sudden thing, or does it build up gradually when you’re walking?
PATIENT: Gradually. Definitely gradually. It doesn’t just hit me all at once. I start walking, feel okay. Then… a little harder to get the air. Then… harder again. And harder. Until I gotta stop. It’s… annoying. Used to be a strong man, you know? Traffic work is hard work. Lots of walking, lots of… lifting. Now… Not like before.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it builds up as you exert yourself. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath and thirst?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me think. I get tired easier, I guess. Real tired. Even after a good night’s sleep. And… sometimes my ankles swell up. Not always, but… sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. They get… puffy. Does that count? What is a symptom anyway? I forget these things. Old age, you know? Makes you foggy.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts! Fatigue and ankle swelling are important to know. So, to recap: shortness of breath that builds with activity, increased thirst, fatigue, and ankle swelling, especially at the end of the day. Now, have you had any chest pain or discomfort with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… No, not really. Not like a heart attack or anything. It's… a tightness, maybe? Sometimes, when I'm really struggling to breathe, it feels like my chest is… squeezed. But it's not pain. More like… uncomfortable. A heavy feeling. And it goes away when I rest. Not a big deal, I don't think. I’ve had worse. Lots of aches and pains when you get to be my age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a tightness or heavy feeling in your chest with the shortness of breath, not a sharp pain, and it improves with rest. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me something about that, years ago. Something about watching my salt intake. I think. Honestly, I forget most of what those doctors tell me. I go, they poke around, they tell me things… it all goes in one ear and out the other. Diabetes? No, I don’t think so. I like sweets, always have, but no one ever said anything about… sugar problems. Heart problems… No, never been told anything about my heart. Used to be strong as an ox! But like I said, things change. Lots of things. .
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure mentioned in the past, but you don't recall specifics, and no known diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
