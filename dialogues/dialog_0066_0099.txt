DOCTOR: Hi Denis, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I received some… results back from a test, an examination of my insides, and it seems there was something unusual detected. I believe it was called an Endo test? I’m not entirely certain of the specifics, but my previous physician suggested I come in for a discussion.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. An “Endo test” likely refers to an endoscopy – a procedure where we look inside your digestive tract with a camera. It's good you're following up on those results. And don’t worry about not remembering all the specifics, that’s what I’m here for. Do you happen to have a copy of those results with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, Doctor. I made certain to bring all the papers I received. It’s a rather thick file, actually. Here you are. I apologize for the slight disorganization; I wasn’t feeling entirely myself when I gathered everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. No need to apologize at all. We’ll get through this together. Let me take a look… Alright, here we are. I see this is a report from an upper endoscopy performed on July 15th, 2025. It does show some findings in your esophagus and stomach. Before we dive into the specifics, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. For several months, I’d been experiencing a… discomfort, a burning sensation in my chest, particularly after meals. And occasionally, I would have trouble swallowing. It wasn’t constant, but frequent enough to cause me worry. My previous doctor thought it wise to investigate further, and that led to this examination. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s unsettling, Denis. Chest pain and difficulty swallowing definitely warrant investigation. Okay, so burning sensation after meals and intermittent trouble swallowing – how often would you say this trouble swallowing occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not every day, not at all. Perhaps… two or three times a week, on average? Sometimes it's just a slight hesitation, a feeling of something getting caught, and other times it's more noticeable – I have to take smaller bites, or drink water to help it go down. It’s been gradually worsening over the past few months, which is why I sought medical attention. It hasn't been debilitating, but… concerning, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, two or three times a week, gradually worsening. And you mentioned it feels like something getting caught?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s precisely it. Like a small obstruction, or… a tightening. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not painful, not usually, but uncomfortable and… worrisome. I’ve always been a rather… cautious person, and any change in my health tends to cause me some anxiety. It may be that I simply overthink things.
DOCTOR: No, it's good you’re paying attention to changes in your health and seeking answers, Denis. That’s exactly what I want my patients to do. Okay, so no pain with swallowing, just discomfort and a feeling of something getting caught. Now, the report here indicates some inflammation and a small area of concern in your esophagus. It mentions “Barrett’s esophagus” and recommends a biopsy. Have you been told about Barrett’s esophagus before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Barrett’s esophagus… that is a new term to me. I confess, I don’t recall my previous physician mentioning it specifically. Is it… serious? I apologize for my directness, but I prefer to know everything upfront, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Denis. It's good to be direct. Barrett’s esophagus is a condition where the lining of your esophagus changes. It happens often in people who have long-term acid reflux, or heartburn. The lining changes because of the repeated exposure to stomach acid. It's not cancer, but it can increase your risk of esophageal cancer over time, which is why we do biopsies to check for any abnormal cells. The biopsy is a very small sample of tissue taken during the endoscopy to be examined under a microscope. Do you experience heartburn frequently?
PATIENT: Ah, I see. So it's a precautionary measure, to ensure there’s no cause for further concern. That’s… reassuring, to a degree. And yes, Doctor, I do experience heartburn. Perhaps not every day, but several times a week, particularly after eating certain foods – spicy foods, citrus fruits, things like that. I’ve always assumed it was simply my constitution. I’ve tried over-the-counter remedies, antacids mostly, and they usually provide some relief, but it hasn’t entirely disappeared. Is that a significant factor, then, in relation to this Barrett’s esophagus?
DOCTOR: Yes, Denis, frequent heartburn is a major factor. Long-term exposure to acid is what causes the lining of the esophagus to change. The report also notes some hiatal hernia, which can contribute to acid reflux. Now, let’s talk about the biopsy. It has already been done, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. The examination that produced these results was the endoscopy, and I understood it involved taking small samples. So, you have those samples already, for analysis? And the results will determine the next course of action? I trust your judgment entirely, Doctor. My previous physician was retiring, and I am still getting accustomed to new medical professionals.
DOCTOR: That’s good, yes, we have the biopsy samples. And you’re right, the results will determine the next steps. Alright, let me take a look at these results… Okay. The report shows some mild inflammation and changes consistent with Barrett’s esophagus, but thankfully, no dysplasia. Dysplasia means abnormal cells, and the absence of that is good news. It suggests this is early-stage Barrett’s and doesn’t require immediate, aggressive treatment. However, because you do have Barrett’s, we will need to monitor it with regular endoscopies, usually every two to three years, to check for any changes. We also need to address the acid reflux to prevent it from worsening.
PATIENT: That is… a relief, Doctor, truly. No dysplasia is certainly encouraging. And regular monitoring sounds… sensible, a prudent approach. As for the acid reflux… what measures do you recommend? I have been relying on those over-the-counter remedies, but perhaps something more… comprehensive is required? I am willing to make any necessary adjustments to my lifestyle, if that is what is best. I have always prided myself on taking care of my health.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Denis. Proactive is always best. First, let’s talk about lifestyle changes. Elevating the head of your bed six to eight inches can help prevent acid from flowing back up while you sleep. Avoiding eating large meals, especially before bedtime, is also important. We should also identify and avoid foods that trigger your heartburn – spicy foods, citrus fruits, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages are common culprits. Losing weight, if you're overweight, can also help. Medication-wise, we can start with a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, like omeprazole. This reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you respond. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That all sounds… quite manageable, actually. Elevating the bed is simple enough, and I can certainly make adjustments to my diet. I do enjoy my citrus fruits, admittedly, but my health is paramount. A PPI, then… are there any potential side effects I should be aware of? And how long would I typically need to take this medication? I apologize for the numerous questions, Doctor, but I prefer to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: No questions are too many, Denis, I want you to feel comfortable. PPIs are generally safe, but long-term use can have some potential side effects, though they’re relatively uncommon. These can include an increased risk of certain infections, like pneumonia or C. difficile, and a possible decrease in absorption of certain vitamins, like B12. We will monitor you for any signs of these, and we can check your vitamin levels periodically. The length of treatment depends on your response and the severity of your symptoms. We can start with a course of 8 weeks and then reassess. If your symptoms improve, we can try tapering off the medication gradually. If they don’t improve, we may need to consider further investigation or a higher dose. Do you have any allergies to medications we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no known allergies to medications. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. That is… reassuring. So, to summarize, we begin with the lifestyle adjustments, and the course of PPIs for eight weeks. Then, a reassessment, and a possible tapering off, depending on my response. Is that correct? And are there any resources you could recommend, perhaps a website or pamphlet, regarding dietary changes for acid reflux? I prefer to have something in writing, to refer to when I am at the market.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ve got it perfectly, Denis. Lifestyle adjustments and eight weeks of PPIs, then reassess. And absolutely, I can provide you with some resources. Here is a pamphlet from the American Gastroenterological Association with a comprehensive list of foods to avoid and foods to favor when managing acid reflux. And this website, [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361918], has a lot of helpful information as well. I’m also going to write you a prescription for omeprazole 20mg once daily for 8 weeks. Take it first thing in the morning, 30 minutes before breakfast. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: That is wonderfully comprehensive, Doctor. The pamphlet and the website are most appreciated. And the prescription instructions are clear. No, I believe that covers everything, for the moment. I am most grateful for your thoroughness and your patience. You have certainly put my mind at ease. I shall follow your instructions diligently, and I will schedule a follow-up appointment as advised. Thank you again, Dr. Condray.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll see you in about three months, then. Take care of yourself, and feel free to call the office if anything changes. Have a good day.
