DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's my chest. It's been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? Like a… a tight feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight feeling in your chest. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three weeks now? It started small, I didn't even pay much attention. But it’s been getting worse the last few days. It happens when I walk, mostly. Or if I climb the stairs.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s related to exertion – walking, stairs. And you said it’s gotten worse over the last few days. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… a squeezing. Like someone is holding my chest really tight. And sometimes it goes up into my jaw a little. Not always, but sometimes. It scares me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing pain that sometimes radiates to your jaw. That's good information. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Yes! When I stop and rest, it goes away pretty quick. Maybe five minutes, ten minutes if I really pushed myself. And I find… if I sit down and take some deep breaths, that helps too.
DOCTOR: Alright, resting and deep breaths help. Do you feel any shortness of breath with this pain, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not always, but when the squeezing is really bad, it's hard to get a good breath. It feels like I’m not getting enough air, you know? It doesn't last long though, just while the chest hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms with this – like nausea, sweating, dizziness, or pain in your arm or shoulder?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. A little bit of sweating. Not a lot, but I’ve noticed I feel kind of clammy sometimes when the chest hurts. And… my left arm feels a little heavy. Not painful, exactly, but… not normal. The nausea, no. And I haven’t felt dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so sweating and a heavy feeling in your left arm. Let's get a quick look at your medical history. Okay, I see you have some history of high blood pressure, and high cholesterol... Are you currently taking any medications for those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a pill for the blood pressure, every morning. And another one for the cholesterol. I think it’s called… atorvastatin? Something like that. I have them right here in my purse. Here they are.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Lisinopril for the blood pressure and Atorvastatin for the cholesterol. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had an allergy to a pill before. I'm lucky that way, I guess. My husband, he's allergic to everything! But me, no. Just a little sensitive stomach sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 85. Pulses are present and regular in all extremities. No edema noted. Let’s check your oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is 96%, which is good.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good, I guess. What does all that mean, Doctor? The murmur and the… whatever you said. I’m a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Chelberg, let’s talk about that. The murmur is a common finding and doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious on its own, especially given your history of high blood pressure. However, combined with your symptoms – the chest tightness, the pain with exertion, the radiating pain to your jaw, the sweating, and the heavy arm – it raises my concern for possible angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I want to order a couple of tests. An EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a blood test to look for cardiac enzymes, which can indicate if there’s been any damage to the heart muscle. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Angina… that sounds scary. Is that… serious? The tests sound okay, yes. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Will the tests take long? And will they hurt? I don't do well with needles…
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Chelberg, it’s good you’re asking questions. Angina can be serious, but it’s also often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. The tests themselves are relatively quick and straightforward. The EKG is painless – we just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, but it's usually over quickly. We’ll get the results back relatively quickly, hopefully within a few hours. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity, and if you experience any chest pain, stop immediately and rest. I’m also going to prescribe you a nitroglycerin tablet to keep on hand. If you have chest pain, you put it under your tongue, and it can help to open up the blood vessels and relieve the pain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Nitroglycerin… under the tongue? That sounds… strong. What if it doesn’t work, Doctor? And what if it makes things worse? I always worry about side effects. Lifestyle changes… what kind of changes? I try to eat healthy, but I do love my arepas!
DOCTOR: Okay, those are very good questions, Ms. Chelberg. Nitroglycerin is a powerful medication, but it’s generally safe when used as directed. It works by widening the blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow to your heart. If it doesn’t relieve the pain after one tablet in five minutes, you can take another one, up to three tablets. If the pain still doesn’t go away after that, you need to go to the emergency room immediately, as it could be a sign of a more serious problem. As for side effects, some people experience a slight headache or dizziness, but those usually go away quickly. As for lifestyle changes, we’re talking about things like reducing your salt intake, eating a heart-healthy diet – less fried foods, more fruits and vegetables – and getting regular exercise. I understand you enjoy your arepas, and that’s okay, but moderation is key. We can also talk to a nutritionist about ways to incorporate healthier options into your diet. Does that help address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes more sense. The emergency room… that’s good to know. Okay, I will try the nitroglycerin if the pain comes back. And I will try to eat less salt. And maybe… smaller arepas. Okay, Doctor. What happens next? Do I need to go somewhere else for these tests, or will you do them here? And how long will I be here? I have a friend coming to pick me up later.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can do both tests right here in the clinic. The EKG will only take a few minutes, and the blood draw won’t take much longer. I estimate you’ll be here for about 30-45 minutes total. After the blood work, we'll wait for the results, and I’ll discuss them with you and formulate a plan. I will also give you written instructions on how to use the nitroglycerin, and information on recognizing the signs of a heart attack. And I’ll also give you a referral to a cardiologist, just to get a second opinion and for more specialized care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. 30-45 minutes… that’s okay. I’ll call my friend and let her know I might be a little late. Okay. Let's do the tests then. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with the EKG. I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up. She'll explain everything as she goes. Just lie back on the examination table and relax. We’ll be right back. Nurse, can you please come in and start an EKG for Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you.
