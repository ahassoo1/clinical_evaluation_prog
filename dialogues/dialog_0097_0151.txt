DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to find out what it is, if you can. I don’t like feeling… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. That does sound bothersome. “A little while now” – can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… three, maybe four months? It started slowly, just a little pins and needles feeling, really. I thought I was just sitting funny or something. But it hasn’t gone away, and now it’s more… constant, you know? Not painful, exactly, just… there. It's worse at night, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, started gradually, more constant now, and worse at night. That gives me a little more to work with. And it's only your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes I feel it a little bit in my toes, but that could just be my shoes, honestly. I'm on my feet all day for work, you see. Postal carrier. It’s a lot of walking. I haven’t noticed it anywhere else, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, postal carrier – that’s good to know. Being on your feet all day is definitely relevant. And no other symptoms—no weakness, numbness, changes in skin color, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No weakness, no… changes in color. Just the tingling. It doesn’t really bother me when I’m busy, to be honest. But when I sit down at night, that’s when I really notice it. It’s… annoying, more than anything. I just want it to stop, you know? I’m a widow now, and I like to knit in the evenings, but it’s hard when my hands feel funny.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re able to distract yourself with knitting when you can, but it’s definitely a problem if it interferes with things you enjoy. You mentioned being a widow – I'm sorry for your loss. And you said it doesn’t cause pain, but is it interfering with your grip strength at all with the knitting?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It was a few years ago now, but I appreciate that. And yes, actually, it is. Not terribly, but I drop stitches more than I used to. It's hard to hold the needles steady sometimes, especially the smaller ones. And I've started using bigger needles, which isn't ideal. I don't want to ruin my tension, you know? It’s a silly thing to worry about, maybe, but… I like my knitting.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Teretha. Knitting is a perfectly valid reason to want to get this figured out! Okay, let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It’ll just take a few minutes. Could you please sit on the examination table and I'll start with your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Sounds good. Just tell me what to do. I haven't had a proper exam in… well, a long time. I try to stay healthy, you know? A lot of walking keeps me going.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Walking is excellent. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but not dramatically so. And sensation seems… slightly reduced, particularly in your toes. Strength is good, no noticeable weakness there. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I'll do the same tests on this side. Could you open and close your hands for me a few times?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. There. I don’t think I'm as strong as I used to be, but… well, I’m 63, Doctor. Things start to go, you know? It’s just… life. But I still get all my mail delivered on time, if that’s any indication!
DOCTOR: That is a good indication! And you're right, some changes are normal with age. Okay, your grip strength is a bit weaker on this side as well, but nothing alarming. Now, I'm going to feel your pulses in your feet and ankles to check your circulation. Pulses are good, normal circulation. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it could be peripheral neuropathy. That just means there’s some irritation or damage to the nerves in your hands and feet. There are a lot of possible causes, from diabetes to vitamin deficiencies to just… age. I’d like to do some blood work to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Nerves? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? And blood work… alright, alright, I suppose so. If it will help. I don’t have… insurance, though. Will it be very expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. And I don’t want to get into trouble. I just want this tingling to stop.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Teretha. "Neuropathy" just means nerve issue, and it doesn't automatically mean anything serious. Most of the time it’s manageable. We need to find out why it’s happening, and the blood work will give us a good starting point. It will check your blood sugar, vitamin levels , thyroid function, and a few other things. As for cost… I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me check the prices for you. Okay, the basic panel will be around $150. The lab does offer a discount for cash payments, bringing it down to $120. We can also see if there are any assistance programs available in the area. Would you like me to look into those for you?
PATIENT: $120… alright. That’s… manageable, I think. But I really don’t want to get a bigger bill later. Assistance programs… yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind. I’d appreciate that very much. I just want to know what’s going on, you see? And get this tingling to stop. It’s just… annoying, is all. When can I get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We’ll get this sorted out. Here’s a lab order for Quest Diagnostics, there’s a location on Elm Street, about a 15-minute walk from here. You can go anytime during their business hours. Once you have the results, you can either have them sent directly to me, or you can bring them back here. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Oh, just send them to you, please. That's easier. I’m not very good with computers, you see. I just want you to have the results. Elm Street… alright, I know where that is. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. And… hopefully, it’s not something too serious. I really appreciate you looking into the assistance programs. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I'm glad I could help. No, that’s all for now. Just get the blood work done when you have a chance, and we’ll go from there. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid anything that seems to worsen the tingling, and continue to do the things you enjoy as much as possible. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like weakness, numbness, or pain. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least. I appreciate you taking the time. I'll go get the blood work done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you.
