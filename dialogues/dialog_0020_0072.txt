DOCTOR: Good morning, Ebony. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not huge things, usually, but enough that it’s starting to worry me. It’s the little things, you know? Like where I put my keys, or names of people I’ve met recently. It's just... not how it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Ebony. It’s good you’re bringing this up. Forgetfulness can be concerning, and we want to figure out what’s going on. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's hard to pinpoint exactly. Probably… six months ago, maybe? At first, I just thought I was stressed with work. Being a dentist is… demanding. But it’s been happening more and more lately, even when things are calm. I wouldn't say it's gotten drastically worse, just... consistent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Consistent is a helpful detail. And work stress can absolutely contribute. To get a clearer picture, can you describe a typical forgetting incident?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think… Yesterday, for example. A patient came in, a younger man, I’d seen him before, maybe twice. I knew his face, I knew I did, but I couldn't for the life of me remember his name. I had to ask the receptionist, and it was right there on the schedule! It just… wouldn’t come to me. And then, this morning I went to brush my teeth and completely forgot why I was in the bathroom! I just stood there for a minute, staring at the sink. It’s stuff like that. Little things. Not blacking out or anything, just… blanks.
DOCTOR: Okay, those are helpful examples, Ebony. It sounds like short-term memory lapses. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve consciously noticed. I haven't felt confused, or disoriented. No trouble with directions, or recognizing people… just the little things, like I said. I have been a bit more tired lately, but I always chalk that up to long hours. Honestly, I'm not sure if that's connected or just… life. Does that make sense? I'm really trying to think, but it’s all so… subtle.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it's good you’re being so thorough. Subtle changes can be the most important. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries… I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well, exercise when I can, but it’s hard with the job. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, I think… everything I needed to be, anyway. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I'm just trying to think if I'm leaving something out.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing great. I just want to get a full picture. Any family history of memory issues, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… well, she got very confused towards the end of her life. The doctors said it was “age-related decline,” but it wasn’t really a formal diagnosis, if that makes sense. She just… forgot more and more things. My mother never really talked about it much, it was… sad. My father’s side of the family, everyone seems pretty sharp. So… maybe my grandmother? It wasn't really a clear-cut case, if that makes sense. Does that help? It's a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Even unclear details can be important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be safe, but that's about it. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I don't have any allergies, either. Just the usual seasonal stuff, but nothing that requires medication. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s very rare. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's helpful. Now, just to get a little more background… Can you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I live alone, I've been single for a while now. I own my own dental practice, which takes up most of my time. I try to stay active, I go for walks when I can, and I enjoy reading. I don’t really drink or smoke. I eat… decently, I guess. It's hard to cook for myself, so I often grab something quick after work. Socially, I don't get out much, to be honest. Work is… my life, mostly. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I’m not very exciting, I'm afraid!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ebony. It’s helpful to have a full picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief neurological exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know what I need to do. I'm a little nervous, to be honest, but I'm glad I came in. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. First, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I gently tap her knees with a reflex hammer, observing the response. I then check her pupils with a penlight, noting their size and reactivity. Both reflexes are normal and pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. Now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… let me think… it’s… August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think it’s right. I try to keep track, but sometimes I lose track of the days. It's silly, I know. But it's a little embarrassing. Is that correct? I just double-checked on my phone, to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. It’s perfectly alright to double-check. Now, could you please spell “world” backwards for me?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think… d-l-r-o-w? Is that right? Oh dear. That feels… wrong. I know how to spell it, normally. It's just… backwards is always tricky. I'm really sorry. I feel like I should know that. Is that bad? It just... didn’t come easily.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s a challenging task. Let’s try something else. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me, and then I’ll ask you to recall them after a few minutes. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Go ahead. I'll try my best. I hope I can remember them, this is a little stressful!
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay, I think I have them. Apple, table, penny. It feels… okay. Is that right? I’m nervous I'm going to forget one!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, let’s move on to some simple mental calculations. What’s 7 times 9?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think… 7 times 9… That's… tricky. Is it 63? I think it's 63. I'm terrible at math, always have been! Hopefully, I'm right. It just took me a moment to figure it out. I used to be better at these things. Is it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, let’s put those numbers away for a bit. I’m going to ask a few simple questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Um… it’s 2025, right? Yes, 2025. I feel like I'm doing okay so far, but I'm worried I'm going to mess something up! It's just… a little stressful. I'm trying to concentrate!
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Ebony. Don’t worry. Now, who is the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… um… I feel like I should know this! Is it… Biden? Yes, I think it’s Biden. It feels right. It's just… I'm a little distracted by everything else, I think. Is that correct? I'm really sorry if I get something wrong! I’m just a bit flustered.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Alright, let’s see if you can remember those three words I asked you earlier. What were they?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think… This is the part I was worried about. Three words… Oh dear. Was one of them… apple? And… was another one table? And… um… I’m drawing a blank on the third one. Oh, this is terrible! I’m so sorry, I can’t remember the last word. I know I wrote them down… oh dear. I feel so silly! I'm just blanking. I'm really sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ebony. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with recall. Now, let's move on to a quick assessment of your mood. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very sad and 10 being very happy, how would you rate your mood today?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I would say… maybe a 6? I'm not terribly sad, but I'm definitely not overjoyed. I'm a little anxious about all of this, to be honest. And a little embarrassed. So… maybe a 6. Is that helpful? It's hard to put a number on things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Now, are you experiencing any difficulties with sleep – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested when you wake up?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been having a bit of trouble sleeping lately. It takes me a while to fall asleep, and I often wake up in the middle of the night, and then have trouble getting back to sleep. And when I do wake up, I don’t feel very rested. It's not terrible, but it's… noticeable. It feels like my mind is just racing, even when I'm tired. Is that helpful? I've been hoping it would get better on its own.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Okay, Ebony, that concludes the neurological and brief mood assessment. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, you’re experiencing some short-term memory lapses, difficulty with recall, and some sleep disturbance. It sounds like you’re still functioning well overall, but these are things we need to investigate further. It is difficult to be certain without further work up. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes – things like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. Also, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. MRI sounds a little scary, to be honest, but if that’s what you recommend… yes, let’s do it. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully, it’s nothing serious. What’s involved with the blood work? Will it take long? And… how long will it take to get the results of the MRI? I’m a bit nervous, but I'm glad I came in. I'm ready to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The blood work is fairly simple. We’ll just need a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and then we’ll send it to the lab. The results usually come back within a few days. The MRI will take a little longer, around 30-40 minutes. You’ll lie inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s completely painless, but it can be a little loud, so we'll provide you with headphones. We should have the results back within a week or so. In the meantime, I recommend trying to prioritize sleep. Establish a regular bedtime routine, avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed, and make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. We can also discuss some strategies to help improve your memory. Would you like me to schedule the blood work and MRI for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. I’d really appreciate that. Just get it done. I'm ready to get this process started. I am a bit nervous about the MRI, but I'm glad I came in, and I trust you. If you have any recommendations for helping me relax during the MRI, please let me know. I have been a little anxious lately, so I'm trying to prepare. Do I need to do anything special beforehand? Do I need a ride?
DOCTOR: Okay, I've scheduled the blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The MRI is scheduled for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. For the MRI, you can listen to music during the scan, which many patients find helpful for relaxation. If you have any metal implants, it's important to let the technician know beforehand. You can eat and drink normally before the scan. You will need a ride, as we don't recommend driving immediately afterwards. It’s also helpful to avoid wearing any jewelry or metal objects. I'm going to provide you with a referral to a cognitive therapist, just in case it is related to stress or anxiety. I’ll also give you a handout with some tips for improving your memory and reducing stress. And, I want to reiterate, you’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out. We’ll figure out what’s going on and come up with a plan to help you feel better. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor, and I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for being so understanding. I’m a little nervous, but I feel better knowing that we’re getting this checked out. I’ll make sure to schedule a ride for the MRI and I will make sure I don't have anything metal on. I will follow all of your instructions. Thank you again. And… if I think of anything later, can I call the office?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ebony. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. We’re here to help. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll see you next Tuesday, and best of luck tomorrow with the bloodwork. Have a good day, Ebony. .
