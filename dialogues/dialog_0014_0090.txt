DOCTOR: Right. Mackenzi Brightful, 29 years old. Hello, Mackenzi. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Osterholm. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I’m here for a check-up before a surgery? It’s… something I’ve been planning for a little while. Honestly, the details are a bit hazy, but my understanding is this is to make sure I’m healthy enough to proceed?
DOCTOR: Hm. A surgery check-up… Yes, I see a note here about a… elective procedure scheduled. Honestly, the documentation isn’t very clear. Vague, to say the least. But, alright. We'll get to the bottom of it. Before we focus on being healthy enough, can you tell me what kind of surgery you’re having?
PATIENT: That… is a very good question. I wish I could tell you with certainty. It has to do with… well, with how I look, I suppose. My husband… he always admired a certain feature. And… after he passed, I decided it was time. But the specifics… they're just not coming to me. I apologize. It feels terribly foolish to not remember, but it's been a difficult few years. Perhaps you have more information on file?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand things are difficult. But "how you look" isn't a diagnosis. And frankly, this chart is a mess. It says "cosmetic procedure consultation"… and then nothing concrete. It lists a Dr. Klein, but no further details. Alright. Let’s try this another way. Do you remember where you scheduled the surgery?
PATIENT: No, I truly don't. It was… recommended, I think. A friend might have suggested Dr. Klein? Or perhaps it was through a brochure. I handled so many arrangements after… after everything, and it’s all a bit of a blur. I'm so sorry for being so unhelpful. I really thought the clinic would have a more complete record. It feels as if I'm failing to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Honestly, it's incredibly frustrating when patients don't come prepared. But alright. We’ll proceed as best we can. Let's focus on your general health. Have you been experiencing any current symptoms – anything at all – that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That I can answer. I’ve been… a little more tired lately than usual, I suppose. And my appetite hasn’t been fantastic. Not a huge change, but noticeable. Also… my hands sometimes tremble. Just a slight tremor, especially when I’m nervous. Is that concerning? I hadn’t thought much of it before, but I'm happy you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, decreased appetite, and hand tremors. We’ll look into that. Now, are these tremors constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They definitely come and go. They're worse when I’m stressed, or if I haven’t had enough sleep. I work outdoors, you see, landscaping… so sometimes the weather can exacerbate them too. Cold days, especially. When it's warmer and I’m well-rested, they’re much less noticeable. They're not debilitating, if that makes sense. I can still perform my job, but it's something I've been aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent tremors, exacerbated by stress, cold, and lack of sleep. Right. Now, let's move on to some more general questions. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything. I see a general practitioner, of course, for routine check-ups, but nothing major has ever come up. I haven't been hospitalized or had any significant surgeries before… aside from what I’m here to prepare for, that is. My husband always took care of the health matters, I suppose. He was very diligent. I’m… regrettably less so. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Honestly, this is... challenging. Alright. Family history, then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult question. My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, I believe. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, suffered from… something with her memory. It wasn’t diagnosed as Alzheimer’s, but she became very confused towards the end. My father was quite healthy, actually. Never much illness. I don’t know much beyond that, unfortunately. My family isn’t very forthcoming about health matters. It was always considered… private, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Heart trouble and possible dementia in the family. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I don’t smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m quite healthy in that regard, I believe. I try to maintain a sensible lifestyle, despite my… recent difficulties. I find my work very grounding. It keeps me active and outdoors.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat most foods without issue. I've been fortunate in that regard, I believe. No pollen allergies either, even with my work outdoors. Perhaps a little sensitive to the sun, but that's hardly an allergy. I always wear sunscreen and a hat, just to be cautious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, as you can see, the documentation is… lacking. And you haven’t been particularly forthcoming with details. But, let’s proceed. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics: check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and reflexes. That will give us a better starting point. Please sit here and relax.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, let me know if there's anything specific I should be doing during the examination. I will sit right here.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are… within normal limits, although a little rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated – 135/85. Nothing alarming, but something to monitor. Now, reflexes. Reflexes are… a little diminished, but not significantly. And… your hands are trembling slightly, even at rest. Okay. That completes the basic physical exam.
PATIENT: I see. It’s a little unsettling to hear those findings, but I suppose it’s good to have a clearer picture. The rapid heart rate and tremors… I do get anxious easily, and my blood pressure has always been a little higher during stressful times. Perhaps that’s contributing? I do apologize for not providing more detailed information initially, Doctor. As you can see, it’s been a challenging period. Is there anything else you'd like to check, or any further questions I can answer? I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Honestly, your lack of detail is… frustrating. But alright. Given the tremors, slightly elevated blood pressure, and diminished reflexes, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. We’ll check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. That will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s also possible the tremors could be related to anxiety, as you mentioned, but we need to rule out other causes first. I will also order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. It’s a simple procedure – just some stickers on your chest. And… honestly, given your vague recollection of the upcoming surgery, and the lack of documentation, I recommend a consultation with a psychiatrist. It would be beneficial to assess your overall mental health and ensure you are fully informed and prepared for this procedure. Do you have any objections to those recommendations?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. That… is quite a lot. A psychiatrist… I hadn’t anticipated that. I suppose I understand your concerns, given my… difficulties with recollection. It’s just… rather unsettling to consider. But no, I don’t have any objections, Doctor. If it’s necessary to ensure my wellbeing, I will cooperate. I would appreciate it, perhaps, if you could explain the process of the blood tests and EKG a little more clearly? And could you recommend a psychiatrist?
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood tests are straightforward. A phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It’s usually quick and relatively painless. The EKG involves attaching small sensors to your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. Here are the forms. The lab is located down the hall to your left. And the referral form is for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a psychiatrist I recommend. She’s very thorough. I’m going to write you a prescription for a low dose anti-anxiety medication – lorazepam – to help manage your anxiety while you await the test results and the psychiatrist appointment. It’s just a temporary measure, to provide some relief. It’s important to remember that this is not a long-term solution. Once we have the test results, we can discuss a more comprehensive treatment plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Lorazepam… I’ve heard of it. It sounds… helpful, but also a little concerning. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, but I understand your reasoning. I will trust your judgement, Doctor. Just one question, if you don’t mind. When should I expect to hear back about the test results? And is there anything I should do to prepare for the appointment with Dr. Vance? Should I bring any specific information, or a list of medications I've taken in the past? I want to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: Honestly, you're asking a lot. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days. They will contact you directly with the results. As for Dr. Vance, bring a list of any medications you've taken, even over-the-counter ones. And… try to be honest about your symptoms, your anxieties, and your difficulties with recollection. She will need a clear picture of your overall mental health. Here, I've written down Dr. Vance's phone number and address, just in case. And… honestly, if you experience any significant anxiety or tremors before the appointment, go to the emergency room. It's better to be safe than sorry. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: The emergency room… oh dear. I certainly hope it doesn't come to that. I appreciate the information, Doctor. No, I believe that answers all of my questions for now. I’m… a little overwhelmed, to be honest, but I will do my best to follow your instructions. Thank you for your time and patience, Doctor Osterholm. I will schedule the lab tests and the appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible. And… I will try to remain calm. .
DOCTOR: Alright. See that you do. And please, try to remember more details about this upcoming surgery. It’s important. .
