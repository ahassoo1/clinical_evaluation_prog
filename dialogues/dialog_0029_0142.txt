DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Right. Well, it's… my head. I’ve been getting these headaches. Pretty bad ones, actually. And… sometimes I feel really sweaty when they happen, and my heart races. It’s… hard to explain, it just feels awful. I don’t really… remember when it started, to be honest. It’s been a while, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Headaches, with sweating and a racing heart… that’s good information to start with. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s the tricky part. Honestly? Maybe… six months? A year? It comes and goes, so it’s not like it’s constant. And when it doesn’t happen, I don’t really think about it, you know? I’m terrible with dates, sorry. It's just… they’re getting more frequent, maybe? That’s probably why I’m here now.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent headaches over the past six to twelve months. And when they happen, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Right, the pain… hmm. It's not like a normal headache, like a tension headache. It feels… more intense. Like a really bad pressure, all over my head, but especially behind my eyes, maybe? And sometimes it feels like it’s throbbing. Does that make sense? It’s hard to put into words. It's… really unpleasant. It kind of makes me feel sick, too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, throbbing, behind the eyes, and sometimes nausea. And does anything specifically trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Trigger? Not that I've noticed, really. I mean, I work, you know? It's… physical work, nothing too crazy, but it is… work. I eat, I sleep… normal stuff. I don't think I've done anything different. Stress, maybe? I got divorced a while back, so… there’s been some of that, I suppose. But it doesn't feel like that’s always the cause. I honestly don’t know. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Physical work, a recent divorce… stress is definitely a possibility. And when these headaches happen, how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Ugh, that varies. Sometimes it’s just a few hours, and I can kinda push through it. Other times… it feels like all day. Like, I have to just lie down and try to sleep it off. It's… hard to say exactly. Maybe four to eight hours, if I really had to guess? But like I said, it’s not the same every time. And… I don't really keep track. I just try to get through it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Variable duration, four to eight hours typically, but sometimes shorter. Do you notice anything else happening with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel really tired afterwards. Like, wiped out for the whole day. And… I think I get a little sensitive to light. Like, bright lights bother me when I have one of these. Oh! And… sometimes my vision gets a little… blurry, but that doesn’t always happen. I don’t know if that makes sense. I probably sound like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that's good information, Mr. Lawther. Fatigue, light sensitivity, occasional blurry vision… Okay. Now, have you tried anything to treat these headaches already?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. I mean, I've taken some over-the-counter pain relievers. Like… ibuprofen, paracetamol, that sort of thing. Sometimes it helps a little, but… not really. And I've tried just… resting, drinking water. Nothing really makes a huge difference, to be honest. I figured that’s why I needed to come see someone. It's not just going away.
DOCTOR: Okay. Over-the-counter pain relievers with limited relief. Alright. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I haven’t really been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I mean, I try to stay healthy. Eat okay, try to get enough sleep… I don't have any allergies that I know of. And I’m not on any regular medications. I’m… pretty healthy, generally. I think. That’s why this is so weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions, no allergies, no medications. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was… a long time ago. Nothing serious. No surgeries, no hospital stays, nothing. I… really haven't had much luck with hospitals. Or doctors, really. That's why I'm a bit nervous, I suppose. Sorry. I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, is there a family history of headaches, migraines, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s a tough one. My… my mother had bad headaches sometimes, I think. But she didn’t really talk about it much. And my grandfather… he was a bit… forgetful in his old age, but I don’t know if that counts as a “neurological condition”. I’m not really sure. My family doesn’t really… share medical stuff, if you know what I mean. Sorry, I’m not very helpful. It’s just… not something we talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Possible family history of headaches, but not definitive. Alright. And just to confirm, you said you work physical labor. Can you describe the type of work a bit more, and roughly how many hours a week do you work?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. I work at a… a packaging plant. Mostly lifting boxes, moving things around, that sort of thing. It's not super heavy, but it's… constant. I probably work around 40-45 hours a week. Sometimes more if they need overtime. It’s… pretty straightforward, honestly. Gets tiring, but… it's a job. It doesn’t really involve much thinking, if that makes sense. Just… physical stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. 40-45 hours a week of physical labor. Alright, Mr. Lawther. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological exam, check your reflexes, eye movements, and that sort of thing. It will just help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I… I guess I’m ready. Just… try not to poke me too much. I'm not good with needles. Sorry. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything. I'll try to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No needles today, I promise. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. There you go. It's… a bit cold in here, isn't it? Not that that matters much, I suppose. Just… let me know if it’s going to hurt. I get… a bit nervous with medical stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85. Pulse is 78 and regular. That’s within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take a few deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your eyes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this? Is that okay? I… sometimes my vision gets a bit blurry, like I said, so don’t worry if I’m a bit off. I’m trying my best. It’s just… hard to focus sometimes. It's like looking through a fog, you know? Is that helpful? I'm just rambling again, aren't I? Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, eye movements are normal. No nystagmus. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knee and elbow with this little hammer. Just relax your legs. Knee jerk reflex is 2+ bilaterally. Elbow reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. And finally, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this? Is that hard enough? I… I try to keep in shape with the work, so my strength is pretty good, I think. I haven't really tested it before, though. Just… let me know if it’s too much. I don’t want to break your hand. Sorry. I get a bit worried about… strength, sometimes. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, good strength in both hands, 5/5 bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Lawther, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems neurologically intact, which is good. Based on what you've told me and the exam, your headaches are concerning enough to investigate further. Given the frequency and the associated symptoms of sweating, racing heart, and occasional blurry vision, I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be tension headaches, but given the associated symptoms, we need to rule out other things, like migraines, or even less common causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. And I think it would be wise to get a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any structural problems. What do you think?
PATIENT: Uh… a CT scan? Is that… serious? I don’t really like the sound of that. Blood tests are okay, I guess. But a scan… what are you looking for? I… I don’t really understand all of this. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t… I don’t have much money, Doctor. And will it hurt? I’m just… a bit scared now, to be honest. I just wanted something to make my head stop hurting, not… a scan. I don't know. What's the worst thing it could be? Sorry, I’m probably being silly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be scared, Mr. Lawther. You're not being silly at all. A CT scan is a precaution, to be thorough. It's a quick, painless scan—you'll lie on a table, and the machine takes images of your head. We're looking for anything unusual—bleeding, swelling, or any other structural problems. The main reason I want to do it is to rule things out, and give us peace of mind. Regarding cost, I understand your concern. You mentioned you're uninsured. I'm going to have my staff check the cost of the scan and see if we can find a facility with a lower rate or offer a payment plan. We can also explore some local resources for financial assistance. As for what the worst thing could be, it's unlikely to be anything serious. But it’s important to rule out possibilities, such as a brain tumor or an aneurysm. Those are rare, but we need to be sure. Let’s start with the blood tests, and we’ll take it one step at a time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests first, that sounds… okay. One step at a time, yeah. That makes sense. But please… please make sure they check the cost of the scan. I really can’t afford a huge bill right now. And… if it is something serious… what happens then? Sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions, I know. I just… I need to know. My head’s been hurting for so long, and I’m just… worried. Really worried. Can we at least get the blood tests done first, and then talk about the scan?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lawther. You’re not asking too many questions at all. It’s good to be informed. Let’s definitely start with the blood tests, and we can discuss the scan in more detail after we have those results. My staff will draw your blood right away, and they will also get information on the cost of the CT scan and payment options. If the blood tests show anything concerning, or if the scan reveals anything unusual, we'll discuss your options, which could include referral to a neurologist—a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. We'll go through everything step by step, and I'll make sure you understand all your choices. In the meantime, let me write you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever to help manage your headaches. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief while we investigate the cause. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a stronger pain reliever would be good, yeah. Anything to help with the hurting. And thank you… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not making me feel silly. It’s just… it’s been a long time, and I just want it to stop. I think… I think I’m ready for the blood tests now. Where do I go? And how long will they take? I have to get back to work… eventually. Sorry, I'm probably just rambling again.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Lawther. It's perfectly understandable to be anxious and want to get to the bottom of this. My nurse, Sarah, will take you to the lab right now. It will just involve a quick blood draw—it shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, we'll review them together. It usually takes a couple of days for the results to come back. If anything urgent comes up, we will call you immediately. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Let me go ahead and get Sarah to come get you. "Sarah?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I’ll… I’ll try to rest. And I will call if… if anything happens. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. That’s all. Just… nothing serious.
DOCTOR: We'll take it one step at a time, Mr. Lawther. We'll get to the bottom of this. Sarah will be right with you.
