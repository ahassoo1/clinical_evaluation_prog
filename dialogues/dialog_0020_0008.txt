DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, hello Doctor. It's... well, my ear. It feels full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Been that way for… a little while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness in your ear. I understand. And you said "a little while now"... can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Maybe… a couple of weeks? Or was it a month? It's hard to say. It didn't come on suddenly, it just sort of… gradually got worse, I suppose. I don’t really remember doing anything to cause it, if that makes sense. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it’s common to have trouble pinpointing the exact start date. So, it developed gradually over a couple of weeks or a month, without any specific injury or event that you recall. And is it just the feeling of fullness, or are you experiencing any pain, discharge, hearing loss, or dizziness along with it?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And… no, nothing coming out of it. Hearing… well, everything sounds a bit muffled, yes. Not completely gone, but… quieter. And no dizziness. No, I haven’t felt dizzy at all. Honestly, if it wasn’t for the muffling, I might not even have bothered coming in. But it's getting a bit annoying trying to hear people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, no discharge, no dizziness, just a gradual onset of fullness and muffled hearing in one ear, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Just… muffled. And full. It’s mostly just… a nuisance, really. I'd like to get it sorted if possible, though. It’s making things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to take a look at your ear to see what might be going on. Do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I don't think so. I haven't really had any problems with anything before… but I haven’t had much need for medication lately, so… I honestly couldn’t say for sure. No latex allergies, though, I don’t think. I don't recall any problems with gloves or anything like that. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, no, nothing regularly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. And… occasionally a painkiller for my knees, if they're really bothering me, but that's just ibuprofen, and it’s not often. That's all, I think. Really, just the ibuprofen now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen for knee pain. And no other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my knees are a bit bad, as I said. Arthritis, the doctor told me. And… My wife… she passed away a few years back. That’s… not a medical condition, is it? It’s just… I get tired easily, sometimes. But I put that down to… well, everything. I don’t know. Nothing the doctors ever really focused on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. It's helpful to have a complete picture. So, arthritis in your knees, and you experience some fatigue. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Okay. Let’s take a look at your ear now. I'm going to use an otoscope, it has a light on the end to help me see inside. It doesn’t hurt, but it might be a little uncomfortable if the ear canal is sensitive. I’ll also do a quick tuning fork test, just to assess your hearing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds fine. A light… and a tuning fork. Yes. Just… be quick, if you could? I don't like things taking too long. And… if it’s going to hurt, just tell me. I’d rather know. Everything gets a bit… overwhelming, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay… I see a little bit of cerumen – earwax – but nothing majorly obstructing the canal. The ear drum itself looks a little… dull, and doesn’t move quite as much as it should when I puff air into it. Can you tell me when you can no longer hear the tone?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes… I can hear it. It’s… a ringing, isn’t it? It’s fading now… fading… I think… it’s gone. Just… just gone. It stopped a moment ago. Is that right? It was very quiet, you see. It’s hard to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That test suggests some mild hearing loss in that ear. Given your symptoms – the fullness, muffled hearing, and the dullness of the ear drum – it sounds like you might have a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, possibly due to Eustachian tube dysfunction. It’s not a serious condition, usually, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your hearing. To be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a tympanometry test, which measures how well your middle ear is functioning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fluid… in the middle ear? Eustachian… what did you call it? It sounds complicated. And a… tympano… test. Yes. Look, Doctor, is it something serious? Is it going to need… surgery, or something? I really don't like hospitals, or tests, or… all of this. If it’s not too bad, could we maybe just try something… simple? Like ear drops, or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s not likely to require surgery. The tympanometry test is a quick, painless procedure—it just involves a little puff of air in your ear, similar to what I did during the exam, and it will help us understand what's happening. The most common cause for this is a temporary blockage in the Eustachian tube, which connects your middle ear to the back of your throat. This can happen with a cold or allergies, and sometimes it just resolves on its own. Ear drops might offer some temporary relief, but they won't address the underlying cause. I want to be thorough, just to make sure we don’t miss anything. If the tympanometry confirms fluid in the middle ear, we can discuss options like a decongestant or, if it’s not improving, a referral to an ENT specialist—an ear, nose, and throat doctor—for further evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A specialist… right. More doctors. Alright. Fine. If you think it’s necessary, do the test. Just… just tell me how long it will take, and what it involves. I don't want any surprises. And please, just be as quick as possible. I have… things to do. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The tympanometry test takes just a few minutes. I'll insert a small probe into your ear canal—it doesn't go in very far—and it will measure the movement of your ear drum. You won't feel anything. It’s completely painless. I'll send you with a referral to have the test done at the clinic’s audiology department. They’re very good, and they’ll schedule a time that’s convenient for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. A few minutes. No pain. Alright. Just… get it over with as quickly as possible, please. And then… I can go? I really need to be… somewhere else. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any paperwork? I hate paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go once I've printed the referral. I’ll just need a moment to finalize it. Here you go. This referral has the clinic’s audiology department’s contact information, and the instructions on how to schedule the appointment. I’ve also noted your aversion to paperwork, and I’ll try to minimize that as much as possible. There's no need to fill out any forms before the appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… trying to be quick. And not making me do too much paperwork. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I hope the test provides some answers. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
