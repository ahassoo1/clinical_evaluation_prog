DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it’s… difficult to explain. Words. They don’t come so easy anymore. It’s… frustrating, you understand? Not all the time, but… often.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be very frustrating when you feel like you’re losing your ability to communicate effectively. So, you’re experiencing difficulty finding the right words, or expressing yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… exactly right. Finding the words. It feels like… they are there, just… behind something. Not… gone, but… hard to reach. Sometimes, it’s a name… sometimes just… what I want to say. Do you understand? It’s… recent, mostly. Not… a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. And you said this is relatively recent – how long has this been happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult to say exactly. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It started slowly, I think. At first, I thought I was just… tired. An old man’s brain, you know? But now… it is more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. And it's gradually gotten worse. That's helpful to know. Aside from the difficulty finding words, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. I… I forget things sometimes. Not important things, usually. Just… names of things. Or what I was going to do. Nothing… serious, I don't believe. I’m still able to… manage. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory difficulties as well, like forgetting names or tasks. That’s important information. Are these memory issues happening at the same time as the word-finding difficulties, or do they seem to come and go independently?
PATIENT: Mostly… together, I think. When the words are hard… the remembering is also hard. But… sometimes just one or the other. It’s… not a rule. It’s very… confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unsettling. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as headaches, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with walking or balance?
PATIENT: No… no headaches. My vision… well, it’s not what it was, but that is just… age, I think. And no, no weakness or numbness. I can walk perfectly fine, thank you. Balance is… okay. I still enjoy my garden, you know. Needs good balance for that!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the garden. Okay, no headaches, no vision changes beyond age-related, and no weakness or balance problems. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had a heart problem, some years ago. A… blockage, I believe. They put a… a small tube in. It is… okay now. They said it was fixed. And… my wife… she passed away three years ago. A long illness. Other than that… not much.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been very difficult. And thank you for telling me about the heart blockage and the stent. When was the stent placed, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was… perhaps five years ago? Maybe six. It was… a long time ago. The doctor said it went well. I had to take… pills for a while. I think I still do, but… I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, about five or six years ago. And you’re currently taking medications for your heart. Do you happen to know what those medications are, or do you have a list with you?
PATIENT: Let me see… ah, here. A list. I try to keep it with me, but… sometimes I forget to bring it. It says… Amlodipine. And… something else. Lisinopril, yes. And… a small blue pill. I don't know the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine and Lisinopril. Those are both for blood pressure. And you’re also taking a small blue pill that you don't recognize. Have you noticed any side effects from these medications?
PATIENT: Side effects… hmm. No, not that I am aware of. Perhaps… a little tired sometimes, but that could be… old age. And the weather, you know. This heat… it’s very tiring. I can't say for certain it is the pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known side effects from the medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I eat everything, mostly. My wife… she had allergies, but I never did. No, I don’t think so. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… what does that mean, exactly? I live alone, now, of course. Since my wife passed. I have a… a daughter, who lives in another city. We talk on the phone sometimes. I used to… work, as a compensation specialist. But I am retired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. And very rarely drink alcohol. Just a small glass of wine… with dinner, perhaps… on special occasions. But not often. It doesn't agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your pulse is 72, regular. Your heart sounds are normal – no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs sound clear and open. Your ears are clear. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your eye movements are normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’ll just briefly assess your coordination. That looks good as well. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits for your age. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That all sounds… reassuring. The blood pressure… is that something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good that it's only slightly elevated. It’s not necessarily serious right now, but it's something we need to keep an eye on, as consistently high blood pressure can lead to problems down the line, like heart disease or stroke. Now, based on what you've told me – the difficulty finding words, the memory issues, and the slightly elevated blood pressure – I think it would be helpful to get a few tests done. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. What kind of tests, exactly? Will they be… painful?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. We'll start with some blood work to get a baseline assessment of your overall health, check your thyroid function, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. We’ll also do a basic cognitive assessment here in the office, which is just a series of simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. And finally, I’d like to order a brain scan – a CT scan or an MRI – to get a better look at your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities. The blood work is just a simple blood draw. The cognitive assessment is nothing to worry about - it's just a quick series of questions. And the brain scan is painless, although you will need to lie still for about 30-40 minutes. Do you have any concerns about any of those tests?
PATIENT: A brain scan… that sounds a little… worrying. But if you think it is necessary… I suppose. Is there… something you are expecting to find? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried about a brain scan, Sherrell. It's a standard precaution, and we're not necessarily expecting to find anything serious. The reason I'm recommending it is to rule out any possible underlying causes for your symptoms, such as a small stroke, a tumor, or other structural issues. It's important to be thorough and investigate all possibilities, and this is the best way to do that. The vast majority of the time, these scans come back normal. We’re just being cautious and wanting to get a complete picture of your health. Do you have any questions about the scan itself?
PATIENT: No… no questions about the scan, I think. It’s just… the idea of finding something… it’s frightening. When… when can we do these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Sherrell. It's natural to feel anxious about this. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning at the clinic. The cognitive assessment can be done right here today, if you’re willing, it only takes about 15-20 minutes. As for the brain scan, we'll need to schedule that at the imaging center. I’ll have my assistant call and find the earliest appointment, which is usually within a week or so. The results from the blood work usually come back within a day or two, and the cognitive assessment results I’ll have immediately. The brain scan results will take a little longer, usually 2-3 business days. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. Tomorrow for the blood work, and today for the… the thinking test. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and… and your explanation.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Alright, let's go ahead and get started with the cognitive assessment. It’s just a series of simple questions, so don't worry about getting them right or wrong. We’re just trying to get a baseline assessment of your memory and thinking skills. Please, have a seat, and we’ll begin. I’m going to ask you a few questions about your current date, and then we’ll move on to some other tasks. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I suppose so. It’s… a little daunting, but I’ll try my best. Please… go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with something simple. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today’s date… August… … the second? Yes, I believe it is August the second. 2025?
DOCTOR: Correct. And what day of the week is it today?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the day of the week… …is it… Friday? No… Wednesday? I am truly sorry, Doctor. I am… forgetting.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Sherrell. It's okay to not remember. We’re just getting a baseline assessment. Today is Saturday. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: …This city…? Oh. It is… a small town. … I… believe it’s called… Millbrook? Yes, Millbrook. I think.
DOCTOR: That is correct. It is Millbrook. Alright, let’s try a different type of question. I'm going to say three words. I want you to try to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ready. Please say the words. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here are the words: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: … Apple… Table… and… hmm… something… beginning with a P… … Pear? No… Purse? I’m very sorry. It’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. Don't worry about it. We'll move on. Now, I’m going to ask you a simple arithmetic question. What is 10 minus 7?
PATIENT: Ten… minus seven… …Three?
DOCTOR: Correct. Very good. Now, can you tell me who the current President of the United States is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the President… … Mr… Biden? Is it still Mr. Biden? I’m… not sure. It changes so quickly, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct, Mr. Biden is the current President. Okay, Sherrell, that’s enough for the cognitive assessment for now. You did very well, especially given your concerns. Based on this assessment and your reported symptoms, I’m confident we’ve gathered enough information to proceed with the blood work and brain scan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all my questions. Thank you… for your patience. And for not… laughing at me. I am sometimes… embarrassed by my memory.
DOCTOR: There is absolutely no reason to be embarrassed, Sherrell. Memory issues can happen to anyone, and it’s important to get them checked out. That's what I'm here for. My assistant will schedule the blood work and brain scan for you. She will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the scan. Do you have any other concerns before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you again for your time and your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My assistant's name is Emily, she will be happy to assist you. Take care, and have a good weekend. .
