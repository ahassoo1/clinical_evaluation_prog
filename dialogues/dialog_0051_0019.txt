DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me? My wife… she wants… babies. We want babies, yes. But… we old. I think we need… help to make babies? I not remember much, but she say we need check things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It sounds like you and your wife are considering starting a family, and she’d like us to explore your options. It’s wonderful that you’re both thinking about this. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details; that’s what I'm here for. Just to clarify, when you say “check things,” are you referring to seeing if there are any medical reasons preventing you both from having a child?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is right. She say… something about my… seeds? Not good seeds anymore? And her… inside place… maybe too old too? She worry. I worry too, but I not understand all the doctor words. We just want to know if… possible. Is possible to make babies when we… how you say… experienced?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Carlotta. It’s very common to have questions about fertility as we get older. And you’re right to explore those questions. When you say “seeds,” you’re referring to sperm, and when your wife says “inside place,” she's referring to her uterus and ovaries. It’s good you’re both talking about this. To get a better understanding of the situation, let’s start with you. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… aches. Old man aches! But no… no big sickness. Doctor say my heart… okay for my age. And no sugar sickness. I take pills for… water. Make me go pee a lot. Is that… important? My wife take care of the pills, I not remember the name. She very good wife.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Carlotta. "Aches" are common, and it's good to hear your heart is doing well for your age. The pills for “water” – that sounds like a medication for your prostate, which is common as men get older. It can affect fertility, so it’s good you mentioned that. Do you happen to know the name of that medication, even approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I really do not know the name. She keep them in the kitchen… in the blue bottle? Maybe? I not good with remembering names. She does everything. I just… exist. But she can tell you, Doctor. She very good with all these things. Maybe she come with me next time? She explain everything better.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s very common for one partner to manage the medications. And it sounds like your wife is a wonderful advocate for your health – having her here would be very helpful. We can definitely schedule a follow-up appointment for both of you. For now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Long time ago… when I was young man… I break my leg. Football. Very bad break. They fix it with… metal? And… I think I have… piles? She fix them. Not surgery, maybe… cream? I not remember much about that either. Very embarrassing thing to talk about.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Carlotta. No need to feel embarrassed; these things are quite common. The metal in your leg is good to know, and the “piles” – that’s hemorrhoids – and the cream are helpful information as well. Now, has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. My father… he had… heart trouble. Very bad. He die young. My mother… she live long life. Very strong woman. She die in her sleep, very old. I have… many brothers and sisters. They all live far away. I not see them much. I think… one sister had trouble with… babies? She not have any. But I not remember the details. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Carlotta. Your father’s heart trouble is important to know, and it’s good to hear your mother lived a long life. Your sister’s difficulty with having children is also relevant. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoke. Bad for the lungs, you know? My wife… she tell me. Alcohol… I drink little bit sometimes. With dinner. Red wine. Not every night. Maybe two, three times a week? Small glass. Nothing much. I not big drinker.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Carlotta. Occasional, moderate alcohol consumption is generally not a concern. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I think… bees? When I was small boy, I get sting by bee. Very bad. My face get puffy. But I not get sting by bee in many years. Other than that… no, I not think so. I eat everything. My wife cook everything. She very good cook.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Carlotta. A bee sting allergy is important information. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, that gives me a good starting point. Now, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? Old man bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds… reasonably normal for your age. A little bit of… expected age-related changes, but nothing concerning at this time. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, 148/92. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is regular at 78. Next, I'll take a quick look at your abdomen. Soft, no tenderness. Finally, I'll do a quick examination of your genitals to check for any abnormalities. This is an important part of assessing male fertility. ... Everything appears normal externally. I do not see anything concerning at this time. Now, to get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your hormone levels, sperm count, and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Hormones… sperm count… I not understand much of this, but I trust you. Just… tell me if something is wrong, okay? And… tell my wife. She will understand better. She very smart. Can we schedule appointment for both of us next time?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for both you and your wife. She can certainly help us understand the results and discuss the next steps. And I will absolutely explain everything clearly to both of you. The blood tests will assess several things, including your testosterone levels, which is important for sperm production, and a complete blood count to check your overall health. I will also order a semen analysis, which will assess your sperm count, motility , and morphology . I'll give you a lab order now, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. They are located at [mention location]. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or semen analysis?
PATIENT: Semen analysis… that is… the seeds test? I think I understand. And the lab… [mention location]… yes, I think I know where that is. My wife drive me. She very good driver. No, I do not think I have any more questions right now. Just… I hope everything is okay. We really want a baby. Can you tell me… is it possible? Even at our age?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, it is possible. It may be more challenging, and we need to assess your results, but it’s absolutely possible. Many couples successfully conceive later in life with the help of assisted reproductive technologies if needed. I want to be honest with you, the chances decrease with age, but it’s not impossible. We will do everything we can to help you and your wife achieve your goal. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss them thoroughly and develop a plan. I will also provide you with some information about fertility resources and support groups. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you very much for your time and for being so kind. You make me feel… hopeful. We will schedule appointment with my wife. She will be very happy. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. The receptionist will schedule that for you and your wife. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you both soon. .
