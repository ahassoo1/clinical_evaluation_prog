DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. My name is Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Beinborn. It is… pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, I have been noticing things. Little things, mostly. Memory, you understand. It is… concerning, especially with my blood pressure. I want to get it checked, of course, but the memory… it is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus, I understand. Memory concerns and keeping an eye on your blood pressure – both good reasons to be here. It’s good you’re proactive about this. When you say “little things,” can you give me a few examples?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… difficult to explain. Yesterday, I went to the market. I knew what I needed. Milk, bread, eggs… but when I arrived, I could not… recall the specific brand of eggs I purchase. Always the brown ones, but… which farm? It feels… distant, like a dream. And… last week, I forgot a neighbor’s name. We have known each other for ten years! It is… upsetting. I do not like forgetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recent memory issues – trouble recalling specific details like brands, or names of people you’ve known for a while. And it’s upsetting to you, which is completely understandable. It sounds like this is a fairly new development, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, very new. Perhaps… three, maybe four months? It started small, like misplacing keys. But it is… progressing. It does not happen every day, but frequently enough to worry me. My husband… he always said I had a good memory. He would joke I remembered everything he forgot. This is… different. I do not want to become… forgetful. It is a… frightening thought.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venus. It's definitely worth investigating when you notice changes like this, especially when they’re new and causing you worry. We’ll try to get to the bottom of it. Let’s talk a little more broadly. Aside from the memory issues and your blood pressure, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. I sleep… not as well as before. I wake often, and I feel… tired during the day, even after a full night. And sometimes, I feel… a little unsteady when I stand. Not falling, but… a bit wobbly. My appetite is… good, I suppose. I enjoy my cooking. But… no, I do not think there is much else. I live alone now, you see. After my husband… it is quiet. Perhaps that contributes to… feeling things more keenly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some trouble sleeping, daytime fatigue, and occasional unsteadiness when standing. You mentioned living alone now after your husband passed. I’m sorry for your loss. That can certainly contribute to changes in how you feel, and it’s important to acknowledge that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… some years ago now. As for medical history… I had pneumonia, once, many years ago. And… arthritis, in my knees. It is… manageable with medication. My husband… he had diabetes, but I do not. My blood pressure, of course, has been elevated for some time. The doctor… previous doctor… prescribed medication. I take it regularly, as directed. I do not recall… any other significant conditions. I always considered myself… quite healthy, for my age. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pneumonia, arthritis managed with medication, and elevated blood pressure. You've been taking medication for that, which is good. Do you recall the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. I… believe it is a white pill. Small, round. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I do not… recall the specific name. I have many medications. For the arthritis, for my sleep… I have a bag, in the kitchen. I could write it down for you, if you would like. I am sorry, Doctor. I should remember. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venus. Medication names can be difficult to keep track of, especially when you’re taking multiple prescriptions. Don't worry about it at all. We can certainly look it up, or you can bring the bag with you next time and we’ll go through it together. For now, let's move on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… yes. I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. Perhaps twenty years? It was… routine. No complications, as I recall. And… a small surgery on my knee, to repair a torn cartilage. That was more recent, perhaps ten years ago. Again, no… lasting problems. I avoided surgery whenever possible. My husband… he had many surgeries. I always preferred… natural remedies.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gallbladder removal and a knee surgery, both without complications. That’s good to know. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… My mother… she had heart problems. She passed away… when I was young. Perhaps in her sixties. My father… he lived a long life. Healthy, mostly. He had arthritis, like me. My brother… he had diabetes. He passed away… several years ago. As for memory problems… I do not… recall any specific instances of dementia or Alzheimer's in the family. But my grandmother… she was… a little forgetful in her later years. But that is… common, isn’t it? I do not know if it was… serious. It was long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and some forgetfulness in your grandmother. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he smoked for many years, but he quit long ago. I do not drink alcohol, either. Never enjoyed it. And… no, I do not use any… recreational drugs. I am a… simple woman. I enjoy my garden, cooking, reading… quiet things. I always preferred a peaceful life. After my husband… I have even less… inclination for… excitement.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venus. Peaceful sounds lovely. Finally, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I am aware of. Never have. I can eat… most things. I sometimes have… a little trouble digesting… dairy, but it is not… a true allergy. Just… a little discomfort. No… reactions to medications, as far as I know. I have taken… many medications over the years, for various things. Never any… problems. I am fortunate, in that regard. Is that… all of the questions? I would like to… finish, if that is alright. I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the questions for now, Venus. Thank you for being so thorough. Okay, so to summarize: you’re here today because of some recent memory concerns and to monitor your blood pressure. You've also noted some trouble sleeping and occasional unsteadiness. You have a history of pneumonia, arthritis, elevated blood pressure, a gallbladder removal, and a knee surgery. There’s a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and some forgetfulness. You don't smoke, drink, or have any known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Anything you think is… necessary. I want to… understand what is happening. The physical exam… sounds… reasonable. I just… hope it does not take too long. I have a commitment this afternoon. I appreciate you… listening to me. It is… comforting, to talk about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venus. We'll take our time. I’ll do my best to be efficient. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148 over 92, and 150 over 94 on the second reading. That’s higher than we’d like. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Your balance is slightly unsteady, but you’re able to maintain your position. Your coordination is good. Overall, the exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately alarming, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly diminished reflexes warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation… what does that… entail, Doctor? Will I need… tests? I do not… enjoy tests. Is it… serious? I am… a little anxious now. The unsteady balance… is that… from the blood pressure? It is… worrying. I just want to… understand what is happening. Will I need… medication?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Venus, and I want to assure you we’re taking things one step at a time. Yes, I think some blood tests would be helpful to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll check your basic blood count, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin B12 and D levels. We can also run a glucose test to check for diabetes. As for your unsteady balance, it could be related to your blood pressure, but it’s also important to rule out other potential causes. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. I'm also going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And, I think it would be beneficial to get a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out any structural problems. I know that sounds like a lot, but these tests are necessary to get a clear picture of your condition. As for medication, we'll hold off on making any changes until we have the results of the tests. We don't want to prescribe anything without knowing what we're treating. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: So many tests… CT scan… that sounds… serious. Is it… a bad sign? You think… something is wrong with my brain? I do not… I do not understand why so many. The glucose test… I do not eat much sugar. Is it… likely I have diabetes? I am… overwhelmed, Doctor. I just came in for some… memory problems. It feels like… everything is escalating. And what if… what if there is something wrong with my brain? What does that… mean?
DOCTOR: Venus, I understand your overwhelming feeling, and I want to assure you we’re not jumping to any conclusions. It’s important to remember that we’re doing these tests to rule things out and get a comprehensive understanding of what’s going on. The CT scan isn't necessarily a bad sign; it’s a standard procedure for investigating memory problems and unsteadiness. It helps us look for any structural abnormalities in the brain, like small strokes, tumors, or areas of inflammation. It's more about being thorough and covering all bases. Regarding diabetes, we're just running the glucose test as a precaution, as it's a common cause of fatigue and memory problems. It doesn’t mean you definitely have it; it just helps us to rule it out. We’re taking these steps to get a clearer picture of what’s causing your symptoms. Your memory problems and unsteadiness could be caused by many things – high blood pressure, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even just age-related changes. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and develop a treatment plan. Do you want me to explain each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain them. Each one. Beginning with… the CT scan. What does it… involve? Is it… painful? Will I need… contrast? And how long will it take? I am… a little claustrophobic, you see. Small spaces… I do not… I do not like them. And if there is something wrong… what then? I want to… prepare myself. Knowing is… better than not knowing, even if the news is… bad. Please, Doctor. Explain it. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s talk about the CT scan. It stands for Computed Tomography. It’s a type of X-ray that takes detailed images of your brain and other organs. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The scan itself is painless. You won't feel anything at all. It takes just a few minutes, usually around 5-10 minutes. During the scan, you’ll need to lie very still to get clear images. We may need to use a contrast dye, which is injected into a vein in your arm, to help highlight certain structures in your brain. The contrast dye can sometimes cause a warm sensation or a metallic taste in your mouth, but it's generally well-tolerated. We'll ask you about any allergies you have beforehand. You mentioned you're a little claustrophobic. That’s perfectly alright. The machine is open on both ends, and we can offer you medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. We can also talk to the technician beforehand to make sure you’re comfortable. They can explain the process to you and answer any questions you have. As for what happens if there is something wrong, that depends on what we find. If we find a small stroke, for example, we might recommend medication to prevent another one. If we find a tumor, we might recommend further testing, such as an MRI, to get a better understanding of its size and location. We’ll discuss all of your options with you and help you make an informed decision. It's important to remember that we don't know what we'll find yet. The tests are just a way to gather information and get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll be with you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the CT scan specifically?
PATIENT: MRI… is that… different? Is it… louder? And longer? And the contrast dye… is it… necessary? I have… sensitive skin. I react to… everything. And if they find… a tumor… what then? Is it… cancer? I am… getting very frightened now, Doctor. I did not expect this. I just wanted… someone to explain my memory problems. This is… overwhelming. Is there… something I can take? To calm me down? I feel… very anxious. And the technician… will they… explain everything? I do not… I do not want to be alone. This is… too much.
DOCTOR: Venus, it’s completely understandable that you’re frightened and overwhelmed. You came in with a simple concern, and now you’re facing a lot of uncertainty. I apologize if I’ve contributed to that by presenting so many possibilities at once. Let’s slow down. I want you to feel safe and comfortable. First, let’s talk about the MRI. It stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It’s similar to a CT scan in that it takes detailed images of your brain, but it uses magnets and radio waves instead of X-rays. It provides even more detailed images than a CT scan, which is why we might recommend it if we find something on the CT scan. You’re right to ask about it being louder. It is much louder than a CT scan. It makes a series of thumping and buzzing noises. We'll give you earplugs or headphones to help block out the sound. And yes, it’s also longer than a CT scan, usually around 30-60 minutes. Regarding the contrast dye, it’s not always necessary, but it can help us see certain structures more clearly. If we decide to use it, we’ll make sure to use a dye that’s less likely to cause a reaction, and we’ll monitor you closely during the scan. If you have sensitive skin, we'll document that and take extra precautions. As for what happens if we find a tumor, that's a very complex question. Not all tumors are cancerous. Some are benign, meaning they’re not harmful and don’t spread. If we find a tumor, we’ll need to do further testing, such as a biopsy, to determine what type it is and how to treat it. I understand you're feeling very anxious, and I want you to know you're not alone. I can write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you through this. And I can assure you, you won’t be alone during any of these tests. The technician will be right there with you, explaining everything and making sure you’re comfortable. I’m going to schedule you for the CT scan first. We can discuss the results and decide what to do next. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns. Here's my number, and this is a 24/7 crisis hotline if you feel overwhelmed. Do you want to schedule that CT scan now?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Schedule the CT scan. As soon as possible. I just want… to know. I want it over with. And the medication… yes, please. Something… to calm me down. I feel… very frightened. And I… I think I need someone to come with me. I do not want to be… alone. Can I bring… a friend? Or family member? This is… too much. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening. And for the medication. I just… I just want my memory back. And to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venus. We’ll get the CT scan scheduled as soon as possible. There’s an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 am. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes. That is… alright. 10:00 am. And I… I can bring someone? A friend? I do not… I do not feel safe going alone. Please, Doctor. Just… confirm that is alright. I just… I need someone with me. It will… help me to feel calmer. And… thank you. Again. For everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venus. You can absolutely bring a friend or family member with you. It’s always helpful to have someone there for support, and you shouldn’t feel any pressure to go alone. We encourage it, actually. Just let the receptionist know when you arrive, and they’ll make sure your friend is able to stay with you during the scan. I’m writing a prescription for a low-dose anti-anxiety medication called lorazepam. It should help you feel calmer before and during the scan. You can take it as needed, but I recommend taking it an hour before your appointment. Here's the prescription, and a paper with instructions about the CT scan and the medication. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is… all. Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. Truly. You have… been very patient with me. And… kind. I appreciate you… taking the time to explain everything. And for… not dismissing my concerns. I feel… a little better now. Still frightened, but… a little better. I will… call if I have any more questions. And… thank you again. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. It’s my job to listen and help, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and I’ll see you on Tuesday. Don't worry, we will get through this.
