DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just doesn’t… feel right. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. McConnon, that’s very helpful. So, you’ve noticed a change in your appetite and some fullness or distention in your abdomen – your “tummy,” as you put it. And this has been bothering you recently?
PATIENT: Recently… Oh dear… time goes so fast, doesn't it? I think… maybe a few weeks? It’s hard to say exactly. Everything feels a little… blurry these days. It wasn’t sudden, it just… slowly got worse. I just thought it was old age, you know? But it’s starting to bother me a bit more now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact timing of changes, especially over time. And it’s wise to get things checked out, regardless. So, to clarify, this feeling of fullness and decreased appetite has been gradually increasing over the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Slowly. Not boom all at once. If only things were that simple! No, just… little by little. And… sometimes I feel a little tired too. Not all the time, but… more tired than I used to be, doing the same things. Does that make sense? I hope I’m not confusing you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. McConnon. You’re explaining everything very clearly. So, to summarize, we have a gradual decrease in appetite, some abdominal fullness, and increased fatigue. Have you noticed any other changes – perhaps in your bowel habits, any nausea or vomiting, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh my… Weight loss… I haven’t been stepping on the scale much lately, to be honest. I don’t think so, but I couldn’t say for sure. As for… other things… Sometimes… sometimes my tummy feels a little… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly. Just… not happy. And… oh! I do go to the bathroom… less often than I used to. Yes, that's right. Less often. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. McConnon, that’s very helpful. So, we have decreased appetite, abdominal fullness, increased fatigue, a general sense of discomfort in your abdomen, and decreased frequency of bowel movements. Now, have you experienced any blood in your stool or any changes in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh dear. No, no blood. I don't think so. I… I try not to look too closely, if you know what I mean. But no, I haven't seen anything like that. The color… hmm. It seems… normal, I think. Maybe a little… darker? But I haven’t been paying very close attention, to be honest. Everything just feels… off, you know? It’s hard to remember all the details.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. It can be unsettling to think about these things, and it’s perfectly alright if you haven’t been meticulously tracking everything. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago… I had a little trouble with my heart, many years ago. But the doctor fixed it, I think. And… I had a bad fall once, broke my wrist. But that healed, too. I don’t really remember much else. I went to a lot of doctors when I was younger, but… it’s all a bit blurry now. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I’m just an old woman, you know? Things fade.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. You've given me some very helpful information already. Just knowing about the heart trouble and the broken wrist is a good start. Do you recall what specifically was wrong with your heart, or when the treatment occurred?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… the heart. It was a long time ago. The doctor said something about… a fluttering? Like a little bird in my chest. It wasn't dangerous, he said, but it needed fixing. I think I had… a procedure. They put something inside me. A… a wire, maybe? And I had to take pills for a long time after that. That was… oh, many, many years ago. I was still living in Russia then. It was a different life. I don’t remember the exact year, I’m sorry. So long ago…
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. That gives me a better understanding. A procedure to address a fluttering, likely an arrhythmia, and subsequent medication. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh… let me see. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. I used to take pills for my blood pressure, I think. But the doctor said I didn’t need them anymore. That was… a while ago, too. I stopped taking them, and I don't remember when. I just have a little trouble remembering things, you know? I don’t have a good memory for dates or names or… pills. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. McConnon. We'll work through everything. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. My mother… she was always a little frail. She had trouble with her tummy, I think. Lots of aches and pains. And my father… he was a strong man, but he had trouble with his heart when he got older. He… he just got weaker and weaker. He didn't go to the doctor much, though. People didn't go to the doctor as much back then. And… my sister, she had some kind of trouble with… with her insides, I think. Cancer, maybe? But I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago, and things were different then. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just all so blurry now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. Knowing about the family history of gastrointestinal issues, heart disease, and a possible cancer is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh, dear. What do you mean? Do you want to know about my friends? I don’t have many friends left, I’m afraid. Most of them have… gone away. I live alone, in a little apartment. I used to be a sociologist, you know. I studied people and… things. But that was a long time ago. I don’t do much now. I read a little, watch some television… mostly the news. And… I try to go for a little walk sometimes, but I don’t get out much anymore. It’s hard to get around, you know? I don’t have anyone to help me. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. That gives me a good understanding. Now, just one final question about your history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh, let me see… I don't think so. I don’t remember ever being allergic to anything. I used to eat everything! Lots of pickles and… and bread. And… oh, I don’t know. I don't think I have any allergies. But… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, if I use certain soaps. But that’s not a real allergy, is it? Just a little irritation. No, I don't think I have any serious allergies. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I've lived a long life, and I haven't had too many problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. That completes our discussion of your history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few other things. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. You do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My tummy is a little sensitive, you know. And… if anything hurts, I’ll be sure to tell you. Don't worry, I won't be shy. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. McConnon. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds a bit… distant, and there's a slight murmur, which isn't necessarily concerning given your age and history of a heart condition. Your lungs are clear, but you have somewhat diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let's examine your abdomen. Please lie back comfortably. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. I do detect some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. It's not sharp pain, but it is present. And I notice some… fullness. Your abdomen feels somewhat distended, and it’s slightly firm to the touch. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Your pulses are a bit weak, but present in all extremities. Your reflexes are diminished, which is also common at your age. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with some abdominal distension, tenderness, and diminished bowel sounds. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think it would be prudent to order some laboratory tests and an imaging study to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh my… laboratory tests and… imaging? What kind of tests? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles, you know. And… imaging? Is that like… an X-ray? I don’t want to be exposed to too much… radiation. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just want to feel better, you know? I don't want a lot of… fuss. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps some medicine? I’m just an old woman, Doctor. I don’t want a lot of complicated tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon, and I want to assure you that we will proceed at a pace that you are comfortable with. The tests I’m recommending are routine and will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. First, we’ll take a blood sample to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other markers. The blood draw will involve a small prick of the needle, and it shouldn't be too painful. We can use a topical numbing cream if you'd like. The imaging study I’m recommending is an abdominal ultrasound. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it’s a non-invasive procedure. It uses sound waves to create images of your organs, and it will help us assess your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidneys. The purpose of these tests is to rule out any serious underlying conditions, such as a blockage in your intestines, an enlarged organ, or an infection. Based on the results, we can determine the best course of treatment. I want to emphasize that these tests are not necessarily indicating something serious, but they are important to get a definitive diagnosis. We can discuss alternative options if you are particularly uncomfortable with these tests, but I strongly recommend them to ensure your well-being. If we don’t understand what’s going on, it will be difficult to provide you with the appropriate care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: No radiation… that's good. And no… sharp needles? Just a little prick? And it won’t take long? I suppose… I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? I don’t want anything… serious. I just want to feel like myself again. Alright, Doctor. You can do the tests. But please… be gentle. And explain everything to me before you do it, okay? I get confused easily. And… if it hurts, I want to know why. Do you think… do you think it could be something to do with my tummy? Something I ate? Or… just old age?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I will explain everything to you step-by-step, and I will be as gentle as possible. We will proceed at your pace, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. The blood draw will take just a few minutes, and the ultrasound will take about 20-30 minutes. The technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a small probe over your skin to create the images. It shouldn't be painful, but you may feel some pressure. As for the cause of your symptoms, it's difficult to say without the test results. It could be something as simple as a dietary change or a minor infection. However, it's also important to rule out more serious conditions, such as a blockage in your intestines, an enlarged organ, or a gallbladder issue. I will order the tests immediately, and we will schedule them for as soon as possible. Once the results are back, we will discuss them together and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and eating smaller, more frequent meals. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think you explained everything pretty well, Doctor. Just… please don’t leave me alone for too long, okay? I get scared easily. And… if anything goes wrong, I want to know right away. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient. When will I get the results? How long will it take? I just want this to be over with. It's just… getting old is hard, you know? Everything hurts. Everything takes longer. And everything scares me. .
DOCTOR: You are not difficult at all, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious and scared, especially when dealing with health concerns. I will be here for you every step of the way, and I promise to keep you informed and comfortable. I will personally review your test results as soon as they are available, which typically takes 24-48 hours. I will then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. We will go over everything together, and I will answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, or constipation, please call my office immediately. I understand that getting old can be hard, and it’s perfectly alright to feel scared and overwhelmed. I want to assure you that you are not alone, and I will do everything I can to help you feel better. Now, let's get these tests scheduled, and we can get one step closer to understanding what's going on. Would you like me to call the scheduling department now?
