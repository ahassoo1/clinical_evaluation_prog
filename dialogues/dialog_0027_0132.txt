DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Coby. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this heat. Can't stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now? Forget about it. Feel like I'm gonna melt just stepping outside. It's ridiculous. And it's not like I've gotten softer – I'm still doing the same work, painting houses and fixin' things. Just…can't handle the heat like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a particularly brutal summer, even for those of us used to warmer weather. And you’re right, it’s good you recognize a change. Just to clarify, when did you start noticing this difficulty with the heat?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. It wasn't sudden, not like I woke up one day unable to handle it. Probably started…oh, maybe two, three summers ago? Getting worse each year, though. Last summer was bad, but this year? This year's a whole new level of awful. It's not just feelin' warm, it's like…my body just rejects the sun. Does that make sense? I'm not a doctor, I just know what I feel.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Coby. And you don’t need to be a doctor to describe how you’re feeling. “Rejecting the sun” is a very helpful way to put it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this difficulty handling the heat?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been a bit more tired than usual. Not achin' tired, just… drained. And I seem to be thirstier. Always have a water bottle with me now, which I didn't used to. Used to drink when I felt thirsty, now it’s just… constantly sippin'. Oh, and my skin feels…funny sometimes. Not itchy, just…warm. And a little red, I guess. But that could just be the sun, right? I am still out in it, even though I don't like it. Gotta work, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is good information. The increased thirst and fatigue are definitely things we want to look into, especially with the change in your heat tolerance. And the warm, red skin… that's important too. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just check your blood pressure, pulse, and take a look at your skin. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds reasonable. Don't go pokin' around too much, though. I'm a practical man, not a science experiment. Blood pressure and a quick look, fine. But no need to get fancy. I’ve lived a long life without a lot of doctors, and I aim to keep it that way. Just get me back to workin', that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Coby. Just a quick check. I promise. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. Pulse is normal at 78. And I do see some redness on your skin, consistent with sun exposure. No rash, thankfully. I also notice you’re not particularly sweaty, despite the heat. Is that typical for you?
PATIENT: Typical? No, not anymore. Used to sweat buckets, always have. Now… barely a damp patch. That's another thing that's bothered me. Feels…wrong. Like my body’s forgotten how to cool itself down. I always figured a good sweat was a sign you were workin' hard, now I'm barely breakin' a sheen. And 142... is that bad? My dad always said high blood pressure was a sign of a strong personality. He lived to be 95, stubborn old goat he was.
DOCTOR: Well, your dad certainly sounds like a character! And while a strong personality is a good thing, elevated blood pressure can be a sign of other things, and it's something we should pay attention to. It's not an immediate emergency, but it’s worth investigating. Given your symptoms—the decreased sweating, increased thirst, fatigue, difficulty handling heat, and now the slightly elevated blood pressure—I'm thinking we should run a few basic blood tests. Just to rule out dehydration and check your electrolytes. And perhaps an EKG to get a baseline reading of your heart. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I take a painkiller now and then for my knees, but that’s it. Ibuprofen, I think. Nothing fancy. And contrast dyes... what are those for? I've never had any of that done. I try to stay away from all that medical stuff if I can. Seems like they just want to find somethin' wrong so they can sell me more pills. But if it’s just blood work, alright. I can handle a little blood draw. As long as it doesn't take all day. I've got a roof to fix on Elm Street.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Coby. We're just trying to be thorough. Contrast dyes are used in imaging tests, like X-rays or scans, but we're not talking about those right now. Just blood work. It should only take a few minutes, and the lab is right down the hall. I'll order the tests now. We'll check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and do a complete blood count. That will give us a better understanding of what's going on. While we wait for the results, I recommend you limit your exposure to the sun as much as possible, stay well-hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day. I’ll have the results back within a day or two. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Seems reasonable enough. Limit the sun… easier said than done, but I can try. And I’ll drink more water. Just don't expect me to sit around doin' nothin' all day. A man's gotta work. A day or two for the results? Fine. Just call me, don’t expect me to be glued to the phone. I’m usually on a rooftop somewhere. And doc? No fancy talk when you explain those results. Just tell me what’s wrong, and what I need to do about it. Straight and simple. That’s all I ask.
