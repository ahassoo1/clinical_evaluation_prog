DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising. I’m on that… you know, the blood thinner. Warfarin, I think it is? Anyway, I’ve been getting bruises lately, just from bumping into things. It’s… concerning. I haven’t fallen or anything. Just little things, and wham, a bruise pops up. It wasn’t like this before.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. We'll get to the bottom of this. It is concerning when the bruising changes. And you say this is a new development?
PATIENT: Yes, relatively new. Maybe the last… three, four weeks? It wasn’t a sudden thing, but definitely more noticeable. I'm usually pretty careful, you understand. I don’t go around smashing myself into walls. I just… noticed it happening more and more easily. It’s frustrating, frankly. I don’t want to end up with black and blue marks all over.
DOCTOR: Frustrating is a good word for it. Okay, let’s try to pinpoint a few things. Can you describe the bruises?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… bruises. You know, purple-ish, sometimes a bit reddish at first. They aren’t huge, but they’re… substantial. They ache a bit when I touch them, and they seem to take longer to go away than they used to. It’s not like a little knock and then it fades in a few days. This lingers. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pathologist. I see what happens inside the body all the time. I know a bruise when I see one, and these aren't normal for someone on warfarin, even with a little bump.
DOCTOR: A pathologist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. For… well, a long time. I’ve seen plenty of internal bleeding and clotting issues in my career, believe me. It’s precisely because I know what I’m looking at that I'm concerned. It’s not just old age, Doctor. I keep myself fit, I eat well… this feels like something’s off with the medication or… something else. I need to figure this out. I don't want to risk a serious bleed.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your expertise is… noted. We will investigate. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. I see here you’re on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Afib. Diagnosed about five years ago. It’s been… manageable, generally. The warfarin has kept things in check. Until this bruising, of course. I’ve been seeing Dr. Hernandez for my cardiology, and he’s the one who prescribed it originally. He's a good doctor, but he's busy. Very busy. I thought I’d come here, to get another opinion on this specific issue. Sometimes… a fresh pair of eyes is what you need.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you had any changes in other medications, supplements, or even your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin, but I’ve been taking that for years. And I take a statin, as Dr. Hernandez prescribed. No new prescriptions, no herbal remedies… I haven't changed my diet drastically. Maybe a little more fruit this summer, but nothing significant. I've been trying to eat healthier, but it's not like I've suddenly started drinking prune juice or something. I am careful about my vitamin K intake, knowing it affects the warfarin, of course. I haven’t been reckless with that.
DOCTOR: Good. That's… good. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. I want to see these bruises for myself and check for any other signs. Please lie down on the exam table.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I am a pathologist. I know what a bruise looks like, and I assure you, they aren't alarming enough to require a full examination. But, fine. If you insist. Just please be gentle, alright? I don't need any more bruises from this visit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just routine. Now, I see a couple of ecchymoses here on your left forearm. Approximately 2cm in diameter, slightly tender to palpation. And another on your right shin… similar size, also tender. No signs of edema or warmth. Do you experience any pain or discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, those are the ones I was talking about. And yes, they are tender. As you can clearly see. Honestly, are you going to ask me to list every ache and pain of a 58-year-old man? I have a little stiffness in my knees sometimes, a slight twinge in my back… normal wear and tear. But those bruises are the problem, not a little aching. I want to know why they're appearing so easily now, and if it's something I should be worried about. This feels like a waste of time, describing obvious things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get some blood work ordered. I'll order a complete blood count, a PT/INR to check your warfarin levels, and a basic metabolic panel. That should give us a starting point. We'll also check your liver function tests. It's standard procedure, Mr. Farson. Can you come back in two days to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Liver function tests? Is that because you suspect something is wrong with my liver? I haven't been drinking, Doctor. I assure you. And two days? I have obligations. Can't it be done sooner? Honestly, this is taking far too long. But fine, two days. As long as you understand I'm not thrilled about this delay.
DOCTOR: Routine, Mr. Farson. It’s standard. We are being thorough. The lab usually has results back within 48 hours. I'll have my nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause further bruising. And if you experience any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, blood in your stool, anything like that – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Although, frankly, I’m perfectly capable of recognizing unusual bleeding should it occur. I am a pathologist, remember? Fine. Schedule the appointment, then. And please, try not to keep me waiting two days unnecessarily. I have… things to do. I suppose I'll see you then. I trust these tests will be… informative.
DOCTOR: The nurse will take care of the scheduling. Have a good day, Mr. Farson.
PATIENT: Right. "Informative," indeed… Some doctors these days… .
