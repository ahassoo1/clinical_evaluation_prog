DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's… family. My mother, she… she had some bad sickness. And my brother, he got it too. I just want to make sure I don’t get it, you know? Just peace of mind, I guess. It runs in the family.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s certainly wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Could you tell me a little more about what your mother and brother were sick with?
PATIENT: Um… it was… a sickness with the mind. They forgot things. Lots of things. And… they got confused. Doctor said… something about the brain? It got smaller, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember all the fancy words. It was… really hard to watch. They didn’t even know who I was sometimes.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Mr. Schwer. It's understandable you wouldn’t remember all the medical terminology. What your mother and brother experienced sounds like it could have been dementia, a condition involving a decline in cognitive function. To get a better understanding of your situation, and to help determine your risk, I’d like to ask you a few questions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that's good. Yes, yes, ask away. I… I just want to know if I will be like them. That’s all. I don't really understand all this doctor stuff, but I’ll try to answer as best I can.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schwer. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. Let's start with your own medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions yourself, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I think I’m pretty healthy, actually. I had… the flu a few times, maybe. And my back hurts sometimes, old age, you know? But no doctor ever told me I had anything bad. I go to the doctor for my check-ups, like Medicare tells me to. But… nothing serious. I don't take any pills, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. And yes, that does make sense. Not being on any regular medications is helpful information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood! Just the regular things, you know? Broken bone when I was a kid, but they fixed it right up. Nothing… big. I'm a pretty lucky guy, I think. Always been able to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you've been quite fortunate. Let’s talk about your family history a bit more specifically. You mentioned your mother and brother were affected by this illness. Do you know if any other family members – perhaps aunts, uncles, or grandparents – experienced similar memory problems or confusion?
PATIENT: Oh boy… that's… hard to remember. My grandfather on my mother’s side… I think he got… forgetful. But he was old, really old. Everyone said he just got old. And maybe an aunt, but I didn’t see her very much. My mother didn't talk about it much, to be honest. She… didn’t like to talk about sickness. It made her sad. So I don’t really know. It’s… blurry. Sorry. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. Family histories can be difficult to piece together, especially when people don’t talk about these things openly. It sounds like there may be some family history of memory problems, but it’s not entirely clear. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I… I used to work a lot. Sales. Traveling around. Now I’m retired. I live alone. I like to watch TV. And… I try to walk sometimes, when the weather is good. I don’t really… do much else. Simple life, you know? Nothing fancy. I eat… okay, I guess. I like noodles. And dumplings. But… maybe not enough vegetables. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean, Mr. Schwer. Knowing about your daily habits is helpful. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no, never. I don’t like any of that stuff. Bad for you. My mother always said that. And… I don’t need it. I’m fine without it. Never even tried it, really. Just noodles and dumplings. That’s it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schwer. And that brings me to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hm… no, not really. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve tried lots of different foods over the years, traveling with my job. Sometimes my stomach would get upset, but that was just from the different food, I think. Nothing… serious. I haven't been to the hospital for allergies, if that helps. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: You are fortunate, Mr. Schwer. Alright, to help get a better baseline, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. This will just involve a few simple questions and tasks to check your memory and thinking skills. It's not a test to worry about, just a way for me to get a better understanding of your current abilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Um… questions? Like… a quiz? I’m not very good at quizzes. But… okay. If it helps. But please, don’t make me do anything too hard. I just want to know if I'm going to forget things, you know? Not… show me how bad my brain is. Just… simple questions. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. It's absolutely not a test, and I promise to keep the questions very simple. It will take only a few minutes, and the results will help me determine if any further evaluation is needed. We’ll take it slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Uh… the date? Today is… August… the 2nd? I think. Yes, August 2nd. 2025, right? Is that right? I usually know, but… sometimes I get confused. It’s okay if I’m wrong. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Mr. Schwer. August 2nd, 2025. Excellent. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Um… Oh, boy. This is… hard. I think… I think it's… near the big mall? Is that a city? I don't really pay attention to the names of places anymore. I just go where I need to go. Am I doing bad? I always get lost.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Schwer. You are not doing "bad." It’s not a test, remember?
