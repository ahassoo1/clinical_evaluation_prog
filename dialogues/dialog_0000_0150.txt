DOCTOR: Right. Well, Angelle Shteynberg, 51. Here today...for what, exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to explain life stories. I want a baby. A healthy baby. And frankly, at my age, one assumes things…might not be simple. I want to avoid problems. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: "Avoid problems." Yes, well, everyone wants to avoid problems. At 51, you’re correct to be… proactive. But “wanting” a baby doesn’t tell me anything. Have you been trying?
PATIENT: Trying? For a few months. It’s…complicated. My divorce was final just last year. Let’s just say I’m…re-entering the dating pool. And frankly, I don't need a lecture on the biological clock. I’m perfectly aware of the situation. I want to know what tests need doing, and what the chances really are. No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Right. Divorce finalized last year…okay. Let's get down to brass tacks then. First, we need to establish a baseline. I’ll want a full blood panel – complete metabolic, lipid profile, thyroid, and a full female hormone panel. We'll check your rubella immunity, and do a screening for STIs, even if…recent partners are limited. I also want a Pap smear, if you haven't had one recently. And we absolutely need to look at your uterine anatomy, possibly with an ultrasound. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely none. I eat everything. And frankly, I’d prefer to get this over with quickly. All this poking and prodding...Is an ultrasound going to be…invasive? Because if it is, I need to know now. And is this all covered by Medicare? I don't want a surprise bill.
DOCTOR: "Poking and prodding." It's standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. Transvaginal ultrasound – which is what we'd need for detailed imaging of the uterus and ovaries – involves a probe, yes, but it's not "invasive" in the surgical sense. It’s generally well-tolerated. As for Medicare... …yes, the blood work and ultrasound should be covered, but there may be a deductible or co-pay depending on your plan. We’ll have the billing department confirm that for you. Now, have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: No. Never. It was…not a priority in my previous marriage. My ex-husband…wasn’t keen. And I suppose I always assumed I had more time. Is that relevant? Honestly, I just want to know what the likelihood is. A percentage. Don't tell me it's "possible", I need a realistic number. And will this affect the type of…treatment, if needed? I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: "Realistic number." You want a number, alright. Ms. Shteynberg, with no prior pregnancies at 51, and assuming…normal ovarian reserve, your chances of conceiving naturally are…low. Roughly 5-10% per cycle. And that decreases with each passing month. As for treatment…we’d need to see the results of your ovarian reserve testing – specifically your AMH and FSH levels, and the antral follicle count on the ultrasound – to determine if IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies are viable options. Now, regarding your past medical history…any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Nothing major. The usual colds, flu. I had my gallbladder removed ten years ago, but that’s it. And I'm a perfectly healthy weight, as you can see. I exercise regularly – brisk walking, mostly. I don’t smoke. I drink…occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner. I don't do drugs. Are we getting somewhere, or are we just collecting a list of my life choices? I really do have other appointments today.
DOCTOR: "Life choices." It’s called a medical history, Ms. Shteynberg. Relevant information is always helpful. Gallbladder removal ten years ago… good. No smoking…excellent. Occasional wine…acceptable. And brisk walking is commendable. Let's talk family history. Any history of early menopause in your mother or sisters?
PATIENT: Early menopause? No. My mother had children in her late thirties, early forties. She lived to be eighty-five, perfectly healthy. I have one sister, and she’s a few years younger than me and still menstruating regularly. Honestly, I find this questioning rather…patronizing. I’m perfectly aware of my family history. Is this going somewhere, or are you just trying to make me feel old? I'm starting to think I wasted my time coming here.
DOCTOR: “Patronizing.” Ms. Shteynberg, I assure you, my aim isn’t to…offend. Gathering a thorough history is standard medical practice. It’s not a personal judgment. I’m simply trying to assess your individual risk factors. Fine. Let's move on then. What medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a multivitamin. And occasionally ibuprofen for headaches. That’s it. I don’t believe in loading up on pills. Is that what you were hoping for – a long list of health problems and prescriptions? Honestly, I’m starting to regret even mentioning I wanted to try for a baby. This is… exhausting. And I have a luncheon to attend. Can we please wrap this up? Just tell me what tests you need to do, and I’ll get it over with.
DOCTOR: Fine. We'll proceed with the blood work as I outlined: complete metabolic, lipid profile, thyroid, full female hormone panel, rubella immunity, STI screening, and Pap smear. We’ll schedule a transvaginal ultrasound. I'll write the orders now. The lab results will take a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss your options, which may include fertility specialist referral. Do you have any allergies to latex or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Latex? No. Contrast dye? I’ve never had anything injected, so I wouldn’t know. Look, just get the orders written. I really must be going. Can your staff handle the scheduling? And please, try to be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: The orders are here. My staff will contact you to schedule the tests. Do try to arrive promptly. And Ms. Shteynberg…I would strongly advise you to manage your expectations. .
