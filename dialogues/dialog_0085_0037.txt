DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. My… breathing. It makes a whistling sound now. A wheezing, I think my daughter said. It troubles me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling or wheezing sound with your breathing. I understand. And when did you first notice this wheezing, Margret?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe… two, three weeks ago? It was not so bad at first. Just when I walk quickly, you know? But now… it happens even when I am sitting. Not all the time, but more often.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started gradually, two or three weeks ago with exertion, and has slowly gotten worse to the point where you’re noticing it even at rest sometimes. Have you noticed anything else along with the wheezing?
PATIENT: Yes. A little… tired. More tired than usual. And sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. Like a band around it. It goes away, but it is there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased fatigue and a sensation of chest tightness along with the wheezing. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these symptoms – like, does it happen more when you’re around dust, pollen, or certain smells?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. My daughter does the gardening. When she is outside with the flowers… I think it is worse then. When I sit with her on the porch, maybe. But I am not sure. It could be just when I walk with her too, because we walk fast. I don't know. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like it might be worse when your daughter is gardening, but it’s hard to be certain. We’ll explore that further. Now, have you had a cough at all with this wheezing and tightness?
PATIENT: Yes. A small cough. Not much. It is a dry cough. No… nothing coming up. Just a tickle in my throat sometimes, and then I cough. It does not keep me up at night, but it is there. A little.
DOCTOR: Alright, a mild, dry cough along with the wheezing, fatigue and chest tightness. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have been healthy, mostly. My knees bother me sometimes, and I had a little trouble with my heart many years ago, but the doctor said it was okay then. Nothing with my lungs. I don't think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous lung problems diagnosed. And just some knee trouble and past heart concerns that were resolved. Do you recall what the doctor said about your heart, roughly when this was, and what treatment, if any, you received?
PATIENT: Oh… it was a long time ago. Maybe… forty years ago? The doctor said my heart was… beating too fast. Palpitations, he called it. I took some pills for a while, then he said it was better and I stopped the pills. No more trouble with it since then. It was just for a few months.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations managed with medication about 40 years ago, and resolved since. Good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was young. And… a small operation on my hand, many years ago. A little bone problem. But that is all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed and a small hand surgery. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat everything. My daughter asks me all the time to be careful, but I have never had a reaction to anything. Not that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes a little tea for my sleep. But that is not a medicine, really. Just chamomile.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I do not like smoking. My husband smoked, many years ago, but I always told him to go outside. It smells very bad. I do not smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your chart here, and then I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, listen to my lungs. I hope it is nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: I don’t want you to worry just yet, Margret. We’re just gathering information. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… and out… I am hearing some wheezing in your lungs, as you described, particularly when you exhale. Your breathing sounds a little bit labored, and your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. I’d also like to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your heart rate is 88, which is normal, and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. I’m going to palpate your chest to assess for any tenderness or unusual movements. There's no tenderness, and your chest is expanding normally. Based on what you've told me and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you may be experiencing some airway obstruction, likely due to inflammation. This could be a number of things, such as bronchitis, asthma, or even a reaction to an irritant. However, we need to do some further investigation to determine the exact cause. Would you be willing to have a chest X-ray to rule out any other possible causes?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh… that sounds a little… scary. What will it show? Is it dangerous? I do not like too much… poking and prodding. But… if you think it is important, Doctor, I will do it. I want to know what is wrong. But please, explain it to me. What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Margret. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little worried about an X-ray. It’s a very common and safe procedure. We’re not looking for anything dangerous in you, we’re simply taking a picture of your lungs to see what’s going on inside them. Think of it like taking a photograph. It doesn't hurt and it doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. It helps us to rule out things like pneumonia, fluid in your lungs, or other blockages that could be causing your symptoms. It also helps us confirm if it might be something simpler, like bronchitis. The amount of radiation is very small, comparable to the background radiation we’re exposed to every day. We take precautions to minimize your exposure as much as possible. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… pneumonia sounds… bad. And I do not like the idea of fluid in my lungs. If it will help you to know what is wrong, and to make me better, then yes. I will do the X-ray. But… can my daughter come with me? I feel a little nervous on my own.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Margret. Your daughter is more than welcome to come with you. Having someone with you for support is always a good idea. Okay, I’ll have the nurse schedule a chest X-ray for you right away. We'll need to take a brief medical history with the radiology department as well. After the X-ray, we'll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It won’t cure anything, but it should provide some relief while we're waiting for the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An inhaler? Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If it helps me breathe easier, then yes. I am very grateful. And… thank you for letting my daughter come with me. It makes me feel much better. What does this inhaler… do exactly? And how do I use it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. It’s important you feel comfortable. This inhaler contains a medication called albuterol. It works by relaxing the muscles around your airways, which helps them to open up and allows you to breathe more easily. It's like… opening a narrow pipe to let more air through. Here's how you use it: First, remove the cap. Then, shake the inhaler gently. Take a deep breath and exhale completely. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips tightly around it. Press down on the canister while taking a slow, deep breath. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then exhale slowly. Replace the cap after each use. I’ve also given you this instruction sheet with pictures, just in case. It's important to use it as directed. We'll review it again before you leave. We'll start with two puffs every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath. Do you have any questions about how to use the inhaler, or anything else we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Shake it, breathe deep, hold, and then… breathe out. It sounds… simple enough. But what if it does not work? What if I still cannot breathe? And… will it make me feel strange? Or… sleepy? I do not want to feel… dizzy.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Margret. It is simple, but it’s understandable to be worried. Most people find that the inhaler provides relief within a few minutes, but sometimes it takes a little longer. If it doesn't work after a few doses, or if your symptoms get worse, please contact the office immediately. We can adjust the dosage or consider other options. Side effects are uncommon, but some people may experience a slight tremor, nervousness, or a rapid heartbeat. These side effects are usually mild and temporary. Dizziness is rare, but if you do feel dizzy, stop using the inhaler and let me know. The goal is to make you feel more comfortable, and we'll work together to find the best solution for your breathing. Remember, we're here to help. Are you ready to go for the X-ray with your daughter, or is there anything else I can explain before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and patient with me. I am still a little nervous about the X-ray, but I feel better knowing you are here to help. Let’s go with my daughter. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. I'll be right here when you get back from the X-ray, and we’ll discuss the results together. Please, let's get you and your daughter headed that way. The nurse will escort you.
