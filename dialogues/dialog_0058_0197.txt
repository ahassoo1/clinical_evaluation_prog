DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be blunt, I need a card to drive folks around. You know, for ride-sharing. I believe it's called a Commercial Driver Medical Card? I’m 70, and they want me to get checked out first, naturally. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver's license... for ride-sharing. Yes, well, safety is paramount, naturally. Seventy is... a bit older for starting this sort of work, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Age is just a number, Doctor. I’ve been operating heavy machinery most of my life – logging equipment, mostly. It requires good reflexes and a clear head. I’m perfectly capable. I assure you, my driving record is spotless. I just need the piece of paper to prove I’m allowed to do it. Honestly, it's a bit insulting to imply otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand your frustration, Ms. Sciarotta. It’s just that the requirements for a commercial driver’s license are… more thorough than a standard one, given the responsibility. We'll need to go through a comprehensive exam to make sure everything is in order. Have you had a physical recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one last November with my regular doctor, Dr. Yamamoto. Everything was fine then – blood pressure a little high, but managed with medication. He can send over the records if you need them. I'm on Medicare, by the way. I don’t know if that changes anything.
DOCTOR: Medicare… yes, that does complicate things slightly, but it’s manageable. Let me pull up your records from Dr. Yamamoto. Okay, I see them here… November 15th. Blood pressure was slightly elevated, as you mentioned, controlled with lisinopril, 10mg daily. Good. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, that's pretty much it. Just the usual old lady stuff, you know? A little arthritis in my hands, but it doesn’t affect my driving. I take glucosamine for it. Honestly, I’m very healthy for my age. Are we almost done? This chair isn’t very comfortable, and I have a bridge game at two.
DOCTOR: "Old lady stuff" isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Sciarotta. We still need to do a proper exam. It’s not just about you thinking you’re healthy. It's about verifying it for insurance and regulatory purposes. I need to check your vision, hearing, reflexes, and a basic neurological assessment. It'll take about twenty minutes. And honestly, the chair is rather uncomfortable, I agree. Let’s get this over with quickly then. First, let’s start with your vision. Could you read the letters on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get on with it. Um… okay. E… F… P… T… Z… Is that all? I think I need my glasses for the smaller ones. My distance vision isn’t what it used to be. I have a prescription, if you need it.
DOCTOR: Yes, your vision is slightly impaired without correction. We'll need to document that. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, right here in my purse. Here they are. They’re fairly new, got them last year. I really need them for reading, mostly. But I can see perfectly fine when I'm driving with them, believe me.
DOCTOR: Alright, with your glasses on… much better. You can read to the bottom line now. Good. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I need you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see a finger moving into your field of vision from the sides.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I see it… now… over there… and now… on this side. Is that good enough? I'm not very good at these tests, honestly. My attention wanders easily. Is this taking much longer? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Your peripheral vision is… adequate, but slightly constricted. We'll need to document that as well. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to tap your knees and ankles. Please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit startling! It’s not painful, just… surprising. My legs sometimes feel a little… stiff, especially in the morning. But they work just fine when I’m driving, I promise you. This is starting to feel like a complete waste of my time, Doctor. Are you finding anything wrong?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. There's some expected slowing of response time. Now, I need to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. My heart's been perfectly fine for seventy years, Doctor. A little flutter sometimes, but nothing serious. Dr. Yamamoto says it's just age. Is that all you need to listen to? Because if so, I’d really appreciate it if we could wrap this up. I have a very important bridge game to get to. I’m a really good player, you know.
DOCTOR: I do hear a slight murmur, Ms. Sciarotta. It wasn’t noted on Dr. Yamamoto’s records, or at least it wasn’t specifically documented. And your lung sounds are a little diminished on the lower lobes. We need to run a few tests to rule out anything serious before I can clear you for a commercial driver’s license. A chest X-ray and an EKG, at minimum.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? An EKG? Now you’re just trying to scare me! I told you, I feel perfectly fine! Dr. Yamamoto would have said something if there was something wrong. I’m not getting an X-ray and an EKG just for a silly ride-sharing card. This is ridiculous. I think I’d rather just walk. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your health and safety, and the safety of your passengers. A slight murmur and diminished lung sounds require further investigation. I strongly advise you to have these tests done. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for a commercial driver's license without them. I can write you a referral to a cardiologist and arrange the chest X-ray at the clinic. I understand you may want a second opinion. I can provide you with the records from my exam for another physician. .
