DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Um… my… sinuses? They are… bothering me. It’s hard to explain, really. It feels… full. Like pressure. I don’t… remember when it started, exactly. Just… lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, "fullness" and "pressure" in your sinuses. That can be quite uncomfortable. And you said it's been lately… can you try to recall roughly how long "lately" is?
PATIENT: Hmm… Maybe… a week? Or two? It’s hard to say for sure. Time… it goes so fast. It’s not… a sudden thing, not like a cold that came on quick. More… slowly building. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A gradual onset is helpful to know. And is it constant, this pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s worse than others. Like today it’s… noticeable. And when I bend over… …it feels… worse then. A little bit of pain, too. But not… bad pain. Just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with bending, and it fluctuates in intensity. That's good information. Do you have any other symptoms along with the sinus pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… …I think… maybe a little tired? Not… very tired, just… more tired than usual. And… sometimes my nose feels… stuffy. But not always. Is that… important? I don't remember if I have a fever. My husband, he usually checks those things.
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue and nasal stuffiness are definitely relevant. It’s helpful you mention that. It’s alright that you don’t recall a fever—we can check that now if you like. First, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your ears, and palpate your sinuses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I hope it won't take too long, my husband is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Lungs sound clear. Now, let me take a look at your ears… Ears look good. And finally, let's palpate your sinuses. There’s some tenderness to the maxillary sinuses, right here, and a little bit on the frontal sinuses. No significant swelling that I can feel.
PATIENT: Oh… that… yes, that feels… a little bit sore. I don’t usually pay attention to that, you know? I just… feel the pressure. It’s good you checked. Do you… know what’s causing it? Is it… serious? I get worried sometimes. My husband, he says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to worry, and it's good that you came in to get it checked. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds most likely like you have sinusitis – inflammation of the sinuses. The tenderness we felt supports that. It’s often caused by a viral infection, like a common cold, or sometimes allergies. It doesn’t sound serious at this point, but we want to make sure it doesn't develop into something more. Do you have any allergies that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Um… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. We live in the country, so I don’t… come into contact with much. Sometimes… dust, maybe? When I clean. But I don’t… sneeze a lot or anything. My husband, he’s allergic to cats, but I’m not. We don’t have any cats. I hope that makes sense. I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. No known allergies is helpful to know. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I’d like to start with a conservative approach. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the discomfort, and a saline nasal spray to help clear the congestion. Rest and plenty of fluids are also important. We can also try a decongestant, but be careful if you have any other medical conditions or take other medications. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. I try to stay away from medicines if I can. Just… a little something for my blood pressure sometimes, when it gets high. But not… every day. My husband, he handles that. He brings it home. I don’t remember the name, sorry. It’s a little white pill, I think. Does that… matter? I hope I’m not forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: It's alright, it's good to know you take something for your blood pressure occasionally. Knowing what you take, even if it's not regular, is helpful. We'll start with the pain reliever and saline spray for now. Let’s see how you feel in a week. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, please come back and see me. We may need to consider other options, like antibiotics, but we want to avoid those unless absolutely necessary. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that covers everything. You explained it very clearly. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… nice to have someone who doesn’t rush. My husband will be happy to hear we have a plan. I hope that saline spray works. It sounds… simple enough. Is there anything I should be… worried about? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. The saline spray is a good first step. As for things to watch out for… if you develop a high fever, severe headache, vision changes, or any swelling around your eyes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious infection. But otherwise, just focus on rest, fluids, and following the plan we discussed. I’ll print out some instructions for you to take home. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Do you need a work note for your husband?
PATIENT: Oh… no, that’s alright. I don’t work anymore. My husband does all the work now. Thank you, though. That's very kind of you to offer. I think… that’s everything. I’m ready to go, if you are. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. You’ve been a great help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Here are those instructions. Have a good day, and give your husband my best.
