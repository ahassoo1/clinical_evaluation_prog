DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s August 2nd, and I see here you’re 31 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Yes, that’s right, 31. I’ve been noticing a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been…well, a bit concerning, so I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand why you'd want to get that checked out. To start, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…hard to describe. It feels like a firm ball, not very painful, mostly just a dull ache if I press on it. I first noticed it maybe a month or so ago, and it doesn’t seem to be getting much bigger, but it hasn't gone away either. It’s…roughly the size of a golf ball, I’d say. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A golf ball size, firm, dull ache with pressure – that gives me a starting point. And you’ve noticed it for about a month, hasn’t changed significantly in size. Is it located more towards the left side, right side, or center of your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I think…slightly to the left, yes, definitely more on the left side. Not drastically, but if I had to pinpoint it, that’s where it is. It’s not right on the surface, either. You have to press in a little to feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly to the left, and you have to press to feel it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s been…strange about it. No pain, no fever, no changes in my…bathroom habits, if you know what I mean. Just the lump. I haven’t felt any more tired than usual, either. Honestly, if it wasn’t for feeling it, I wouldn't even know it was there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other associated symptoms – that’s good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history a little bit. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it. No chronic illnesses, no serious injuries. I generally consider myself pretty healthy. My wife keeps telling me I work too hard, but… that’s a different story. I have Medicare, through…well, that’s probably all you need to know. I’ve been married for five years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a teenager, otherwise generally healthy. And you have Medicare. Good to know. Now, just to be thorough, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had…high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather, on her side, had diabetes. Nothing else that I'm aware of, really. My father's side of the family, I don't know much about, to be honest. We weren’t very close. They live overseas, and we haven't seen them in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your grandfather. And limited knowledge of your father’s family medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past. I take vitamins occasionally, but nothing regularly. I can eat anything, no food allergies. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, occasional vitamins. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I usually just try to rest when I’m not feeling well. My wife worries about that too, she says I should take something for even a headache. But I generally just drink some water and lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Thank you for that information, Amy. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please lie down on the exam table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently feel around to get a better sense of the lump. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm listening for any unusual sounds right now. Does that feel alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that feels fine. No discomfort at all. It’s…a little cold, maybe, but that's alright. Just listening, you said? Okay, I understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. I’m feeling for the lump you described. Hmm... I can feel a firm, approximately golf-ball sized mass on your left lower abdomen. It doesn't feel particularly tender to the touch, but it’s definitely there. It seems to be somewhat mobile, meaning it moves when I press on it. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little…pressure, maybe, but not pain. It feels like…exactly what I was describing. It’s…a little strange, but not unpleasant. It does move when you press on it, yes. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just pressure, and it’s mobile. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to check for any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin area. This is just a standard part of the exam when we find a mass. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need to figure out what’s going on. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm not feeling any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin area. That’s a good sign. Okay, Amy, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, the lump feels like it could be a few things. It’s not causing you any pain, it's mobile, and there are no enlarged lymph nodes. However, to be sure, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Tests are a good idea. I would like to know what's going on, for peace of mind if nothing else. What kind of tests are you thinking?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection. I’d also like to order an abdominal ultrasound. That will give us a better image of the lump and help us determine what it is. Are you able to schedule that quickly?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I have a fairly flexible schedule. An ultrasound sounds good. CBC too, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. For the CBC, you don’t need to do anything special. You can eat and drink as normal. For the ultrasound, you usually don't need to fast, but the radiology department will confirm that when they schedule you. I’ll have the nurse print out the orders for you and give you the contact information for the lab and radiology. It's possible the ultrasound may require a full bladder, so they'll likely give you instructions on how much to drink before your appointment. While we wait for the results, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or what to expect?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, thank you. CBC is straightforward, and you’ve explained the ultrasound well. I’ll pay attention to those symptoms you mentioned, and I’ll contact the clinic if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get these tests scheduled, and we’ll review the results together as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. It’s often something benign. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I don't need a work note. I can manage my schedule. I really appreciate you saying not to worry too much, Doctor. It helps. I'll contact the clinic if anything changes, and I’ll wait for them to schedule the tests. Thank you again for your time and your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
