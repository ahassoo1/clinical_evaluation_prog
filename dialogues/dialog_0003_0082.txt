DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor, yeah? Look, I don’t have much time. Just need what I need for… the trip. It’s important.
DOCTOR: A trip?
PATIENT: Yeah, a trip. To… uh… somewhere. Hot place. Lots of… bugs, I think. My wife… she liked hot places. She always planned these things. I’m just… going. Need shots, right? For bugs? And… stuff.
DOCTOR: “Shots,” as you put it, require a bit more specificity, Mr. Tayar. We don’t simply administer vaccines haphazardly. To determine the appropriate immunizations – and whether they are even necessary – I need to understand where this “hot place” is. Do you have a destination?
PATIENT: Destination? Um… I don’t really… remember the name. It was… far away. She booked everything. I just… followed. Lots of palm trees, I think. And… spicy food. Is that important? It was… Nepal, maybe? No… not Nepal. Somewhere else. A long flight.
DOCTOR: A long flight… palm trees… spicy food. This is… less than ideal. Do you recall anything specific about the country?
PATIENT: Specific? Like… what kind of specific? It had… markets. Busy markets. Lots of people selling things. And… temples. Gold temples. She liked gold. Look, this is frustrating. I just need to know what I need to take so I don’t get… sick. I’m not good with remembering names of places. She always did all that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, “not getting sick” requires information. We are attempting to ascertain potential exposures to… well, things that cause illness. “Busy markets” and “gold temples” are not medical indicators. Do you have any travel documentation?
PATIENT: Documentation? Like… my passport? Here. Maybe this will help. It’s got stamps. She… she liked getting stamps. It’s a bit messy, sorry. I don’t really pay attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Ah. Thailand. Several entries over the past year. And… a recent departure for… Thailand again, just last week. Thailand. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Thailand? Yeah… that sounds right. Thailand. She liked the beaches. And the… floating markets. Is that where I need shots for? The markets? Look, I just want to make sure I don’t get… something bad. She… she didn’t want me to travel alone. She’d be mad if I got sick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Thailand. Given your recent travel history, we need to consider several possibilities. We'll focus on the common concerns for that region. Do you have any current symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… a cold? No. Just… tired. A bit sad, if you have to know. She… it’s been hard. But no fever or anything. Just… normal tired. And maybe a little hungry. Is being hungry a symptom?
DOCTOR: “Normal tired” and “a little hungry” are not typically cause for alarm. However, given your travel, we must be thorough. Have you experienced any diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or skin rash?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little… tummy rumble. But I ate some street food. Spicy street food. Probably that. No rash. Just… the tummy rumble. It went away. Mostly. Look, is this going to take long? I have… things to do. She wouldn’t like me being gone too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination. We'll check your temperature, blood pressure, and listen to your lungs. This is standard procedure. Please, sit back and try to relax. It will be faster if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. It's… important. She… she'd want me to be careful.
DOCTOR: Lungs clear. Pulse is… within normal limits. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. No visible signs of rash. Blood pressure is 120/80. So far, unremarkable. Now, have you had any recent insect bites?
PATIENT: Insect bites? Um… maybe. I don't really pay attention to those things. Itchy ones, probably. Lots of mosquitoes in Thailand, right? She always put that… spray on. The smelly spray. I think I got a few bites, yeah. On my… legs, maybe. Or arms. I don’t remember exactly. They stopped itching. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Given your history and examination, I recommend a booster dose of Tdap, and a Hepatitis A vaccination. We'll also prescribe a broad-spectrum insect repellent. Additionally, I suggest you monitor yourself for any fever, muscle aches, or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms. I'll have the nurse draw up the vaccinations, and provide you with detailed instructions.
PATIENT: Instructions? What kind of instructions? And what about malaria? Does Thailand have malaria? She… she always took those pills. The little white pills. Do I need those pills too? I just want to be sure. Really sure.
DOCTOR: Thailand can have malaria, depending on the region. Given your… imprecise recollection of your itinerary, I recommend a consultation with an infectious disease specialist. They can assess your specific risk factors and prescribe the appropriate prophylactic medication. I will generate a referral. And yes, I will provide you with detailed instructions regarding the vaccinations, potential side effects, and post-vaccination care. Now, do you have any further questions, or may we proceed?
PATIENT: Infectious disease specialist? Another doctor? Look, I just want to get this done. She… she wouldn’t want me running around to a bunch of doctors. Can’t you just… tell me what pills to take? She always knew what pills to take. I just want to go. And I want to be safe. Really safe. Is there a pill for everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your… frustration. However, I cannot responsibly prescribe medication without a thorough risk assessment. Your vague recollections and imprecise itinerary make that impossible. A specialist is necessary. I will reiterate the urgency of this consultation to the specialist. They can determine the most appropriate course of action for your specific situation. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… I don't think so. Maybe… a little itchy when I use that… aftershave. But that’s not really an allergy, right? Just… itchy. She used to buy me the expensive aftershave. The one with the sandalwood smell. No real allergies. Just… itchy sometimes. She’d always say I had sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. The nurse will be in shortly with the vaccination and a list of instructions. She will also provide you with the referral information for the infectious disease specialist. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or are we finished?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you… I guess. Just… tell the specialist… I want to be really careful. She… she’d be mad if I didn’t. I just want to go home. And then… go. She’d want me to go. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will direct you to the exit. Have a… safe trip. .
