DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur, trying to remember exactly why I made the appointment. Something about my ears, I think? And dizziness… yes, that’s right. It comes and goes. My daughter helped me schedule it, she was worried. I don't always remember things clearly, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. It's quite alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Many patients find it helpful to have a family member assist with scheduling and remembering details. We'll take our time and piece things together. So, you're experiencing dizziness and some issues with your ears. Could you describe the dizziness for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s very kind of you to say. It’s… well, it feels like everything is spinning, sometimes. Not always, just… moments. Like when I stand up too quickly, or turn my head. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. And the ears… they feel blocked, sometimes. And a little… full? It's hard to explain. Is that… normal? My sister had something similar once, a long time ago, but I don’t recall what the doctor said. It was years and years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. The dizziness with standing or turning your head is certainly something we need to investigate. And the feeling of fullness in your ears… that is also relevant. It could be related, or it may be a separate issue. Let’s start with the dizziness. Does anything specifically trigger it, aside from standing or turning?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes it just… happens. I do get a little anxious in crowded places, if that counts? But I don’t know if that causes it, or if it’s just a reaction to the dizziness when it happens. Oh! And loud noises sometimes make me feel a bit off balance, now that I think about it. But again, I don’t know if that’s the dizziness, or just… me. I'm sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. It takes time to pinpoint these things. Anxiety and loud noises can certainly exacerbate dizziness. Let's move on to your ears. You mentioned feeling blocked and full. Is there any pain associated with that?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just… uncomfortable. Like when you’re on an airplane, you know? That pressure? It's a bit like that, but not as bad. It comes and goes, like the dizziness. Sometimes I feel like I can’t quite hear everything. My daughter says I watch the television a bit too loud, but… well, she always says that. But yes, it feels muffled sometimes. And a little bit of ringing, I think. But it’s quiet, so maybe I’m imagining it.
DOCTOR: Alright. The feeling of pressure, muffled hearing, and potential ringing in your ears – these symptoms are all potentially connected. Now, let's delve a little deeper into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything affecting your inner ear?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Honestly, I’ve seen so many doctors over the years, it’s hard to remember. I think I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago? But I was on medication, and it went down, I believe. And… my mother had something with her balance, when she got older, but I don’t recall the name of it. My daughter handles all my medical records now, so she would know better than me, truly. I'm so sorry I can't be more specific. It’s all a bit of a jumble, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's understandable. We’ll get a clearer picture once we have access to your records. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me see… I take a little pill for my arthritis, every morning. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. And… sometimes I take something for my heartburn, but only when I eat something spicy. That’s all I can think of right now. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. It's all a bit confusing, isn't it? I try to keep track, but… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll check your ears, blood pressure, and do a quick balance test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Anything you think is helpful, Doctor. Just be gentle, please? My ears are a bit sensitive sometimes. And… I might wobble a bit during the balance test. You've been very patient with me, thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your ears. Please lean forward slightly. Hmm… slight cerumen impaction in the left ear canal. The tympanic membrane appears normal, but slightly dull. Right ear is clear. Tympanic membrane appears normal. Blood pressure is 148/92. Slightly elevated. Romberg test… positive with slight sway. Tandem gait… unsteady. Requires assistance to maintain balance. Alright. Based on my examination, you have some wax buildup in your left ear, slightly elevated blood pressure, and some balance issues. It’s difficult to assess your balance fully due to the wax, but it appears you have some difficulty maintaining stability. We'll need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Wax and… balance issues? Is it serious, Doctor? I'm not very good with medical things, you see. And the blood pressure… I always forget to take my pills sometimes. Is that why it's high? I do apologize. I try to be good, but… well, I forget. Is there anything I can do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious at this moment, Ms. Mayhugh, but it does require attention. The wax buildup is easily addressed. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to manage. And the balance issues need further investigation to determine the cause. Forgetfulness regarding your medications is understandable, and it can certainly contribute to elevated blood pressure. We can discuss strategies to help you remember, such as pill organizers or setting reminders. First, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to your blood pressure. I also recommend an audiogram – a hearing test – to assess your hearing and rule out any inner ear problems. And finally, I'd like a referral to a neurologist to evaluate your balance issues. This is a standard procedure to rule out any neurological causes. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot. Blood work, hearing tests, a neurologist… It’s a bit overwhelming, Doctor. But if it will help, then yes, I suppose. Anything you think is best. My daughter will want me to do whatever you recommend, I'm sure. She worries a lot. Will it… hurt? I don't like needles, you see. And I get very anxious at hospitals. Is it a long appointment? And… will I need someone to drive me? Oh dear, I’m probably asking too much. I apologize. I just get… flustered easily, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. The blood work involves a simple blood draw – a small needle prick. It’s quick, and the discomfort is minimal. We can have a nurse draw the blood here in the clinic, if that makes you more comfortable. The audiogram is a painless test where you wear headphones and listen to sounds. It will take about 30-45 minutes. As for the neurologist, I will provide you with a referral to a highly-rated specialist in the area. The appointment will likely involve a thorough neurological examination, and may involve some additional tests. I recommend having someone drive you to the neurologist appointment, as they may administer some tests that could impair your ability to drive. I will write out all the necessary orders and referrals for you. We can discuss strategies to manage your anxiety, such as deep breathing exercises or relaxation techniques. I’ll also have the nurse review the medication schedule with you, and discuss options for improving adherence. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Having the nurse review the medications and help with the schedule would be wonderful. And having someone drive me to the neurologist is a very good idea. My daughter can take me, thankfully. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate it very much. I'm still a bit worried, of course, but… I feel a little bit better knowing we have a plan. I suppose I should stop asking so many questions now, shouldn't I? I don't want to take up all your time.
DOCTOR: You're quite welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It's my job to address your concerns and provide you with the best possible care. You haven't been taking up my time at all. It's important to ask questions – especially when you're feeling anxious. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and audiogram. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Here you are. Please let me know if you have any difficulty scheduling the appointments.
