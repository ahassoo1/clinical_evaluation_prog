DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. I’m here because I have trouble breathing when I try to lie flat. It’s been going on for… well, a little while now. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don’t mind. I don't want this dragging on.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. We’ll do our best to figure this out. “Trouble breathing when you lie flat” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… a feeling of being squeezed, almost. In my chest. And I have to… sit up. Quickly. Otherwise, it gets worse. It doesn’t happen every time, mind you. But it’s enough to be worrying. It’s worse at night, usually. When I'm trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing sensation in your chest that improves with sitting up, and it’s more noticeable at night. That’s helpful. Is the squeezing accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my ankles swell a bit. Not terribly, but I do notice it. And… I get tired. More tired than usual, I mean. Though, at my age, what isn’t usual? I suppose it could be just getting old. But this breathing… that's different.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling in your ankles and increased fatigue, along with the breathing difficulty. We definitely want to investigate this further. Before we move on, can you rate your breathing difficulty on a scale of one to ten, with one being no difficulty at all, and ten being the worst you can imagine?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. On a good night, maybe a three or four. When it’s bad… perhaps a seven. It’s not… panic level, you understand. Just… uncomfortable. And frightening. I don't like being short of breath.
DOCTOR: A three to seven, okay. That gives me a better idea. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on a pill for it. I took it for… oh, a good ten years, I think. The doctor took me off it eventually. Said my numbers were good. Other than that… not much. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. That was… unpleasant. But that’s about it, I believe. Do you need a list? I might have something written down.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Maribeth. High blood pressure in the past, treated with medication for ten years, and gallbladder removal. No need for a list right now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid pills if I can. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that’s it. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Though, I do enjoy a good piece of frybread now and then. Don't tell anyone. It's a Zuni tradition, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Maribeth. Frybread is a wonderful tradition. No judgment here! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m not a delicate flower, you know. I’ve lived a long life. And a fairly active one, up until recently. I used to do a lot of weaving. But my hands aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. And you mentioned weaving – that sounds lovely. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. And her sister… she had heart trouble. A weak heart, the doctor said. My father… he lived a long life, very healthy. But his brother… he had something with his lungs. I can’t quite recall what it was. He smoked, you see. A lot. That probably had something to do with it. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting things.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in an aunt, and a lung condition in your uncle who smoked. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean? Do you want to know about my… friends? I don't have many these days. My husband passed away a long time ago. We were married for… oh, forty years. A good man. I mostly keep to myself now. I have a daughter, lives in Albuquerque. I see her when I can. Is that what you’re asking? It’s a bit personal, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I apologize if that felt a bit personal, Maribeth. "Social history" is just a way for me to understand your lifestyle and any potential factors that could be affecting your health. Things like smoking, alcohol use, and your daily activities. You’ve already told me you don't smoke, which is wonderful. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. No, Doctor. I don't drink. Never have. It doesn't agree with me. And frankly, I don't care for it. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if anything. As for daily activities… I mostly stay at home. I read a bit. I watch television. I try to keep busy, but it’s not easy when you're… slowing down. I used to garden, but my knees… well, they aren’t what they used to be. I’m afraid I’m just an old woman now. A quiet one.
DOCTOR: You are not just an old woman, Maribeth. And it sounds like you’ve lived a very full life. Alright, one last question about your history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than the gallbladder removal we discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I recall. A few trips to the emergency room for a broken wrist when I was a child. And… when I gave birth to my daughter, of course. But no serious hospital stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises that come with life, I suppose. Is that all? I'm getting tired of talking about myself. It feels a bit… silly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Maribeth. You’ve given me a lot of very helpful information. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your ankles to assess any swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. I suppose it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be. And try to be quick, if you wouldn't mind. I have a bit of an appointment I need to get to afterwards. Not a critical appointment, but still. I don't like being late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Alright, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds good, regular and strong. Your lungs sound a little… congested, I’m hearing some crackles, especially at the bottom of your lungs. Not alarming, but we'll want to investigate further. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145 over 90. And I'm noticing some slight swelling in your ankles, which you mentioned earlier. Now, let me just feel your abdomen… Your abdomen feels good, soft and non-tender. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I think it's likely we're dealing with some fluid overload, contributing to your breathing difficulty and ankle swelling. Your elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. Would you be willing to get some blood work and a chest x-ray to help confirm this and rule out anything more serious?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help, then yes, please. Blood work and an x-ray. Whatever it takes to get this sorted out. I just want to feel… normal again. And quickly, if possible. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Are these things… painful? The x-ray, I mean. I don't like being in pain.
DOCTOR: No, Maribeth, the x-ray is not painful at all. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few moments while a picture is taken. It’s completely non-invasive. As for the blood work, there will be a small needle prick, but it’s usually very quick and only causes a brief moment of discomfort. I’ll write the orders for both now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain where to go for the x-ray. After we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Blood work and an x-ray. And then… a plan. Good. I like having a plan. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your patience. I know I can be a bit… demanding. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these things? Should I stop eating? Or drinking? Or anything like that? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. And don’t worry about being demanding at all. It's my job to listen and make sure you feel comfortable and informed. As for preparation, no, you don't need to stop eating or drinking. For the blood work, just try to drink plenty of water beforehand – that makes it easier to find a vein. And for the x-ray, you might want to remove any jewelry or metal objects that could interfere with the image, but the technician will let you know if that’s necessary. The nurse will give you more detailed instructions when she comes in. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s… everything. You’ve been very helpful. And… kind. I appreciate it. I just want to get this sorted, as quickly as possible. It’s… unsettling, feeling like you can’t breathe properly. Thank you again. I’ll… wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I understand your concern, and we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better soon. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting.
