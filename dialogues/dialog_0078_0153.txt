DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Solero, is it? Yes, yes… well, it’s about this… clearance thing. For… acting. Or performance, maybe? They just said I needed to get checked out before I… well, before I do anything. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. A lot of forms to fill out, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Krahn. A pre-performance physical, it sounds like. That’s perfectly alright, a lot of paperwork is involved. We'll get through it. To start, could you tell me a little more about the type of performance you’re preparing for?
PATIENT: Performance… hmm. It wasn’t anything strenuous, I don’t think. Mostly just… standing around. Maybe a little walking. I used to be an usher, you see. And sometimes I took tickets. Lobby work, mostly. It’s been a while, though. A long while. I can’t really picture the specifics of this job, though. They just called and said I needed the checkup. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Krahn, thank you. So, primarily stationary work with some walking – that gives me a good starting point. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That’s… difficult. I’ve seen doctors, of course, over the years. The usual check-ups, I suppose. But I don’t really… remember anything specific. No major illnesses, I don’t think. A bad cold now and then. And… well, I had my share of aches and pains from standing all day. But nothing serious. I was divorced a long time ago, if that matters. Does that count as medical history?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krahn, a divorce doesn’t count as medical history, though I appreciate you sharing. It's alright if you don’t remember specifics – we can work with what you do recall. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. I… I honestly don’t think so. Maybe when I was a child? A fever, perhaps? But I don’t have a clear recollection. It was a long, long time ago. I'm really not good with dates or details, you see. My mind just doesn’t hold onto things like that anymore. Is it important to know specifics? Perhaps they have records somewhere?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Krahn, don’t worry about it. It’s common for details to become fuzzy over time. We can certainly try to access records if you’d like, but it often takes time and isn't always successful. Alright. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I might have had some… moles removed when I was younger, but it was very minor. Local anesthetic, I think. Nothing requiring a hospital stay. Are you looking for something in particular? This is all very… thorough. I appreciate it, of course, but it’s a bit overwhelming, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It is thorough, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. We want to ensure you're safe to participate in this performance. A pre-participation physical simply requires a comprehensive overview. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that comes to mind?
PATIENT: Family… That’s a difficult one. My parents… they’re both gone now. A long time ago. They were… healthy enough, I suppose, for their age. My mother had some… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart, but he lived to be a good age. I had a sister, but we weren’t very close. I don’t really know anything about her medical history. I’m really not much help, am I? It’s all so vague. I apologize. Do you want me to just sign something saying I have no known family history? That might be easier.
DOCTOR: You are doing perfectly fine, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly acceptable that details are unclear. We can document “unknown family history,” and that’s a completely valid approach. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not currently. I haven’t needed anything for a long, long time. I used to take something for… well, I can’t remember what it was for. Probably just a pain reliever, for my back. But I stopped taking it years ago. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I prefer a cup of tea, if I'm feeling unwell. Is that alright? Do doctors frown upon tea?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Krahn. I wholeheartedly approve of tea! It’s a perfectly reasonable approach to minor ailments. No medications currently, then?
PATIENT: No, none. Definitely none. Just tea. And… well, sometimes a little rest. I’m glad we got that cleared up. This whole thing has been a bit stressful, to be honest. I just want to get this done and… well, I’m not even sure what I’m doing, to be honest. They just called and said I needed this checkup.
DOCTOR: I understand your stress, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like you’ve been asked to jump through some hoops. Let’s try to make this as smooth as possible. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had any serious reactions to anything. Maybe a little sneezing in the spring, but I think that's just the pollen. I eat most things. I don't remember ever having a food allergy. I wish I was more helpful, Doctor. My mind is just a bit… foggy these days.
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly alright if details are unclear. No known allergies, then?
PATIENT: No, no known allergies. Not that I'm aware of. I've been lucky, I suppose. So… are we almost done? I have a… I think I have an appointment later. Though I can’t quite remember what it is.
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Krahn. Just a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss everything. It won't take long. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relax… This is… good. Just a quick exam, you said? That’s… reassuring. Alright. Whenever you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not concerning at this point, but we’ll document it. Lung sounds are clear. Now, let me check your reflexes… Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon with age. And finally, let’s just take a quick look in your ears. Ears look clear. No signs of infection or wax buildup. Everything seems alright.
PATIENT: Alright… A murmur, you said? And diminished reflexes? That doesn’t sound… good, does it? Is that something I should be worried about? I really don’t remember anything about having heart problems. Or… anything, really. What does this all mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Krahn, let’s not jump to conclusions. A murmur doesn’t always indicate a problem. Many people have innocent heart murmurs that don’t require any treatment. And diminished reflexes are also common with age – it simply means the nerves aren’t transmitting signals as quickly as they once did. However, to be thorough, I would like to order a few tests. An EKG, to get a more detailed look at your heart’s electrical activity, and some basic blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. These will give us a better baseline and help us determine if any further investigation is needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive, probably. I’m not really on a fixed income, but… well, I try to avoid things like that if I can. Is it absolutely necessary? Could I just… sign something saying I’m okay? I really just want to get this cleared up so I can… whatever it is I’m supposed to be doing. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It's perfectly valid to be worried about the cost and complexity of tests. Let me explain the reasoning behind these tests. The EKG is a quick and painless procedure that can detect any abnormalities in your heart rhythm. And the blood work will give us a snapshot of your overall health. While I don’t believe anything is seriously wrong, these tests will simply give us peace of mind and ensure you are safe to participate in this performance. We can discuss options to help with the cost. I can direct you to some low-cost testing facilities in the area, and we can prioritize the most essential tests if needed. I also understand your desire to simply get this cleared up. We can focus on the blood work initially, and postpone the EKG if you prefer. What would you feel most comfortable with?
PATIENT: Blood work… just the blood work? That… that sounds more manageable. Less overwhelming, certainly. And if that’s all that’s absolutely necessary, then… then I suppose I can do that. Can you tell me what it involves? And how long it will take? I have… appointments, you see. I just need to know how much time I need to set aside. And how much it will cost, roughly. Just so I can be prepared.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just the blood work it is, then. That’s a very reasonable approach. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw. A phlebotomist will use a needle to collect a small sample of blood from your arm. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes, including the wait time. The cost will be roughly $150-$200, depending on the specific tests we order. I’ll give you a lab order, and you can go to [Name of Local Lab] – they have a good reputation and offer competitive rates. They will bill you directly. I'll also give you a written summary of our discussion today and the results of your physical exam. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: $150-$200… That’s… not terrible, I suppose. I can probably manage that. [Name of Local Lab], you said? I’ll have to write that down. A few questions, yes. Will I need an appointment at the lab? And… will it hurt? I’m not very good with needles, you see. And… how long will it take to get the results back? I really don't want to delay things unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s best to call [Name of Local Lab] and schedule an appointment. That way, you won't have to wait too long. Their number is [Phone Number]. As for the needle, it’s a quick pinch, and most people don't find it very painful. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and they will do their best to make you comfortable. If you're anxious, you can always look away or close your eyes. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: 2-3 business days… No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and patient. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll just… go to the lab and get this done. And then we’ll see what happens. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day, Mr. Krahn.
