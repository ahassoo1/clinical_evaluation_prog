DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… to be tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that’s a very responsible thing to do. It’s good you’re taking charge of your health. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if that’s alright. This will help me understand your risk factors and ensure we get you the most appropriate care. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, ask away. I’ll answer as best as I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you. To start, have you ever had any previous HIV tests?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t believe so, no. Not that I recall, anyway. It’s been… a long time. I haven’t really been to a doctor regularly, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Many people don’t have regular check-ups. Have you ever received a blood transfusion, or had any medical procedures where needles were used, perhaps outside of a standard medical setting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I've never needed a blood transfusion, and I’ve always been very careful about where I receive medical care. I wouldn’t go to just anyone for a procedure like that. My husband always says I'm too cautious!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Shaub. Caution is a very valuable trait. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your sexual history, and I want to assure you this is a safe space, and everything you tell me is confidential. This information helps us assess your risk. Have you had any sexual contact with men or women?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That’s… a personal question, Doctor. I’ve been married to my husband for forty years, and we’ve been faithful to each other. I haven’t had… relations with anyone else. I hope that answers your question. It’s a little uncomfortable to talk about, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub, and I apologize if that was uncomfortable. It's important for me to ask, even in long-term, monogamous relationships, to rule out any potential risk factors. Sometimes unforeseen circumstances can occur. Have either you or your husband ever shared needles with anyone, for any reason—perhaps for recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. Neither my husband nor I have ever used recreational drugs, or shared needles. That’s… quite a thought! We both believe in living a very clean and healthy life. Is that what you were getting at, Doctor? I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shaub, that was my line of questioning. Thank you for being so open with me. It's good to know. Now, I want to ask about any potential exposures. Have you ever had any accidental needle sticks, perhaps at work or even during a mishap at home?
PATIENT: Well, I am a parking attendant, Doctor. So, no, I haven't had any accidental needle sticks at work, thankfully. And no, nothing like that at home either. I'm quite careful with sharp objects, believe me. It’s part of my job to be aware of such things, even if it's just discarded rubbish.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. That’s very helpful. Just one final question regarding exposures. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or been diagnosed with any other infections that might affect your immune system?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Not that I know of, anyway. I've always been very careful, as I said. And I’ve never experienced any symptoms that would suggest I’d had anything like that. My husband and I are both quite healthy, thankfully. I do worry about getting sick, though. Getting older… you seem to catch everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Based on what you’ve told me, your risk appears to be very low. However, to be absolutely sure, I would recommend getting an HIV test. We can do a simple blood test here in the clinic today. It usually takes about 20 minutes to get the results. Would you like to proceed with the test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That’s why I came in, after all. Twenty minutes is no trouble at all. It will give me peace of mind, if nothing else. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ve just ordered the test. We’ll draw a small amount of blood, just like any other blood test. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to do that. While we wait, I'll take your height and weight, just to get a baseline for your health record. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. I do feel a little nervous, I must admit. But I’m glad to be getting this done. I appreciate your kindness and patience with all my questions. I do tend to worry, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. We'll take things one step at a time. Alright, if you’ll step on the scale for me… and then we can measure your height. Just relax, and we'll get through this together.
PATIENT: Alright. I haven't been weighed in… oh, goodness, decades. I'm probably heavier than I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're 102 pounds, and you mentioned your height is 199 centimeters. That's… roughly 6 feet 6 inches, if I’m converting correctly. Now, let's just measure your height to confirm. Okay, that confirms 199 centimeters. Now, we'll wait for the nurse to draw your blood. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any questions while we wait?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I'm just a little… apprehensive, I suppose. It's silly, isn't it? Getting tested after all these years. But I think it’s good to be proactive, as you said. And I'm glad I came to you. You've been very reassuring. Perhaps I should have done this years ago.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Ms. Shaub. It's admirable that you're taking this step now, and it's never too late to prioritize your health. Many people delay these types of tests for various reasons, and it's commendable that you're doing this for peace of mind. While we wait for the nurse, let me briefly explain the testing process. We'll be looking for antibodies to HIV. It takes the body a little time to develop these antibodies after infection, so a negative test result today doesn't necessarily mean you're completely free of the virus if you were recently exposed. We can discuss repeat testing if needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. So, if I had been exposed very recently, it might not show up on the test today? And we could test again later to be sure? That's… good to know. It's reassuring to know you’ve thought of that. I worry about false negatives, you see. My husband always says I overthink things.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be mindful of that, Ms. Shaub. False negatives are possible, especially with very recent infections, which is why repeat testing is often recommended in certain situations. We'll discuss the best course of action for you based on your risk factors and the results of today's test. Ah, here's the nurse now. She’ll be in shortly to draw your blood. It’s a quick procedure, and she’s very skilled. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I will try. It’s just… needles. I suppose it’s for the best. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little calmer now, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It's perfectly normal to be a little anxious about needles. The nurse will be gentle and efficient. And remember, I’m right here if you need anything. I'll step out for a moment to give you some privacy, but I'll be nearby. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you.
