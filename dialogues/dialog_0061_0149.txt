DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Wynell. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Good morning to you too, dear. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not wanting me to “give up too easily”? Honestly, the nerve. I've lived a long life, and I know what I can and can’t handle. It’s my feet, I suppose. They're just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good of your daughter to be so proactive about your health, though. And you're right, after 83 years, your body has certainly earned some wear and tear! Let’s talk about these feet, then. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with them?
PATIENT: Going on? Well, they hurt, naturally. What do you expect? I've been on them for eighty-three years! Used to be, I could dance all night. Now… well, now just getting to the mailbox is an ordeal. It's mostly this one, though. Feels like there’s a stone in my shoe even when there isn't. A sharp ache, you know? And it swells up something awful. Honestly, these new shoes are just dreadful. They don’t make them like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp ache in your left foot, and it swells up, even with new shoes. And it makes it hard to walk, even to the mailbox. I see. When did you first notice this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, when did I first notice? That’s a question. Seems like… a while now. Months, definitely. Maybe even longer. I don’t keep track of such things. It just sort of… crept up on me. I thought it was just old age at first, which, frankly, it probably is. My ex-husband always said I walked funny, though. Always complaining. A terrible man, that one. Completely irrelevant now, of course. But he had a knack for pointing out my flaws.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradually worsening over several months. And you've noticed swelling as well. Just to clarify, does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Well, standing for too long, naturally. And walking, as I said. Though, what’s the point of feet if you can’t walk? It's a silly question, really. And… warm weather. My feet swell up terribly in the heat. Honestly, these modern summers are just brutal. It wasn't like this when I was a girl. Everything's worse these days. The heat, the shoes, the young people… Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain is worse with standing and walking, and swelling increases in warm weather. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness…? Hmm. Now that’s a good question. I don’t know. I suppose maybe a little… sometimes? It’s hard to say. My circulation isn't what it used to be, you know. My legs get cold easily. And sometimes, my toes just… feel like they’re not quite there. But that could just be age, too. Honestly, everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days. It's all connected, isn't it? Old age and fuzziness.
DOCTOR: Okay, some numbness and tingling, and you've noticed your circulation isn't as good. I understand it can be hard to pinpoint things, especially when things have been developing gradually. Now, I'd like to take a look at your feet, if that's alright. Just a quick physical exam to see what's going on. We'll check for swelling, tenderness, and how well your joints move. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, now see, that’s what my daughter didn’t tell me. You're going to touch my feet? Honestly. Well… I suppose it can't be helped if that's what you have to do. Just be gentle, dear. And don’t poke too hard. I bruise easily. I always have. It's a family trait. Get it over with, then. The sooner you’re done, the sooner I can go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. I’ll let you know what I’m doing as I go. Okay, I’m just feeling around now. Can you tell me if this area is particularly tender?
PATIENT: Ouch! There! Yes, right there! That’s where it hurts the most, dear. See? I told you. Right on the top of my foot, just before my ankle. It feels… bruised, even when it’s not. And now you're pressing on it! Honestly, are you trying to make it worse? It's always been sensitive. Even when I was young, I remember… well, never mind. It’s just always hurt.
DOCTOR: I apologize, I didn't mean to cause any pain. I was just trying to pinpoint the source of the tenderness. I see some slight swelling on the top of your foot, and that area is definitely sensitive to the touch. Your range of motion seems a little limited, especially when you flex your foot downwards. And I notice some mild redness on the skin. Can you tell me if you’ve had any recent injuries to your foot?
PATIENT: Injuries? Heavens, no. I haven't fallen or anything. I’m careful, you know. Well… mostly. I tripped over the rug last month, but I didn’t hurt anything. Just… startled myself, that’s all. No, no injuries. This has just been… developing. Like I said. It's just… old age creeping in, dear. It’s inevitable, isn't it? Everything wears out eventually. Even feet. Honestly, I don't know what you expected. I'm eighty-three years old!
DOCTOR: You're right, it’s important to consider everything that's going on, and your age is definitely a factor. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing arthritis in your foot, possibly aggravated by some swelling and changes in circulation. Now, to get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some X-rays of your foot. That will help us see what’s going on with the bones and joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays?! Oh, now see, that’s just… unnecessary. Honestly, I don’t like those machines. All that radiation. My sister got sick after getting too many X-rays, you know. Terrible, terrible thing. Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong without all the fuss? I've lived eighty-three years without needing X-rays, I think I can manage a few aches and pains without them. I don’t trust those machines, dear. Not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about radiation, and it’s good that you’re thinking about that. Modern X-ray machines use a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis and appropriate treatment usually outweigh the small risk. But I absolutely respect your wishes, Wynell. We can proceed without the X-rays, but that means we might not be able to rule out other potential causes of your pain, such as a stress fracture or other bone issues. In that case, we can try a conservative approach – that would involve rest, ice, compression, and elevation – and see if that helps. We could also consider some supportive footwear and potentially a pain reliever if needed. Would you be comfortable trying that approach first?
PATIENT: Hm. Rest… ice… I suppose I can do that. I do enjoy a good sit-down. And I already have plenty of ice in the freezer. It's not like I'm running marathons, you know. But I don’t want any of those fancy painkillers. Those things just make you feel… fuzzy. And I don't need any more fuzziness in my life. No, just rest and ice. And a comfortable pair of shoes. But if it doesn’t get better, I'm not coming back for any X-rays. Understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. Rest, ice, and comfortable footwear it is. And no painkillers if you’re not comfortable with them. We’ll give it a few weeks and see if that helps. If your pain doesn’t improve or gets worse, we can revisit the X-ray option, but it's completely up to you. Now, regarding footwear, do you have any shoes that you find particularly comfortable, or would you like a recommendation for a supportive pair?
PATIENT: Honestly, all these new shoes are just dreadful. They don’t make them like they used to. I have a few old ones, but they’re… worn. Very worn. My daughter keeps trying to get me to buy new ones, those… athletic shoes. Absolutely hideous. No, I think I'll stick with my old ones for now. Unless you have a recommendation for something… sensible? Something that doesn't look like a spaceship on my feet. Something… supportive, but also… dignified. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Dignity is important! There are some brands that make comfortable walking shoes with a more classic look. New Balance and Brooks both have some options that aren’t as brightly colored or bulky as some athletic shoes. We could also look at some orthopedic sandals with good arch support. They might be more comfortable, especially in the warmer weather. Here are a few examples. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, my… those are… something. No, no, definitely not those bright pink ones. And those… look like clown shoes. Honestly, dear, I’ve seen more sensible footwear on scarecrows. Perhaps… those brown ones, the simpler ones? They don’t look terrible. But I'd have to try them on, of course. I’m not buying anything online. Absolutely not. It’s just so hard to find good shoes these days. Everything is either hideous or uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I agree, finding the right shoes can be a challenge. Those brown ones are a good option, they do look more classic and supportive. There's a shoe store down the street, “Comfort Footwear”, they have a good selection and a knowledgeable staff who can help you find the perfect fit. We can also document that you’ll be trying new shoes, and follow up in a few weeks to see how you’re doing. And just to reiterate, we’ll focus on rest and ice for now. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I suppose not. Rest, ice, sensible shoes… and no X-rays. You’ve got it all covered, dear. Thank you… I think. Honestly, I still think it's just old age, but I appreciate you listening to me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go put my feet up. And maybe find some ice. It's been… an experience. And don’t let your daughter talk you into any pink shoes, dear. It’s a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. And I promise, no pink shoes. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens. And I hope you enjoy resting your feet. .
