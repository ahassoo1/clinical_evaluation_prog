DOCTOR: Right, Jailia Chakka. Eighteen years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pitmon. It’s… rather concerning, truthfully. I’ve been losing weight, and not in a good way. And I’m constantly tired, even after a full night’s rest. It's quite disruptive, and frankly, embarrassing. Furthermore, I’ve been experiencing… night sweats. Profuse ones. It’s most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Losing weight and being tired… it happens. A lot of things can cause that. Night sweats, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite a lot, actually. It’s not just a little dampness, it’s… soaking. I require a change of clothes sometimes. It’s… unhygienic, and my husband is rather particular about cleanliness. It's been ongoing for approximately three weeks now, perhaps a little longer. And the weight loss is… noticeable. I haven't been keeping precise track, but my garments fit rather loosely.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Though, truthfully, I do not understand why that is relevant. Is there a specific cause you are considering, Doctor? I assure you, I maintain a very… disciplined lifestyle. My diet is quite controlled, and I engage in regular physical activity, as one should. It’s rather perplexing that this is occurring despite my efforts.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s good you’re disciplined, but “disciplined” doesn't mean immune to everything. We need to rule things out. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or cough?
PATIENT: A cough? No, Doctor, I have not. And a fever… I have not taken my temperature, truthfully. My husband typically handles such matters. I feel warm at times, but I attribute that to the… night sweats. Chills, no. Just… exhaustion, and the rather unpleasant dampness. It’s hardly a comfortable situation, I assure you. Do you suspect something… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be anything major, but we need to get a better picture. Have you experienced any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, Doctor. My ankles are quite slender, as you can plainly see. I maintain a very… proportionate physique. Though, I confess, I have noticed a slight… discoloration on my shins. A sort of brownish hue. It’s rather faint, but it is there. Is that… relevant? My husband hasn’t commented on it, but he isn’t always observant of such details.
DOCTOR: Brownish discoloration… Interesting. And what about any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? No, Doctor, not precisely. I eat… appropriately. Measured portions of wholesome foods. Though, I confess, my desire for sweets has diminished somewhat. I find the thought of confectionary rather… unappealing now. It’s most unusual. I generally have a rather… refined palate. Do you believe this may be related to the night sweats and weight loss? I find it all rather… distressing. It is interfering with my daily routine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your thyroid. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I find examinations… undignified. But if it is necessary for a proper diagnosis, I shall comply. Is there anything I should be aware of during the examination? And will it… require me to disrobe? I prefer to maintain a degree of modesty, if possible.
DOCTOR: You’ll just need to lie down and I'll listen with my stethoscope. You don't need to disrobe fully, just loosen your clothing a bit. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Chakka. Now, if you could just lie down…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I still maintain a degree of skepticism regarding the necessity of such a procedure. I trust this will be… swift. And painless. I have a rather… important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And there’s some mild pitting edema here. Not significant, but present. Blood pressure is 110/70, pulse 88. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. So, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, slight thyroid enlargement, and some edema… Let’s get some blood work done, just to rule things out. A complete blood count, thyroid panel, and a metabolic panel. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. I have never experienced an allergic reaction. My constitution is… remarkably robust. Though, my husband is slightly sensitive to pollen. Is that relevant? And what precisely does this blood work entail? Will it be… painful? I must confess, I have a rather… low tolerance for discomfort. And how long will it take to receive the results? My schedule is quite demanding, you see.
DOCTOR: Your husband’s allergies are not relevant, Ms. Chakka. The blood work is a standard procedure – a small sample will be drawn from your arm. It might sting for a moment, but it’s not painful. And the results will take about three to five business days. We'll call you when they're in. Now, do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Three to five business days? That is… rather inconvenient. Very well, Doctor. I suppose it cannot be avoided. But I trust your staff is… efficient. And what precisely are we attempting to “rule out” with these tests? Are you suspecting something… serious? I find it rather unsettling to be left in suspense. Perhaps you could offer a… preliminary assessment? I assure you, I am a very… analytical person and appreciate clarity.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Chakka, we're ruling out a range of possibilities – thyroid issues, infection, even some rarer conditions. It's standard protocol. We need to see the results before we can draw any conclusions. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. A lot of people experience these symptoms when they’re under pressure. But we have to be thorough. Let’s get the blood work done, and then we'll talk again when we have the results. A nurse will be in shortly to draw the sample. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Stress? Doctor, with all due respect, my life is meticulously organized and remarkably efficient. Stress is a concept foreign to my existence. However, if you insist on proceeding with these… unnecessary tests, I shall comply. But I expect a detailed explanation of the results, regardless of how… trivial they may be. And if it is merely stress, I trust you will offer some… practical strategies for maintaining my equilibrium. Very well. I shall await the nurse. Do inform her to be… gentle.
DOCTOR: Right. A nurse will be with you shortly. .
