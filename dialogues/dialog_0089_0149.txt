DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Roseburrough, you say? Fancy name. Honestly, I don't quite recall why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted I come. Something about... not wanting them to do things to me? I just want to be left alone, really. I’ve lived a long life, you know. Longer than most.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. It sounds like Elodie is just looking out for you, wanting to make sure you’re feeling your best. Sometimes a check-up is all it takes. No need to worry about anything being done to you without your say-so. Let’s just take things slowly, okay?
PATIENT: Slowly is good. Very good. Honestly, doctors these days... always poking and prodding. My first husband, God rest his soul, he was a carpenter. He understood things. Hands-on. Not all this... machinery. And Elodie worries too much. She always has. A sensitive girl. What exactly are you supposed to be doing today, dear? Just so I’m clear.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Well, today I just want to get a better picture of how you’re feeling overall. We'll talk about your health, any symptoms you might be having—even small ones—and do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything is as it should be. We can skip anything you’re not comfortable with, of course. Let’s start with that overall feeling. Are you having any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Well, my feet ache, naturally. I am a podiatrist, you know. Been on them for… oh, decades. But that’s just old age. It's a dull ache. Nothing to write home about. It’s more of a… weariness, I suppose. And sometimes my knees creak. Like an old door. But I've learned to ignore it. It's just part of getting old. Is that what you want to know, dear? About aches and pains?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Wynell. The feet and knees are good to know, especially with your profession. “Dull ache in bilateral feet, crepitus in knees,” I murmur to myself. When you say weariness, is that mostly physical, or are you feeling tired in other ways, like having trouble with your energy levels or feeling down?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… everything, really. The physical, of course. Carrying patients all those years… it takes a toll. But it’s… a heaviness, too. A feeling like… like I've seen enough. Done enough. You wouldn't understand. You're young. Full of… possibilities. I’ve lived a full life, but it's also a… a long one. It's hard to explain. I just don't have the… the drive anymore.
DOCTOR: I think I do understand, Wynell. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of fatigue, both physical and emotional. That's very common, especially after a long and fulfilling career like yours. It’s okay to feel that way. Let’s talk a little bit more about that emotional weariness. Have you noticed any changes in your mood lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Well, I don't go around jumping for joy, if that's what you mean. Never have. I’m a practical woman. But… sometimes I just feel… a little gray. Not sad, exactly. Just… empty. And I snap at Elodie more than I should. She means well, but she fusses so. Always asking if I'm “taking care of myself”. Honestly, it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, “reports feelings of emotional ‘grayness’, increased irritability, especially with daughter.” It sounds like the fussing is getting to you. It's understandable to feel frustrated when someone is constantly checking in, even if they mean well. Now, have you been sleeping okay?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Oh, that's a… a whole thing. I go to bed, naturally. But I don’t always stay asleep. I wake up… a lot. Thinking about patients, mostly. Old cases. Things I could have done differently. And the house is quiet, you know? Too quiet. And sometimes I just… lie there. Staring at the ceiling. Thinking. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, “reports frequent awakenings, difficulty staying asleep, ruminating thoughts about past patients.” That sounds… restless. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions that might seem a little personal, Wynell, but they can help me understand how you’re feeling overall. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Personal? Oh, dear. I’ve lived a long life, you know. I've had plenty of personal questions. Go ahead. But don’t expect a lot of details. My memory isn't what it used to be. And frankly, some things are best left buried.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. Just answer what you’re comfortable with. First, over the past two weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things you usually enjoy?
PATIENT: Enjoyment? Hmm. Well, I used to like gardening. But the weeds just… overwhelmed me. And I haven’t been to see my friends in ages. Too much effort, you know? Getting there, making conversation... it all seems… pointless, really. So, no. I haven't been enjoying much of anything, I suppose. Not for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the past two weeks, have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless? Oh, dear. That’s a… strong word. I wouldn’t say hopeless. Just… tired. Very, very tired. And… resigned, maybe. Things are what they are. You can't change the past, and the future… well, it doesn't hold much appeal. I've had a good life, you know? But it’s… winding down. Is that what you want to know, dear? If I'm sad? No. Not sad. Just… done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. "Reports feelings of fatigue, resignation, lack of future outlook.” It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot. One more question. Have you had any thoughts of death or hurting yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a rather blunt question, isn’t it? Well… sometimes, when I’m lying awake, I think about… just not waking up. Not because I want to, you understand. Just… a feeling that it wouldn't matter much if I didn't. It’s… a peaceful thought, sometimes. But I wouldn’t do anything. Never. I have Elodie, you know. And… I’ve always been a practical woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Wynell. That took courage. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of difficult emotions, and it’s important to address them. It’s good that you wouldn’t act on those thoughts, but the fact that they’re there at all is something we need to take seriously. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. It’s a common condition, especially after a long and fulfilling life like yours, and it’s very treatable. Would you be open to exploring some options to help you feel better?
PATIENT: Depression? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. I always thought depression was for… younger people. For people who hadn’t lived a full life. I’ve had a good life, you know. A long life. Treatment? What kind of treatment? I don't want any… machinery. And I don’t want to take pills. I’ve never been one for pills. Is there anything else? Something… simpler?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. You're right, depression can affect anyone, regardless of age or life experience. And you’re right to want to explore options that feel comfortable for you. There are several things we can try. We could start with talk therapy – meeting with a counselor to discuss your feelings and develop coping strategies. That doesn't involve any machinery or pills. There are also some lifestyle changes that can make a big difference, like regular exercise – even just a gentle walk – and connecting with friends and family. We could also consider a low dose medication if the other options aren't enough, but we wouldn’t start that unless you’re comfortable with it and after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits. Would you be open to starting with talk therapy?
PATIENT: Talk therapy… hmm. I suppose… it couldn’t hurt. I always was a good listener. Maybe talking to someone, instead of just listening, would be… helpful. But I don't want to go to a strange place. And I don't want to talk about… everything. Some things are best left buried, you know? And who would I be talking to? A young person? I don’t want a young person telling me how to live my life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. We can absolutely find a therapist who’s a good fit for you. I can recommend a few experienced counselors in the area, and we can discuss their backgrounds and specializations. We can also make sure it's someone with a wealth of life experience themselves – not necessarily a young person. We can also discuss what you're comfortable sharing in therapy. You don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. It's a safe space, and the goal is to help you feel better, not to pry into your past. I’ll give you a list of some therapists with their contact information. You can take a look and see if anyone seems like a good fit. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: That… that sounds reasonable, dear. A list… yes. That gives me some control, at least. And someone with… experience. That's important. I suppose… it's worth a try. I’ve always been a practical woman. And I don't want to be a burden to Elodie. She worries so much already. Yes. A list would be good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. I’m glad you’re open to exploring this. I’ll have the receptionist print out a list of therapists for you before you leave. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral for a vitamin D level check. Low vitamin D can sometimes contribute to feelings of fatigue and low mood. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Vitamin D? Oh, dear. Is that something serious? I always liked the sun. But I don't go out much anymore. No… I think that’s all, dear. Just… the list. And maybe… a little peace and quiet. I’m very tired. Thank you for listening. And for not… judging.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. Vitamin D deficiency is very common, and it’s easily treatable. It's definitely worth checking. I’m glad I could listen, and you absolutely weren’t judged. You’ve lived a full life, and it takes courage to ask for help. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw some blood for the vitamin D test. Then I’ll get that list of therapists for you. Take your time getting up, and please don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything. I’ll see you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You’re a kind young woman. .
