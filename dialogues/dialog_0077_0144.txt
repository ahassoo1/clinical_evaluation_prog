DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Well, honestly? I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter, Susan, insisted. Said I should “get checked out.” She worries too much, that one. Just thought I'd humor her, I suppose. A general look-over, maybe? I don't feel sick, not really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always good to be proactive, and daughters often have good instincts. A general check-over is perfectly fine. Perhaps we can start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh, history... That's a long story, dear. My husband, bless his soul, handled all that paperwork. Passed away… oh, it must be… seven years now? Eight? Time just slips away, you know. I vaguely remember having… something with my gallbladder, a long time ago. But that was ages and ages ago. I mostly just try to stay out of trouble, if you catch my drift. Is that helpful? I’m not good with dates and details, I warn you.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. We'll take things slowly. Losing a spouse is difficult, and it’s completely understandable to have trouble recalling details after such a loss. The gallbladder issue is a good start. Do you remember roughly when that was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... Let me think… it was before Susan was married, definitely. She's been married… fifteen years now? Maybe sixteen? So, it must have been… in the nineties? Or early two-thousands? I really haven’t a clue. I just remember being in a lot of pain, and then… it was gone. They… took something out, I think. Honestly, the details are all a blur. Is this going to be a quiz? I'm terrible at those.
DOCTOR: Not a quiz at all, Ms. Calvery. Just trying to get a sense of things. The nineties or early two-thousands is helpful. We can also look at your records, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Records? Oh, I suppose that's fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. Susan always said I have the worst handwriting, so they probably won’t make much sense anyway. Do you think they'll have anything about my arthritis? That's been bothering me a bit lately, especially in my hands. It's just… old age, I suppose. It is what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me see… Yes, I see some notes here regarding cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 2003. And it looks like there is mention of osteoarthritis, diagnosed approximately ten years ago, primarily affecting the hands. It also indicates some mild hypertension, controlled with medication. Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh, hypertension, is that the blood pressure thing? Yes, yes, I take a little pill for that. Every morning. A white one, I think. Or maybe it's a yellow one? They change them sometimes, you know. And… Oh, and something for my water retention. My ankles swell up something awful if I stand too long. A little pink one. I keep them in a pill organizer, Susan got me, but I sometimes forget to fill it. It’s all rather confusing, honestly. I mostly just take what she tells me to. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Not bad at all, Ms. Calvery. It's good you have someone helping you manage things. Let's try to get a more precise list of your medications, just to be sure. Do you happen to know the names of the medications, or can you bring in the pill bottles next time you visit?
PATIENT: Oh, the names… Dear, I wouldn’t have the slightest. Susan handles all that. She keeps a list, I’m sure. I could ask her. Yes, that's a good idea. I'll have to remember to ask her before my next appointment. Honestly, I feel like a child sometimes. Relying on everyone else for everything. It’s just… my brain isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. It’s just one of those things.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to have some memory lapses as we age, Ms. Calvery. And it sounds like you have a very supportive daughter. Now, besides the arthritis and the water retention, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, I get a little tired sometimes. More tired than I used to, anyway. But that could just be the weather, you know? It's been so hot and humid lately. And my vision isn't what it used to be. I have trouble reading the newspaper without my glasses, of course. But I've always needed glasses. Oh! And my balance isn't the best. I nearly fell in the garden last week. Just a little stumble, nothing serious. But it scared me half to death. Does that count as a symptom? I don't want to bother you with silly things.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Ms. Calvery. Fatigue, changes in vision, and the balance issue—all worth investigating. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam… Well, alright, dear. I suppose so. But please be gentle, my bones aren’t what they used to be. And try not to take too long. I have a bridge game later this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late. I’m not very good at bridge, but it gets me out of the house.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We’ll take things very gently. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 140/90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but some mild wheezing on exhale. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh, my... That tickles! Is that normal? I always thought that was supposed to be unpleasant. My reflexes aren’t very strong, are they? Susan always said I was a bit clumsy. Everything feels a bit… wobbly today, if I’m honest. Perhaps it’s just the heat. It really does something to my equilibrium. Is this going to be a long process? I really shouldn't be late for bridge.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. A diminished reflex can be normal with age, or it can indicate other things we'll want to investigate. It’s good we’re checking. Your equilibrium is something we should discuss, and the exam does seem to confirm some weakness. Now, let’s just check your feet… Good circulation, but some decreased sensation in your toes. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… Yes, actually. Sometimes, especially at night, my feet feel a bit… prickly. Like little needles. And they get cold easily. I usually wear thick socks to bed, even in the summer. Susan tells me I should get those special shoes, but I don’t like the way they look. They’re so… orthopedic. I'd rather just be cold, thank you very much. Is that bad? Am I getting old? This is all very concerning, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Not bad at all, Ms. Calvery. The prickly sensation and coldness in your feet, along with the decreased sensation, are important things to note. They could be related to several factors, including peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage. It's good that you mentioned these things. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the exam, I recommend we order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. We’ll also want to consider a nerve conduction study to assess the function of the nerves in your feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Blood tests and… what was that other thing? Nerve something? It sounds rather…invasive. Is it painful? Susan always said I have terrible veins. They bruise so easily. I really don’t like needles. And I have bridge this afternoon! Will this take long? I suppose if it’s important… Alright, doctor. Do what you think is best. Just try to be quick, please. And gentle. And maybe I can reschedule bridge? This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We’ll take every precaution to make it as comfortable as possible. The blood tests are relatively quick, and we'll use a gentle technique. The nerve conduction study does involve some small electrical impulses, but it’s usually well-tolerated, and any discomfort is minimal and temporary. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. We can discuss rescheduling bridge if needed. I'm going to write an order for the blood tests and referral to neurology for the nerve conduction study. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to wear comfortable shoes and socks, and we can discuss some simple exercises to help improve your balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, exercises? At my age? I'm not sure my bones can handle much exercise, dear. Very well. If you think it’s best. But don't expect miracles. I'm just not very coordinated. And the neurology thing… Is that going to be expensive? Medicare covers that, doesn't it? I really don't want to get a big bill. I’m on a fixed income, you know. Susan handles most of the paperwork, but I worry about these things. Just try to keep it simple, please. And not too painful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to my rambling, dear. I'm just a bit… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We'll keep everything as simple and comfortable as possible. Medicare should cover the neurology referral and nerve conduction study, but it’s always best to double-check with your insurance provider. I can have our billing department assist you with that if you’d like. And don’t worry about “rambling” – it’s my job to listen. I’ve added a note to the referral requesting a thorough explanation of the procedure and any potential costs. Also, I’ll write you a prescription for a mild vitamin D supplement, as low levels can contribute to fatigue and muscle weakness. Please schedule the blood tests and neurology appointment at your convenience. And if you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. .
