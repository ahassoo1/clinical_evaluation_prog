DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Minatra. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pehrson. It’s about some tests I had done recently… a GI Endo test, my records should say. The results weren’t quite what I expected, and frankly, a little concerning. I’m Denis Minatra, by the way, though the chart likely has that.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Minatra… GI Endo. Right. Look, I'm swamped, so let’s get to the point. Concerning how?
PATIENT: Well, the technician—a very nice young man, I recall his name was Samuel—said there was something unusual. He didn’t elaborate, said I needed to discuss it with a doctor. It wasn’t painful, thankfully, but the uncertainty is what troubles me. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. Perhaps you could tell me what exactly the test showed?
DOCTOR: Samuel, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Samuel. Very polite. He was quite careful during the procedure. I believe he said something about…irregularities? Though I may be misremembering the precise word. It's just that I haven’t had any problems, really. No pain, no…well, nothing that would lead me to think something was amiss. That's why I was so surprised by the results.
DOCTOR: Irregularities… right. Look, Mrs. Minatra, these tests aren't always straightforward. Let’s see… it appears you had an upper endoscopy performed on July 15th. The report mentions some mild esophagitis and… a few small polyps in the stomach. Nothing major, honestly. You're probably just…sensitive. A lot of people get this. It's often diet-related.
PATIENT: Polyps? I don’t believe anyone mentioned polyps to me before. Are those…serious, Doctor? And what does “sensitive” mean, exactly? I try to eat a rather balanced diet – mostly fruits and vegetables, with some fish. I haven’t had red meat in years. Could it be something else entirely? I apologize for all the questions, but I like to understand what is happening with my body.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Minatra, polyps can be serious, but these were small. Very small. And "sensitive" means your esophagus is a bit inflamed. It happens. The report does recommend a follow-up endoscopy in, let me see… three to five years. Unless you start having trouble swallowing or pain, there's really nothing to worry about. We'll monitor it. Frankly, you're wasting my time with this. Do you have any allergies I need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Wasting your time? Oh… I see. I didn’t realize I was causing an inconvenience. I’m truly sorry for taking up your time, Doctor. As for allergies… not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, food or otherwise. Though my late husband, God rest his soul, was terribly allergic to shellfish. Is this follow-up endoscopy something I should schedule with you, then? And what would be involved, precisely? Would it be the same procedure as before?
DOCTOR: Look, it's a standard procedure. Sedation, scope down the throat, look at the lining. It's not brain surgery. You can schedule it with the receptionist. Honestly, I have other patients, Mrs. Minatra. Unless you're actively bleeding or in severe pain, this can wait. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. I apologize again for keeping you. No, I don't take any regular medications. Not anymore. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. Said my lifestyle changes were enough. Just vitamins, really. A multivitamin and some Vitamin D in the winter months, as the sun isn’t as strong. Should I be concerned about these polyps affecting my overall health? Perhaps requiring further testing? I wouldn't want something to go unnoticed.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Minatra. Small polyps are common. Vitamin D isn’t going to change anything. Honestly, you’re a perfectly healthy woman. The follow-up endoscopy is just…standard protocol. No need to panic. We’re done here. Schedule the endoscopy. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished?
PATIENT: I… I suppose not. It’s just… it’s unsettling not understanding. But if you believe it’s nothing to be concerned about, I’ll trust your judgement, Doctor. I'll speak to the receptionist about scheduling the follow-up. Thank you for your time, though I do feel rather…dismissed. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day. Next!
