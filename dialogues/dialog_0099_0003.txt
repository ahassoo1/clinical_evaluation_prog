DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, welcome. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this…shaking. My hand. It’s been…well, a while now. Not a big deal, really. Just annoying. I just want something to stop it, if that’s possible. Don’t have time for this, you know. Lots to do.
DOCTOR: "Not a big deal," you say. Right. Well, "a while now" is a bit vague, Mr. Baide. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness gracious. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Months, I guess? Maybe longer. It comes and goes. When I try to…hold a glass, usually. Or write something. Not that I do much writing anymore. It’s just…there. A little quiver. It's not like I'm falling apart, Doctor. I’m still…functioning. Barely.
DOCTOR: “Barely functioning” is still something we need to address, Mr. Baide. And months is still useful information. Does anything trigger it, other than holding a glass or writing?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like…pulling the trigger on a gun? What kind of question is that? No, nothing triggers it. It just…happens. Sometimes when I’m…thinking hard, maybe? Or…upset. Though, what good is getting upset these days? Just makes things worse. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. It's a nuisance, not a life-threatening illness.
DOCTOR: Well, anything can be relevant, Mr. Baide. And dismissing it as "not life-threatening" doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate. Now, have you noticed it in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Other parts? Heavens, no. Just the hand. Mostly. Sometimes a little bit in the…other hand, now that you mention it. But it’s barely noticeable. Look, I'm 80 years old! Things are gonna shake a little, aren't they? It's called getting old, Doctor. Have you heard of it?
DOCTOR: I am aware of the aging process, Mr. Baide. But we need to rule out other possibilities before simply attributing it to age. Have you noticed any stiffness, pain, or weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Weakness? Not really. A little tired sometimes, but that's just…being my age, again. Stiffness…maybe a little in the mornings. But who isn’t stiff in the mornings at my age? Honestly, you’re asking a lot of questions about something that’s…not important. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's just take a quick look. I’m going to check your reflexes and muscle tone. Just relax your arm. Hmm. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not dramatically. Now, can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Honestly, it's perfectly fine. Strong enough to…manage. Look, if you want to know if I can still lift a glass of wine, the answer is yes. That’s all that really matters, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I see. And can you tap your finger to your thumb repeatedly, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Honestly, it's…difficult. Always was bad with these little…motor skills things. Look, I was never a surgeon, if that's what you're getting at. I was a director. Big difference. It’s…fine. Just a little…slow.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it could be essential tremor. It's a common neurological condition, particularly as people age. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a few blood tests to rule out other potential causes, like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. And possibly a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A neurologist? Goodness gracious. More appointments, more waiting… honestly, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. But… fine. If you insist. Just…please, don’t keep me waiting all day. I have a life, you know. A busy one. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll order the blood work now, and I’ll send a referral to Dr. Chen, a neurologist I trust. The lab results usually take a few days. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and the neurologist’s recommendations. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that exacerbate the shaking if possible. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, no. That’s it. Just… get it done. Honestly, the sooner I can forget about this whole thing, the better. Thank you… I suppose. But don’t expect me to be thrilled about any of this.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the referral information. Have a… day.
PATIENT: .
