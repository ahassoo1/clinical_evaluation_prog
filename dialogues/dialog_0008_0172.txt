DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Really. It’s just… a social visit, I believe. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Though I can’t quite recall why we moved. Something about… better weather, perhaps? Honestly, all this fuss seems a bit unnecessary. I'm perfectly fine, as far as I know. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a routine check-up then, as per your husband’s request. To be thorough, even if you’re feeling well, I’d like to ask a few questions. It helps me get a baseline understanding of your health. Let's start with any current symptoms you are experiencing, even if they seem minor. Anything at all bothering you – aches, pains, fatigue, changes in appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms… Well, I do get tired, naturally. At my age, one expects a bit of fatigue, doesn't one? And my appetite… it comes and goes. I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t a clue what you’re looking for. Everything feels rather… normal. If you must know, my knees ache a bit when the weather changes. But that’s hardly a symptom, is it? It’s just… old age. Really, I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some variable appetite, knees aching with weather changes. We’ll certainly address those. Just to clarify, when you say variable appetite, are you losing weight unintentionally?
PATIENT: Unintentionally? Goodness, I haven't weighed myself in… well, I couldn’t say when. My husband handles all that. He's very particular about those things. I suppose… perhaps I haven’t been eating as much lately. Not because I want to, you understand, just… not as hungry. He’ll be furious if he finds out I've lost weight. He worries so. Honestly, I don't keep track of such trivial matters. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, possible unintentional weight loss. I understand your husband is concerned, and that's good. Let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you’re asking about things that happened… a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I think I had something… a touch of the blood pressure, perhaps? But it was years ago. My husband manages all my medications now, so I really have no idea what I'm taking. Arthritis, you say? Possibly. My joints do ache, as I mentioned. Everything feels a bit… foggy. I truly don’t recall specifics. Is this essential information? I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself.
DOCTOR: I understand this is frustrating, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything. It's helpful to have some idea, even if it's vague. Since your husband manages your medications, do you know if he has a list with him today, or perhaps the names of the medications themselves?
PATIENT: Oh, he always has a list. A very detailed list, I assure you. He fusses over everything. Though, honestly, the names are… Greek to me. He keeps it in his briefcase, I believe. He’s parked outside, perhaps you could ask him? I really don’t want to bother him; he's such a busy man. This is all so tedious, Doctor. I simply wanted a quick check-up to appease him, not an interrogation. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. We can certainly proceed without the list for now. Let’s talk about family history then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now that’s a difficult one. My family… well, there weren’t many of us. And those I do recall… they all lived very long lives, as far as I know. A few passed away peacefully in their sleep, I believe. No… nothing significant comes to mind. Perhaps a touch of… melancholy, on my mother’s side? But that’s hardly a medical condition, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite faint. This is all very stressful. Can we please wrap this up soon? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. We’ll move on. Before we finish, let me just ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… well, he used to, years ago, but he quit. A very sensible man, my husband. This is quite enough questioning, Doctor. I’ve answered all I can. Honestly, I’m rather exhausted now. Is there anything else? I have a perfectly good luncheon waiting. I do hope this hasn't taken too much of your time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. No smoking history. Given your age and the limited information available, and your husband’s concern, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It will be quick. Would that be alright?
