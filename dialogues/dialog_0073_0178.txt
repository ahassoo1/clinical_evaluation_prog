DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's this cough. It just won't quit. And I'm always tired, even when I get some sleep. Seems like I'm always fighting off a sinus infection too. It’s been going on for a while now, and frankly, it's getting old.
DOCTOR: A cough, fatigue, and recurrent sinus issues… alright. Let's start with the cough. How long have you been dealing with this cough, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that's a good question. Probably… six months, maybe longer? It comes and goes, but it always seems to come back. It’s worse in the mornings, usually, and when the weather changes. I can't really pinpoint an exact date, to be honest. I don’t keep track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Six months… that is a while. And it’s worse with changes in weather, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Cold air, even just going from inside to outside… it’ll set it off. And sometimes it feels like it’s deep in my chest, you know? Not just a little tickle in my throat. It feels… heavier. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A deeper, chesty cough… alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Is this constant tiredness new, or has it been an ongoing issue?
PATIENT: It's gotten worse recently, I think. I've always been a little tired, working my job and all, but this is… different. Like I just don't have the energy to do things, even things I normally enjoy. I find myself just wanting to sit and rest all the time. It’s frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: I work in food processing. It's… not glamorous work. Mostly packaging and stuff. It's pretty physical, though, always on my feet. It’s not the cleanest environment either, if that makes a difference. Lots of dust and… smells.
DOCTOR: Food processing… alright. And you mentioned recurrent sinus infections. How often would you say you're dealing with those?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. Seems like every few months, I get one. Stuffy nose, headache, the whole deal. I usually just ride it out with over-the-counter stuff, but they keep coming back. It's a nuisance, really. I don't want to keep taking pills all the time.
DOCTOR: Every few months… I see. Let’s take a look at your medical history here… Alright. I see you’ve had a few documented sinus infections in the past year. And some notations about mild hypertension, managed with medication. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Blood pressure’s been a little high for a while now, but the doctor has me on something for it. It seems to keep it under control, mostly. I take it every day, like I’m supposed to. I don’t really pay much attention to the details, though. It’s just something I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and taken all sorts of pills when I’ve been sick. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Though… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’m outdoors. But I figured that was just bugs or something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Get it over with, I guess. I got things to do. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I don’t like spending too much time at the doctor’s.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pithan. Let's get started then. Please sit back and relax. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Lungs sound… slightly congested, some mild wheezing present. And sinuses are tender to the touch. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but not drastically so.
PATIENT: Ugh. See? I told you my blood pressure was a little high. Is that bad? Look, can we just figure out what’s wrong with my cough and get me some medicine? I really don’t have time for a lot of tests and poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, I understand your frustration, but rushing through this won’t help us determine the cause of your symptoms. We need to rule things out. Elevated blood pressure is concerning, and the congestion in your lungs and recurrent sinus issues… well, there are several possibilities. It could be a chronic infection, allergies, or even something more serious. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And a complete blood count to check for infection. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests… just what I was afraid of. Fine. Whatever. Just… how long is this going to take? And is it expensive? I don’t want a huge bill. I’m on a fixed income, you know. Honestly, I just want to feel better. I’m tired of coughing and being sick all the time.
DOCTOR: The tests shouldn’t take too long, Mr. Pithan. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and the blood work will be sent to the lab. As for the cost… I can’t give you an exact amount, but I’ll have the billing department check your insurance coverage and give you an estimate before any procedures are done. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help with the wheezing. And I recommend over-the-counter decongestant and saline nasal spray for the sinus issues. But these are just temporary measures. We need those test results to determine the underlying cause. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. An inhaler and some sprays… that's something, I guess. As long as it helps me breathe a little easier. Look, can I just get the prescription and go? I really need to get going. I appreciate you trying to help, Doctor, but honestly, I'm not a fan of hospitals and doctors and all that. I just want this cough to go away. .
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Pithan. The prescription for the albuterol inhaler. Please follow the instructions carefully. And please, do schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the test results. It's crucial that we get to the bottom of this. The nurse will schedule that for you on your way out. Have a… day.
