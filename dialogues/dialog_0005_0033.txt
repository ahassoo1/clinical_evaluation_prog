DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor… Donate, is it? Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… well, things aren’t working properly. My sight, and my hearing… they’ve just… gone. Suddenly. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: “Suddenly,” you say. And when did this “sudden” change occur, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m terrible with dates. Let me think… it was… sometime last week, I suppose. Perhaps a few days before that. It's all rather blurry, you see. I was preparing for a conference – a very important one – and noticed I couldn’t quite see the slides as clearly. Then, the voices… muffled. Honestly, Doctor, it's quite distressing when one can't properly discern what people are saying. It's simply dreadful. I really don’t have time for this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: “Last week.” Right. And was this a gradual decline, or did it happen all at once?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a difficult question. It wasn’t… pleasant, either way. I believe it was… a little of both. One morning, everything seemed…normal enough. The next, it was…dimmer. And the sounds… fainter. It wasn’t as if I woke up completely deaf and blind, you understand. It just… faded. Is that… helpful? Honestly, I don’t see why it matters how it happened, as long as it’s fixed.
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Julie, because different speeds of onset can indicate different problems. Now, has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Absolutely not. I’ve always had perfectly good eyesight, thank you very much. And my hearing…well, I’ve always been able to hear quite well. People often commented on it. No, this is entirely new. And frankly, rather alarming. I don’t understand why you need to know all these details. It just happened. Surely you can just…fix it? This is what you’re paid for, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, medicine isn't always so straightforward. We need to understand why this happened before we can discuss a solution. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the vision and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness. Let me think… I have been rather tired, I suppose. But then, who isn’t tired these days? And my head has been a little…fuzzy. But again, that could be anything. I’ve been very busy. Honestly, Doctor, I don't spend my time cataloging every little ache and pain. I have more important things to worry about. Are you quite sure there isn't something you can just do? Perhaps a…stronger pair of glasses? Or a hearing aid?
DOCTOR: We’ll get to those things, Ms. Julie. But first, I need some more information. Have you noticed any dizziness, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're just listing things! No, no dizziness. I haven’t fallen or anything. Weakness…well, perhaps a little tired, as I mentioned. Numbness? No. And my speech is perfectly clear, thank you very much. I was a debater in my youth, you know. A very good one. Honestly, this is…quite frustrating. I’m a very important person with a very busy schedule, and I’m wasting valuable time here being asked about things that are clearly irrelevant.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, with all due respect, these questions are relevant. Sudden vision and hearing loss can be a sign of several serious conditions, and it's my job to rule those out. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or any infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Illnesses… let me see. I think I had a bit of a sniffle a few months ago, but it was nothing serious. Just a little congestion. I simply took some… something. A decongestant, I believe. Honestly, I can't recall the specifics. I have a housekeeper who manages my medications. I simply take what she gives me. Is this going to help you fix my eyesight and hearing, or are we just going to continue this…interrogation? I haven't got all day, you know. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand you are busy, but I need a complete medical history to provide you with the best care. Your reliance on someone else to manage your medications is concerning. Do you have any allergies to medications?
