DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my kidneys, mostly. I get a pain in my side quite often, and… and I seem to be getting water infections a lot these days. It's been happening for a while now, and it’s starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Recurring flank pain and frequent urinary tract infections. Alright. Let’s start with the flank pain. Could you describe the pain to me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp, stabbing pain. It's on my back, just below my ribs, on both sides, though sometimes one side is worse than the other. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it's uncomfortable enough to keep me awake at night sometimes. It doesn’t really seem to be brought on by anything in particular… just happens.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, bilateral, intermittent, occasionally worse on one side… and disrupts sleep. And you say it isn't related to any specific activity?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I haven’t been lifting anything heavy or anything like that. I mostly just potter about the garden, do a bit of cooking… nothing strenuous. It just… is. It’s a bit of a nuisance, really. I suppose I just thought it was old age catching up with me, at first.
DOCTOR: While age does come with certain… changes, it’s always best to investigate. Now, let’s discuss these urinary tract infections. How often would you say you are experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly… but maybe every few months, at least? Sometimes it feels like more often than that, but I don't keep a precise record, you see. I usually just feel a burning sensation when I go to the toilet, and a sort of… urgency, if you know what I mean. Then I go to the doctor, get some tablets, and it clears up for a while. But it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Recurring UTIs every few months, with typical symptoms – dysuria and urgency. And these are treated with antibiotics, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. Antibiotics. Usually a short course, a few days worth. They seem to work, but… well, it feels like I’m constantly on them, or just finished a course, and then it happens again. It worries me a little, to be honest. I don’t want to become resistant to them, or something.
DOCTOR: A legitimate concern, Mr. Espinueva. Repeated antibiotic use can certainly lead to resistance. Let’s delve into your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I was told a few years back, maybe five or six years ago now, that my kidneys weren’t quite right. The doctor said something about… cysts. Polycystic kidneys, I think it was called. I don’t remember all the details, I’m afraid. They did some scans, and then just told me to keep an eye on things and come back if I felt unwell. I didn't really understand it all at the time, to be honest. I've not had much trouble until recently.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… that is relevant. And you’ve had no follow-up scans since that initial diagnosis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. They didn’t book any, and I didn't push it, really. I felt alright for a long time, so I just… forgot about it, if you know what I mean. It’s only now, with this pain and these infections, that I’m starting to worry about it again. I suppose I should have followed up, but I didn't.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable, Mr. Espinueva, but it’s good you’re addressing it now. Given the history of polycystic kidney disease, and these recurrent infections and flank pain, I'd like to conduct a thorough physical exam, and order some laboratory tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, really. I’m happy to have an exam and tests. I just want to find out what’s going on, and hopefully get some relief from this pain. And stop having these infections, of course!
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just step over here and lie down on the examination table. I'll start with listening to your abdomen and back, then we’ll palpate to check for any tenderness. I’ll need to check your vital signs as well.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I'm not very good with all this medical stuff, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Just breathe normally. Now, I'm listening to your abdomen… sounds are within normal limits. Now, let's listen to your back. Breathing appears normal here as well. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen and back. Please let me know immediately if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, that's alright, Doctor. Not painful there, just… normal, I suppose. A little bit of pressure, but nothing unpleasant. Oh, wait… just there, on my right side, it's a bit tender. Not sharp, but… yeah, a little bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Tenderness noted on the right flank. That’s helpful. Is that a constant tenderness, or does it only occur when I press?
PATIENT: It’s not really constant, Doctor. I don’t normally feel it. It only appears when you press on it, like that. It’s not too bad, but definitely there. I don't think I've ever noticed it before today, to be honest. Just the general ache, and the pain when I go to the toilet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. That’s sufficient for the physical exam at this stage. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that includes kidney function tests – and a urinalysis. I also want to order a renal ultrasound to visualize your kidneys and assess for any structural abnormalities or cysts. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. And contrast dye… I don't think I've ever had anything with dye in it, but I’m happy to have it if you think it's necessary. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Excellent. I’ll order those tests now. The lab technician will draw blood, and we’ll schedule the renal ultrasound for as soon as possible. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you after this consultation. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, chills, severe back pain, or inability to urinate, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Fever, chills, severe back pain, can’t pee… go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing we're getting things checked out. It’s been worrying me, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It’s my pleasure. It’s always best to be proactive about your health. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your time and patience. I’ll just wait to hear from you about the results. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Espinueva. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling the ultrasound and answer any administrative questions you may have. I wish you a good day, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if any concerns arise.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help. .
