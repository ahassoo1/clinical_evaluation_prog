DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Burlingham, is it? Yes, yes. Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My daughter kept saying I should get something checked, you know, just to be safe. She worries too much, that one. I feel perfectly fine, really. Just… thought I’d see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like anything hurts.
DOCTOR: "Curiosity," you say. Alright. Well, it’s never a bad thing to be proactive about your health, even if you’re feeling well. Your daughter sounds like a sensible girl. But “perfectly fine” can mean different things to different people. Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, I get tired easily, I suppose. But who doesn't get tired? I'm 64, you know. It's just...life. And my knees, they sometimes ache a bit when it rains. Though, honestly, those knees have seen a lot of work over the years. I was a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember how long anymore. Decades, definitely. Is that what you mean by specific? It’s all very vague, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is more specific. Tiredness and achy knees… common complaints, certainly. But we need to rule things out. Just because something is common doesn’t mean we ignore it. Now, this tiredness… is it a new thing, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a while. I don't know... years, probably? It sort of creeps up on you, doesn't it? One day you realize you're needing more naps than you used to. It’s not like I can’t do things. I still manage the garden, and I see my friends. I just… don’t have the energy for a whole day of running around like I used to. It's probably just old age, honestly. I'm not expecting a miracle cure or anything.
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. Well, we don't simply accept fatigue as part of aging without investigating. It could be a multitude of things – vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, even something more serious. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history... Let me see. My husband, bless his soul, had… something with his heart, I think. A blockage. But that was years ago. And… I had my gallbladder out. Ages and ages ago. And… honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I don’t really remember much beyond that. I wasn’t one for doctors when I was younger. I just tried to get on with things, you know? I’m not very good with all the medical details. Is there a list somewhere? I'm sure my daughter has all this information written down. She keeps everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your daughter sounds very thorough. We’ll see if we can access your records electronically here. In the meantime, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Aside from the gallbladder… Oh! Yes, I had a hysterectomy. That was… probably in my thirties. It was… routine, I suppose. Though I remember being very tired afterward. Longer than I expected, actually. And… I think I had something done on my knee, years and years ago. A meniscus tear, maybe? I was very active then. Lots of lifting in the operating room, you know. But it’s all so long ago. Honestly, it's like a different life. I don't remember the details, just the recovery. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It's helpful, yes. We're building a picture here. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... that's a tough one. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hands. Couldn't knit anymore, poor thing. And my father… he died of a stroke, I believe. Suddenly. A very healthy man one day, gone the next. And… my brother had high blood pressure, I think. He was always a bit of a worrier, that one. Is that the kind of thing you mean? It's all very… sad, really. I try not to dwell on it. Makes you worry too much, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the kind of thing I mean. Stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis… okay. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I take a multivitamin, of course. Just something to keep me going. And when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, you know? Nothing fancy. And… sometimes I take something for sleep. Just a little something to help me drift off. It’s not every night, just when I’m really restless. My daughter keeps telling me I shouldn't be taking anything without checking with a doctor, but… it helps. A little. Is that alright? I don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen, a multivitamin, and something for sleep… We'll need to get specifics on that sleep medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... let me see. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s it. My daughter is very careful about what she feeds me, you know? She's always checking labels. I think I'm pretty safe. Honestly, I’m not a very complicated patient. It’s all very… simple. I just want to make sure I'm not bothering you with all this.
DOCTOR: Right. Simple. Now, Ms. Calvery, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Sounds sensible. Do whatever you need to do. Honestly, I trust your judgment. Just… don’t poke too much, alright? My knees are a bit sensitive. And… please don't tell me anything too alarming. I’m not very good with bad news. I just came for a little check-up, you know? A little curiosity visit. Don't make it into a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat here. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Please remove your shoes and socks. It won't be a "whole thing," Ms. Calvery. Just a routine check. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is clear, heart sounds are regular, although a slight murmur is present. Not necessarily concerning, but something to keep an eye on. Now, your knees... there's some crepitus present, and tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of both knees. Range of motion is somewhat limited, especially with flexion. Do you experience any swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, swelling... not usually. Maybe a little bit after I’ve been gardening for a long time, but nothing major. It goes down after a while. I just try to rest them. And… I put on a little bit of that cream my daughter gave me. The one that smells like menthol. It helps a little, I think. Honestly, I've just gotten used to the aches and pains. It's just part of getting older, isn't it? I don't want to make a fuss over something that's probably nothing. I just… I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some age-related wear and tear in your knees, likely osteoarthritis. The fatigue could be related to a number of things, including the osteoarthritis, but it’s worth investigating further. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. Now, I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. I also want you to get an X-ray of both knees to assess the extent of the osteoarthritis. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest your knees when they're bothering you and apply the menthol cream. I’m going to prescribe a mild pain reliever for occasional use, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. It’s important to take it as directed and not exceed the recommended dosage. We'll discuss these results and decide on a longer-term management plan when we get them back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and X-rays? That sounds… a lot. Honestly, I was hoping for something simpler. But… alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment. Just… please don’t tell me anything too alarming. I get worried easily, you know? And… I don’t want to be a bother. The pain reliever sounds good, though. Maybe that will help me get a good night’s sleep. And… will this cost a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know. I don't want to get a big bill. I'm sure my daughter will help, but... I don't want to make a fuss. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: The blood work and X-rays are standard procedure, Ms. Calvery, to get a clear picture of what’s going on. It's not about causing alarm, it’s about being thorough. As for the cost, I’ll have the billing department check your Medicare coverage and give you an estimate before you proceed with anything. They can also discuss payment options with you. Now, I'd like you to start keeping a daily log of your fatigue levels. Just a simple rating scale, from 1 to 10, 1 being no fatigue and 10 being completely exhausted. This will help us track your symptoms and see if the pain reliever is helping. And, I strongly recommend you discuss weight management with me at your follow-up appointment. Carrying extra weight puts additional stress on your knees and can worsen your symptoms. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and X-rays and go over your fatigue log. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, a log… and weight management… honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming. But alright, dear. I'll try. I'll keep the log, and... I'll try to lose a little weight. But please don't expect miracles. I enjoy my food, you know? Two weeks… that sounds alright. I just… I hope it's not anything too serious. And… I don't want to be a bother. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Anything at all? I just want to be sure I don't forget anything. I get confused easily, you know.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery. That’s all for today. You have the fatigue log form, and the billing department will contact you regarding the blood work and X-rays. Just try to rest your knees when they're bothering you, take the pain reliever as directed, and keep me updated on your fatigue levels. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for August 16th at 10:00 AM. Honestly, you’ve done all you need to do today. Try not to worry too much, and remember, we’re just being proactive about your health. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Thank you. I think. August 16th… I’ll try to remember. I really will. You’ve been very helpful, I think. Or… thorough. Yes, thorough. Now, which way is the door? My daughter usually comes with me, you know. I get lost easily. .
