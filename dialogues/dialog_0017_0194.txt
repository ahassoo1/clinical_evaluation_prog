DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And, um, my head gets dizzy sometimes with it. It comes and goes, you know? It’s hard to explain… it’s just been happening lately. My daughter, she said I really should come in. She worries.
DOCTOR: "Lately," you say. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… It’s been… a few months, I think? Maybe longer? Time gets away from me, you know. It started, well, it started after… after my husband passed. It’s been a bit of a blur since then, honestly. The dizziness wasn’t right away, though. It came a little later. Just… not as steady as it used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. And these episodes of dizziness… can you describe what they feel like?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… whooshy. Like everything is spinning, but I’m not moving, if that makes sense? It’s hard to stand, and sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach with it. Not always, but sometimes. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it’s scary when it happens. Especially when I’m out… It makes me nervous to go anywhere, to be honest.
DOCTOR: And does anything trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes it happens when I’m bending over, maybe? Or… if I turn my head too quickly. But honestly, sometimes it just happens for no reason at all. It's very random. I used to work at the casino, you know, dealing cards. Lots of quick head movements there, but it never bothered me then. It's just… now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or any fullness or pressure in your ears?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s part of it, too. My hearing… it goes in and out. Sometimes it’s muffled, like I have cotton in my ears. And yes, ringing. A high-pitched ring, mostly. It’s not constant, but it’s there sometimes, especially after one of those dizzy spells. I don’t know if they’re connected, but…
DOCTOR: It’s likely related. Now, let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. My daughter handles most of that now. It's on here somewhere... Amlodipine, yes. And… allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had any problems with medicine, to my recollection. A little sensitive to the sun, maybe, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to perform a quick examination of your ears. Please sit up straight and remain still.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would. My ears are a bit sensitive, you know? Especially when I’m feeling… off.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some cerumen buildup in both ear canals. The tympanic membranes appear slightly retracted bilaterally. No visible signs of acute infection. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Oh dear… I’m not very good at this, am I? It’s… a little hard to stand, even with my eyes closed. Maybe I should sit down? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: As expected. Your Romberg test is positive. Your balance is impaired. It appears we're dealing with a fairly straightforward case of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, likely exacerbated by cerumen impaction. We can address this with a simple cerumen removal and some Epley maneuvers.
PATIENT: Oh… Cerumen… and Epley… what? Is that… is that going to hurt? I don't like things in my ears, Doctor. And I don’t want anything… maneuvered. Is there anything else we can do? I just want to feel normal again, you know? .
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Mayhugh, I assure you this is a very common and simple procedure. The cerumen removal will simply clear the blockage, and the Epley maneuver will reposition the crystals in your inner ear. It may cause some brief discomfort, but it's far less unpleasant than continuing to live with these dizzy spells. It’s a matter of practicality. Now, if you’ll just recline this chair…
