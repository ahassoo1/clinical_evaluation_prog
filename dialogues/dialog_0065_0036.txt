DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I am here… for the check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? My friend, he said I need this. It is… important.
DOCTOR: A check-up before your insurance activates, you say. Right. Well, that's... proactive. Though generally, a check-up is done after insurance is active, to utilize the coverage. But we can certainly proceed. To clarify, is there anything specific you're concerned about, or is this purely for a general assessment?
PATIENT: Generally… yes. Nothing is wrong. I feel… okay. But my friend, he said it is good to know, yes? To be sure. He pays for good insurance, and he said I should do this before so we don’t waste money later. I do not understand why it matters when exactly, but he is smart.
DOCTOR: I see. Your friend is… conscientious. While I appreciate the initiative, a 'baseline' check-up before insurance is active doesn't typically offer significant advantages, and as you said, may not be covered. However, we can still gather some information. To start, can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… I work. A lot. Food processing. It is… hard work. Lifting boxes, cleaning machines. I eat when I can. Mostly rice and… meat things. I do not get sick often. Maybe a cold, once a year. I sleep… enough. Usually. I do not do… exercise. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Right. Food processing. That is physically demanding. And 'meat things' isn't terribly informative, but we can get to that. Yes, exercise is important for overall health, but we’ll address that later. Let's focus on the present. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently – either gain or loss?
PATIENT: Changes in weight… Hmm. No, I do not think so. Maybe a little… heavier, during the holidays. But not much. I always gain a little when my mother cooks. She makes very good food. But I go back to normal after. I think. I do not… weigh myself often. It is not important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I do not take anything. I do not like pills. My mother, she takes pills for her… bones, I think. But I do not need pills. I am strong. I eat healthy things when I can, and that is enough. I do not get headaches or… stomach problems. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I have broken a finger, when I was a boy, playing football. But that is it. Just a little break. They wrapped it, and it healed. I do not like hospitals. They smell… bad. And the doctors ask too many questions. Like now.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Barban. However, a thorough history is vital. Have you had any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, no surgeries. I told you. Just the finger. They did not… cut me open. They wrapped it with a bandage. It was… quick. I do not like doctors touching me. It is… uncomfortable. My mother says I am a strong man and do not need doctors.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother, she has problems with her bones, like I said. And my father… he had problems with his heart. He… passed away a few years ago. He did not go to the doctor much. He said they would just tell him to stop eating good food. Which is… not helpful. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. She lives in another city. We do not talk often.
DOCTOR: I see. Heart problems in your father and bone issues in your mother. That's… pertinent information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My mother makes many different foods. Spices, meats, rice, vegetables... I have never had a problem. Maybe a little… spicy sometimes, but that is not an allergy. It is… good flavor. I do not react to anything. I am a strong man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick visual assessment. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: I do not like being touched, Doctor. But… if it is quick, I suppose. Just… please be gentle. And do not take too long. I have things to do. Work, you know. And my friend will want to know how much this costs.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. First, I need to check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We'll need to monitor that. Now, let me listen to your heart. I detect a slight murmur. That requires further investigation. And finally, your lungs. Your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: Elevated? Murmur? What does that mean? I feel fine. It is just… work. It is hard work, like I said. Lifting boxes, cleaning machines… Maybe that is it? I do not want… tests. Tests are expensive. And I do not like hospitals. Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, an elevated blood pressure and a heart murmur are not normal, regardless of how physically demanding your work is. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong at this moment, but they require further evaluation to determine the underlying cause and prevent potential complications down the line. Ignoring them could lead to more significant health issues. I understand your concerns about costs and hospitals, but I am obligated to recommend some basic tests. An EKG – that's a simple heart tracing – and a blood test to check your cholesterol and other relevant markers. A referral to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of the heart – is also advisable. Would you like me to explain the process of each test, and the potential costs involved, or shall we proceed with arranging the referrals?
PATIENT: Complications… Echocardiogram… You are scaring me now, Doctor. My friend did not say anything about… tests. He just said I needed a check-up. I do not want to spend a lot of money. Is this… is this because I do not take pills? My mother says pills are bad for you. Just tell me… will I be okay? If I just… keep working, and eating rice and meat… will it go away? Perhaps it is just stress. I work very hard, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, your mother’s beliefs are… irrelevant in this situation. While I understand your apprehension, ignoring these findings will not make them disappear. In fact, it could lead to a much more serious and costly medical intervention down the line. The elevated blood pressure and murmur could be indicative of several things – from a relatively benign condition to something requiring treatment. I cannot ethically disregard these findings without proper investigation. Look, I can arrange for you to see a cardiologist who is covered by your insurance – to the best of my understanding. They will explain the tests in detail, discuss potential treatment options, and answer all your questions. I will also write a referral for a basic blood panel, and we can discuss the results when they come back. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health. This is not about taking pills; it’s about preventative care. And frankly, it is my professional obligation to ensure you receive it. Will you allow me to proceed with those referrals?
PATIENT: … Fine. But… no complicated tests. Just… the blood work. And the… doctor who is covered by the insurance. And please… no lectures. I work very hard. I am a strong man. I do not need to be told what to do. Just… do the tests. And tell me… tell me what they cost. Before you do them.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will submit the referral for the cardiologist covered by Medicare, Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. The basic blood panel will cost approximately $85, depending on the lab. I will provide you with a printed lab requisition and a cost estimate. I strongly advise you to keep the appointment with Dr. Sharma. An echocardiogram may be necessary, but we can discuss that when you meet with her. I must emphasize that I am not providing a definitive diagnosis at this time, and I cannot guarantee any specific outcome. This is simply a precautionary measure. Are there any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think… that is all. Just… tell me where to go for the blood work. And I will go. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: The lab is located at 142 Elm Street – the address and directions are on that pamphlet. You do not need an appointment. Very well. Take care, Mr. Barban. And please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. .
