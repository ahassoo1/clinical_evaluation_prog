DOCTOR: Alright, Tasmia, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not like I feel bad.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, that's... not entirely uncommon, honestly. High blood pressure often doesn't have symptoms, which is why it's good you're getting it checked. Still, it's something we need to take seriously. The phone lady… was that a nurse, or someone else?
PATIENT: Just some receptionist, I think. Didn't seem to know much about anything, really. She just read off a list of questions. Look, are we gonna do something about this or what? I got things to do today.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We will. It just takes a little time to gather some information first. It's not a quick fix, usually. First, let's get a better understanding of what's been going on. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is all new to me. And frankly, a bit of a waste of my time, if you ask me. I eat pretty healthy. Mostly. And I don't sit around all day. I'm a civil engineer technician, you know. I'm outside doing things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Civil engineer technician… so, pretty active job, then. That's helpful. And you said mostly healthy?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. I try to. My husband, he likes to grill a lot of red meat. Steaks, burgers... things like that. I usually have a salad with it, though. Does that count? And sometimes we get takeout. Pizza, usually on Fridays. It's not like I'm eating junk food all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a bit of a picture. Red meat a few times a week, takeout occasionally. It’s good you’re balancing it with salad, that’s a positive. Now, do you add salt to your food, either when you're cooking or at the table?
PATIENT: Salt? Uh... sometimes. My husband likes it. He puts it on everything. I don't really need it, but I don't exactly stop him. It doesn't hurt anything, does it? I mean, a little salt? People have been using salt for… forever.
DOCTOR: Well, that's where things get a bit complicated. For some people, even a little extra salt can raise blood pressure. It's not necessarily about whether people use salt, it's about how much and how sensitive someone is to it. Let’s talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family—parents, grandparents, siblings—have high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm. My dad… I think so. He was always going to the doctor. I don't really remember what for, exactly. He passed away a few years ago. And my grandma on my mother's side, she had something with her heart. I don't know what, though. Old age, probably. They didn't really tell us much. A lot of it was in Navajo, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Family history of potential heart issues is important. And you mentioned some of that information was in Navajo… do you speak the language yourself?
PATIENT: Not fluently. My grandparents spoke it, and they tried to teach me when I was little, but I didn't really pay attention. I was more interested in… well, other things. English is what I use. It's more practical. Honestly, this whole conversation is taking too long. What are you going to do about my blood pressure? Are we gonna give me a pill or something?
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Tasmia. I understand your frustration. Before we jump to medication—which may or may not be necessary—I want to get a complete picture. We'll need to do a physical exam—check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, of course. It's standard procedure. Then, depending on what we find, we might need to do some blood work just to rule out other possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. Don't take all day, though. I got a site inspection this afternoon. And I need to be on time. People are depending on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just hop up on the table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first, and then we'll check your blood pressure. Please try to relax as much as possible. Deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Hurry up. I don't like being poked and prodded. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is… 152 over 94. And again… 155 over 92. Elevated. This confirms what the nurse mentioned. Alright. Elevated blood pressure. That's what we're dealing with. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. This will just take a minute.
PATIENT: So, what does that mean? Is it serious? Look, I'm a perfectly healthy person. This has to be a mistake. I don't feel sick. And I don't want to take any pills if I don't need them. Do you understand? I have things to do. I can't just sit around and be sick all the time. How much longer is this going to take?
DOCTOR: Alright, abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Everything else seems… within normal limits. Okay, Tasmia. Based on what we've discussed and the physical exam, your blood pressure is elevated. While you might not be feeling any symptoms right now, consistently high blood pressure can lead to serious problems down the road – heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, things like that. It's not necessarily a "mistake," and it doesn't mean you're "sick" right now, but it is something we need to address. It's not uncommon, and there are things we can do about it. Before we talk about medications – and we may not even need them yet – I'd like to order some basic blood work. It will help rule out any underlying causes and give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Great. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Look, can’t we just… monitor it? I’ll take my blood pressure at home. My husband has one. We'll see what happens. I don’t want to spend all my time in doctors’ offices. I have a job to do. Are you sure it's not just because I was stressed coming here? This whole thing is stressful! Sitting around waiting, getting poked and prodded… it’s probably just that. .
DOCTOR: While stress can temporarily raise blood pressure, Tasmia, the numbers we're seeing are significantly elevated. Relying solely on home monitoring isn’t enough to get a complete picture, and doesn’t rule out underlying issues. I understand your concerns, but I have a professional obligation to ensure you receive the appropriate care. The blood work is a relatively simple step that can provide valuable information. It’s not a waste of your time, it’s responsible medicine. I’m ordering a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. It’ll give us a good baseline. The lab is just down the hall. You can go anytime. I also want you to start keeping a log of your blood pressure at home for a week, even with the home monitoring, and note your activity levels and any stress you’re experiencing. We’ll review those results, along with the blood work, at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Would that be acceptable?
