DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr… Dashevsky, was it? Yes, well, honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter, bless her heart, thought I should just… get checked out. She worries too much, that one. I feel fine, mostly. Just a little… old, I suppose. It's good to be proactive, isn’t it? Though I can't rightly recall what she was so insistent about.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your daughter, Ms. Calvery. It is always good to be proactive about your health. And it’s perfectly normal to feel a little… everything, as we get older! So, let's try to narrow things down. When you say "a little old," can you tell me about any specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my knees ache sometimes, getting up and down. And I forget things, naturally. Though, that’s been happening for… well, a long time. It’s not new. I wouldn’t call it a symptom, more like… how it is. Is that helpful? I’m really not good at this sort of thing, you know. Doctors always ask such specific questions. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Calvery, don’t worry at all. It’s perfectly fine if things blur together – that’s why I’m here to help sort it out. Knee pain and memory concerns are both things we can certainly explore. Let's start with the knees. When did you first notice the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… Honestly? It feels like forever ago. Probably… a few years, at least. It comes and goes, you know? Worse in the cold weather, I think. And after I’ve been on my feet too long. I used to be a surgical tech, you see. Lots of standing. Though that was… a while back now. Not as much standing these days, thankfully. Is that what you wanted to know? When it started? It’s hard to pinpoint, really.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know about your previous profession, Ms. Calvery. Standing for long periods can certainly contribute to knee pain. And it’s good you’ve noticed it's worse with the cold and prolonged activity. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your knee pain is at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale? Really? I’m not good with numbers, dear. Let me think… At its worst… hmm. It’s not debilitating, not like I can’t walk. But it’s… uncomfortable. Maybe a… six? Does that sound right? It throbs sometimes, especially if I’ve been trying to do too much gardening. My daughter says I overdo it. She's probably right, bless her. Six. Yes, I think a six is fair. Though, honestly, it could be a five, or a seven. I’m not very precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. A six gives me a good idea. And it’s good to know it’s related to activity. Now, you mentioned some forgetfulness. Can you give me an example of what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to start? It’s not like I forget everything, you understand. More like… names. Or where I put my glasses. Though, I have them right here, so that’s not a good example. It’s just… little things. Last week, I went to visit Mrs. Henderson, and I couldn't recall her son’s name. We've known each other for years! And sometimes I start a story, and then… the thought just vanishes. It's frustrating, honestly. It's not like I'm losing my mind, is it? It's just… senior moments, I suppose. That's what my daughter calls them. Annoying senior moments.
DOCTOR: It sounds frustrating, Ms. Calvery, and it's perfectly normal to be concerned about memory changes. “Senior moments” is a common term, but it’s good we’re talking about it. To get a better understanding, has this forgetfulness been getting worse recently, or has it been fairly consistent over time?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a tricky question. I suppose… it's probably a little worse. Not dramatically, you understand. Just… more frequent, maybe? I used to be able to keep track of things better. Like appointments. Now I rely on my daughter to remind me. And I've been repeating myself more, I think. Though, everyone repeats themselves, don't they? It’s hard to say for certain. My memory… isn't what it used to be, so it’s difficult to recall how it was. Does that make sense? A bit circular, isn’t it? I apologize. This is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. It’s completely understandable that it’s difficult to assess changes when memory is involved. It sounds like it has been gradually worsening, and that's worth investigating. Now, I'd like to ask about other areas of your health, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, well, my appetite is… normal, I suppose. I eat when I’m hungry. Though, I don’t have a huge appetite, never have. And as for my weight… … I’ve lost a little, I think. Not intentionally. Just… not as much energy to cook, maybe? And things don't taste as good as they used to. My daughter worries about me not eating enough. She brings over soup a lot. Bless her heart. I think a few pounds, maybe? Nothing drastic. I wouldn't know the exact number. Numbers aren't my strong suit, dear.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Calvery. Losing weight unintentionally, even a few pounds, is something we should look into. And a decreased sense of taste can sometimes be related. To get a more complete picture, have you noticed any difficulty with your balance or coordination recently?
PATIENT: Oh, balance… hmm. No, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. Though, I am a bit more careful walking now. Especially on uneven surfaces. And I don't climb on ladders anymore, that's for sure! My daughter would have a fit. Just… a little steadier pace, that's all. Nothing major. My knees bother me more than anything when it comes to balance, honestly. I feel a bit clumsy sometimes, but that could just be getting older, couldn't it? It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you haven’t had any falls, Ms. Calvery. And it’s understandable that you’re being more cautious. Now, just a few more questions about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… The doctor always asks so many questions. I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… a long time ago now. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure once, but it’s been under control for years. I take a little pill for it, nothing fancy. Diabetes? No, I don't think so. Heart trouble? No, not that I know of. My heart feels alright, most of the time. My regular doctor always said I was healthy as a horse, but that was… before all this. Before the memory and the weight loss and everything. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. Knowing about your gallbladder removal and controlled blood pressure is important. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My daughter always worries about me trying new things, but I haven't had any bad reactions. Penicillin? No, I think I’m okay with that. I used to take some sort of allergy medicine as a child, but I don't recall what for. It was a long time ago. No, I don't have any allergies that I’m aware of. Unless… dust? I sneeze sometimes when I’m cleaning, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? It's just… dust. It gets everywhere, you know. Bless my daughter, she keeps the house spotless. But dust... still finds a way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Calvery. No known allergies is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Yes, just the little pill for my blood pressure. My regular doctor prescribed it. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. My daughter reminds me. She says I don’t get enough sunshine. And… oh! Sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my knees when they’re really bothering me. But that’s only as needed, you understand. Nothing regular. Just the blood pressure pill, the vitamin D sometimes, and the pain reliever for my knees. Is that everything? I'm trying to remember...It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Calvery. Knowing about the blood pressure medication, occasional vitamin D, and pain reliever for your knees is good. Okay, Ms. Calvery. I’m looking at your records now. It confirms the gallbladder removal and your blood pressure medication. It also shows a recent weight loss of approximately 8 pounds over the last six months. Your last physical exam was about a year ago and everything was within normal limits at that time. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, and a neurological assessment to get a better sense of your memory and balance. It will be nothing too invasive. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Eight pounds, you say? I hadn't realized it was that much. I do feel a bit weaker, I suppose. And the memory… well, you’ve already heard about that. Yes, alright, go ahead. A brief exam sounds fine. As long as it's not too strenuous. I don’t want to fall or anything. And… please be gentle? I'm not as spry as I used to be. Just take your time, dear. And tell me if anything feels… uncomfortable. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible and will explain everything as I go. And please, stop me at any time if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. It sounds regular, and there are no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear as well, with no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. This involves a gentle tap on your knee. It's perfectly normal, and shouldn’t be painful. Okay, your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Feet together, eyes closed… Oh dear… This isn't very good, is it? I feel a little wobbly. I don’t like this. It feels like I'm going to fall. Oh goodness. Maybe I shouldn't do this. It makes me feel quite dizzy. I think I’ll sit down. This isn't a good sign, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, you did exactly the right thing. It's perfectly alright to sit down. It's important to listen to your body. The slight unsteadiness and feeling of dizziness are worth noting. Okay, your balance is slightly impaired, and you reported feeling dizzy. We will take that into consideration. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. Just answer to the best of your ability. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Today’s date? Let me see… It's August, isn't it? August… and the day… Oh, I just can’t recall. Is it the 1st? No, that can't be right. My daughter told me… but I just can’t seem to grasp it. I’m so sorry. It's right on the tip of my tongue, but I just can’t remember. I’m usually better with dates, but… my mind just feels foggy today. Perhaps you could remind me?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s August 2nd. It’s understandable to have some difficulty recalling the date. We are just gathering information. Now, I’m going to name three objects, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me. And then, in a few minutes, I’ll ask you to recall them again. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Three objects… Yes, I think so. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. I used to be very good at remembering things. But lately… it’s been a struggle. I'm ready when you are. Don’t mind if it takes me a moment. I’m a bit slow today.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three objects are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… penny. Is that right? Apple, table, penny. I think I have them. It's a bit of a struggle, but I believe I have them. Now, what happens next? I’m a bit nervous. Don’t mind my hand shaking. It's just… the stress of it all.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. Calvery. You repeated them correctly. Now, we’ll move on to the rest of the physical exam. But first, let’s discuss what we’ve found so far. You’ve reported some knee pain, recent weight loss, a little forgetfulness that seems to be worsening, and some difficulty with balance. On the exam, I observed slightly diminished reflexes and some unsteadiness. Based on these findings, I think it’s important to investigate the cause of your weight loss and memory issues. There are a number of possibilities, and we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It could be something simple, like a vitamin deficiency, or something more complex. It is important we find out what is happening to ensure we provide appropriate care. I’d like to order some blood tests and a brain scan to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests and a brain scan? That sounds… quite serious. Is it something bad? Is there something wrong with my brain? I just want to get back to normal, you understand. I don’t want any fuss. It sounds rather frightening. What kind of things are you looking for with the blood tests? And what about the brain scan? Will it hurt? Is it… safe? I'm a bit nervous, dear. Just tell me honestly. I trust your judgment, but… it's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. I want to assure you that we are taking these steps to get a clearer picture of what's going on, not because I suspect something terrible, but to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. The blood tests will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies , thyroid problems, and any signs of inflammation. These can all affect memory and energy levels. The brain scan, which is a type of MRI, is a safe and painless procedure. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It won’t hurt at all, and it doesn’t involve any radiation. It will help us look for any structural abnormalities or signs of neurological issues. We are just trying to be thorough. The vast majority of the time, these tests come back normal. But it’s important to know what’s going on so we can provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, well… no radiation, you say? That’s good. I always worry about radiation. And vitamin deficiencies… that doesn’t sound so bad. But a scan of my brain… it’s just a bit unsettling. How long will the scan take? And will I have to lie still for a long time? I have trouble lying still, you see. My knees ache when I’m still for too long. And what about the blood tests? Will they take a lot of blood? I don’t like needles. And… what if they find something wrong? What then? Will I have to have surgery? Or… something else? I just want to know what I’m getting into. I need to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Calvery. Let’s address them one by one. The brain scan typically takes about 30-45 minutes. You will lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It's important to lie still during the scan, but we can provide padding and support to make you as comfortable as possible. We can also take breaks if needed. And we can give you some mild sedation if you’re particularly anxious. As for the blood tests, we'll only need a few vials of blood, about what you'd typically give when you have a routine check-up. I can ask the phlebotomist to be very gentle and take the blood slowly. And if the tests do reveal something, it doesn’t automatically mean surgery or anything drastic. We'll discuss the results with you in detail, explain all your options, and work with you to create a treatment plan that’s right for you. It could be as simple as taking vitamins, making lifestyle changes, or undergoing physical therapy. I understand you're anxious about the unknown, and I want to assure you that I’ll be with you every step of the way. We'll take things slowly, answer all your questions, and make sure you’re comfortable and informed. Would you like me to schedule the tests for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… well, if you promise to explain everything… and if you promise to take things slowly… Alright. Go ahead and schedule the tests. But please, make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. And let's try to get them done as soon as possible. I don’t want to keep worrying about it. And… could you give me a written summary of the tests? Just so I can have something to refer to. And perhaps a list of things I can do to help improve my memory in the meantime? You know, things like puzzles or… something else? I just want to feel like I’m doing something to help myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I will make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns and takes extra care. I’ll schedule the tests for you as soon as possible – how does next Tuesday morning sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday morning sounds alright. As long as it’s not too early. My knees aren't very good first thing in the morning. And yes, a written summary would be wonderful. And a list of things to help my memory… that would be very helpful as well. Perhaps something I can do while I’m waiting for the results? It’s good to keep busy, you know. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It makes me feel a little less worried. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to lie down. This has been quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It’s my pleasure. I understand it’s been a lot to take in, and it's perfectly alright to be tired. I’ll have my nurse print out a summary of the tests and a list of memory-boosting activities for you before you leave. She'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, take it easy. Get some rest, and we’ll get through this together.
