DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Good to meet you too, Doctor. Um… it’s… about starting a family. I think. My… someone I care about… we are thinking about having a baby. And I thought… maybe I should check if I am… okay, you know? Before it… happens. It's all a bit new to me, to be honest. It has been… a long time.
DOCTOR: Right, absolutely. That’s very responsible of you to think about this beforehand, Mr. Verrall. It’s good you’re getting things checked out. So, just to clarify – you're hoping to start a family with a partner, and you want to assess your overall health and fertility, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that is right. Fertility… is that what you call it? I don’t… I don’t really know all the words. I just want to make sure… everything is good. I am… older, you see. Not getting any younger. I want to be… a good… father. If… if things work out.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright not to know the terminology, Mr. Verrall. That’s what I’m here for. And you’re right to be proactive about it. Age is a factor, and it’s good you're thinking about this. Let's get some information together. First, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. It’s been… a while. I used to, when I was… working more. Sales Engineers, you see. Lots of travel. Hard to keep appointments. I think… maybe ten years ago? For a check-up. Before that… I don’t really… recall. I had some… aches and pains now and then, but I just… pushed through it. Is that bad? I forget a lot these days.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Verrall, but it's good we're talking about it now. A lot can happen over ten years. And forgetting things can be… normal as we get older, but we’ll want to take that into consideration. Do you have any chronic health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else a doctor has diagnosed you with?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, I don't think so. High blood pressure… maybe? I think the doctor mentioned something about it once, a long time ago. But I don’t… I don’t take any pills for it. Nothing regular. My heart… no, I don’t think so. Just gets a bit… fast when I climb stairs. But I’m not very active these days, to be honest. Mostly just… relaxing. Is that… helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not good at this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. You're doing fine. It's helpful to know what you remember, and we can sort through it together. So, potential high blood pressure in the past, and a bit of shortness of breath with exertion. We will check your blood pressure today to get a current reading. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy… I broke my arm, I think. Playing football. But that was a long time ago. Hospital… yes! When I was travelling, in… Turkey, I think it was. Something I ate, made me very sick. I had to go to the hospital for a couple of days. But it was nothing serious. Just… food poisoning, I think they said. A very bad stomach ache. And… that’s all I can really remember, to be honest. I get a little confused sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, and a bout of food poisoning while traveling. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, grandparents – had any significant health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… difficult. My… my parents are both gone now. And I didn't… I didn't see my siblings very often. We… weren't very close. I think… my mother, she had problems with her… her stomach. But I don't know what kind. And my father… he smoked a lot. Maybe problems with his lungs? I'm not sure. He died quite young, actually. I don't really… remember much about their health, to be honest. It's been a long time. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s common to not have a complete family history. We can work with what you remember. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. No, I don't smoke. Never have. My father… he did, but I always… avoided it. Bad for you, you see. I drink… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing heavy. Just to relax. Not every night, though. A couple of times a week, perhaps. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A couple of glasses of wine a week is relatively moderate. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? No! Absolutely not. Never. I am a… a respectable man. I don’t… I don’t do things like that. I just… enjoy a quiet life. And a glass of wine with my dinner, as I said. That’s all. I’m sorry if that sounds… strange.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Verrall. It doesn't sound strange at all. I just need to ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a… a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes, if I get bitten by a mosquito. But nothing serious. No medications, no foods. I eat… everything, really. I like food! I’m not very fussy. Does that help? I try to remember things, but it’s… difficult sometimes. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. No known allergies is good to know. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, not really. I used to take something for… for my back, a few years ago. But I stopped. It didn’t really help. Vitamins… sometimes, I take a multivitamin. But I forget to be honest. And… that’s all, I think. No, I don’t take any regular pills or anything. Just the occasional multivitamin when I remember. Sorry, I’m not very good at keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general sense of your health. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, please. My back… it gets a bit sore sometimes. But… yes. Go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I haven't done this in… a long time. I used to get a bit… nervous around doctors, to be honest. But you seem… nice. So it's okay. Just let me know if you need me to do anything different.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Mr. Verrall. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, especially when you take a deep breath. This could be due to a number of things, and we’ll want to investigate further if it persists. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/90. This is a little higher than ideal, but not alarming. We’ll monitor it closely. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Please open your mouth and say “Ah.”
PATIENT: Ah… is everything alright? My throat feels a bit… scratchy sometimes. Especially in the morning. I don’t know if that’s… important. Is that what you’re looking for? Everything seems alright, doesn’t it? I’m sorry if I’m being difficult. I just… I worry. About getting older. And… about starting a family. At my age. It’s… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, but there are no signs of infection. The redness is likely due to mild irritation. Everything looks okay so far. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen – your belly – to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please lie back comfortably. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little bit tender, there. On the… left side. Not very bad, but… yes. A little bit sore. I sometimes get… indigestion. Especially if I eat something spicy. Is that what you're feeling? It's probably just that. I worry too much, I think. Just… a bit sensitive. Don't push too hard, please. I’m… not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m being very careful. It's good to know about the indigestion. I'm just checking for any masses or abnormalities. Everything feels relatively normal, but there is some mild tenderness. Finally, I’m going to check your pulse in your feet to make sure your circulation is good. Your pulse is good and strong in both feet. Okay, Mr. Verrall, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but we do have a few things we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, you have some mild crackling in your lungs, and some tenderness in your abdomen. I recommend we start with some blood tests to check your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. We should also get a chest x-ray to evaluate the crackling in your lungs, and a stool test to investigate the abdominal tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a chest x-ray… a stool test… That’s… a lot. Is it… serious? Is something wrong? I just wanted to make sure I was… healthy enough to start a family. I didn’t expect all this. Will it be expensive? I… I don’t have much money. And what about the results? How long will it take? I’m… a bit worried now. I’m sorry. I’m probably being silly. But it’s a lot to take in. Can we just… take it one step at a time? What’s the most important thing we need to do first?
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Mr. Verrall. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. And you're right, let's take it one step at a time. The tests are not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but it’s important to rule out any potential problems. The most important thing right now is the blood tests. They’ll give us a good overall picture of your health and help us decide what next steps to take. Regarding cost, I understand your concern. We can discuss options for affordable testing, including assistance programs and payment plans. I'll have the receptionist help you with that. As for the results, it usually takes 2-3 business days for the blood tests to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that sounds… better. One step at a time. Blood tests first. And you’ll help me with the cost. That’s… a relief. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate it. I’m still a little worried, but… less so. Can I… can I ask one more question? It’s… about my age. Is it… too late? To have a child? I worry about that the most, I think. I don’t want to… disappoint anyone. Or… put a child through something difficult.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid question, Mr. Verrall, and one many people your age ask. It's not too late to have a child, but there are some things we need to consider. As men age, there can be a decline in sperm quality and a slightly increased risk of genetic conditions. However, many men father healthy children well into their 60s and beyond. The blood tests will give us more information about your overall health and reproductive potential. We can also discuss options like sperm analysis to assess sperm quality if necessary. And if you and your partner are considering assisted reproductive technologies, we can refer you to a specialist. The important thing is to be informed and make the best decision for yourselves. I want to assure you that age is not an automatic barrier to fatherhood, and we'll do everything we can to support you through this process. Does that help put your mind at ease a little?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, it does. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve been very kind. And helpful. I feel… a little bit better now. Less scared. So, the blood tests first. And then… we’ll see. I guess we’ll just take it from there. Can you tell me… where do I go for the blood tests? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare? Like… should I fast? Or… avoid anything? I want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. You do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Avoid caffeine as well. We’ll give you a list of specific instructions at the front desk, but that’s the gist of it. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results come back. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. We'll work through this together, Mr. Verrall. Now, let's get you to the lab. Do you need help getting there?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I think I can manage. Just down the hall, you said? Third door on the left. Yes. I remember. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your help. I think… I think I’ll go and get those blood tests done now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. You take care. And don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
