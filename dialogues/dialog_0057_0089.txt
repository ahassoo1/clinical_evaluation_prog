DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to make your acquaintance. Oh dear, what does bring me in… It’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It’s been… troublesome, lately. It comes and goes, and it’s rather severe when it does come. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… well, a condition I have. Something with the letters S… and L… and E? It’s terribly difficult for me to recall things these days, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you can't recall everything; that's what I'm here for. You mentioned pain in your lower abdomen that comes and goes, and you think your previous doctor discussed something with the letters S-L-E?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. S-L-E. It… sounds important, doesn’t it? And they did a lot of tests, I recall. Blood work, mostly. And… something about my joints. It’s all rather hazy, truly. The pain… well, it feels like a deep ache, sometimes, and other times it’s more like… cramping. Quite uncomfortable, especially when I’m trying to rest. Do you… need me to be more specific? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, you’re not rambling. It’s helpful for me to get as much information as possible, and you’re doing great. S-L-E does sound important, and it's very likely your previous doctor was referring to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That's a condition we should definitely explore further. Could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Systemic… Lupus Erythematosus. Yes, that sounds right. It does. A terribly long name! And… yes, exploring it further sounds wise. The pain… hmm. It’s worst, I think, when I’ve been… active. Not strenuous activity, necessarily. Just… being on my feet for a while. Or even sitting for too long, oddly enough. It radiates, sometimes. Down my thighs, a little. And it’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly where it’s coming from. It shifts about. Does that make any sense? I'm afraid I'm not very good at describing these things. It’s just a general… discomfort. A rather insistent one, when it flares up.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Glymph. Lupus can cause pain that shifts around and is often worse with activity or prolonged sitting. It’s very common for patients to describe it as a general discomfort. Do you notice anything else that seems to make the pain worse, or anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… . Warmth seems to help, I believe. A warm bath, or a heating pad. Not too hot, of course, but a gentle warmth. And… lying very still. Though even that doesn’t always work, sadly. Worse… well, stress, certainly. When I’m feeling anxious or… unsettled, it seems to amplify everything. And… cold weather. The damp cold, especially. That always seems to aggravate it. I also find… certain foods seem to upset my stomach, which then makes the abdominal pain worse. Though I haven’t been able to pinpoint which foods, exactly. It’s all rather… unpredictable, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Glymph. The connection to stress, cold weather, and potential food sensitivities is consistent with Lupus. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other symptoms you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any fatigue, skin rashes, joint pain or swelling, fever, or any changes in your hair or weight?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a long list. Fatigue… yes, quite a lot of fatigue. I often feel… drained, even after a full night’s sleep. It's not the sort of tiredness that a cup of tea can fix, you understand. Skin rashes… I have noticed some redness on my cheeks, occasionally. It comes and goes. And… yes, my joints do ache. My hands, mostly. And my wrists. Not constant swelling, but they feel… stiff and achy, particularly in the mornings. Fever… I don't recall having a high fever, but I often feel… warm to the touch. And… yes, my hair has been thinning, I believe. Though I thought that was just… getting older. And… no significant weight changes, not that I've noticed. Is that… helpful? I'm afraid I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, you are not rambling at all. That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Glymph, and consistent with a possible Lupus diagnosis. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… Well, as you know, the… Lupus. That’s the main thing. And… I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia several years ago, I believe. It took a long time to recover from. And… I have a touch of high blood pressure, I think. My previous physician prescribed some medication for it. A small pill, taken daily. Other than that… not much, I don’t believe. I've always been relatively… healthy, despite the Lupus. It’s just… this pain has been particularly troublesome lately. I hope that's useful. Are we getting closer to understanding what’s happening?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very useful, Ms. Glymph. Thank you. Knowing about the pneumonia and high blood pressure is important. And it's good to know you've been managing the Lupus for some time. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, and do you remember the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you're asking about specifics. . Let me see… The pill is… small and white, I believe. And… it's taken once daily, with breakfast. As for the dosage… that’s terribly difficult for me to recall. I have a small pill organizer, at home, that might have the information on it. I believe it begins with an “A”… Amlodipine, perhaps? Is that right? I'm terribly sorry I'm not more helpful. My memory is simply not what it used to be. I do see my physician regularly for refills, so it must be the correct medication. Would it be easier to simply look it up in my records?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It’s much easier to check your records. Okay, I see here that you are currently taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure. And I confirm a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, Amlodipine 5mg, yes! That sounds right, thank you for confirming. Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Nothing major, thankfully. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, I believe. And… I had a small cyst removed from my wrist several years ago. It wasn’t a terribly invasive procedure. Just a small incision and a few stitches. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. I’ve always been rather lucky in that regard. I do try to avoid hospitals whenever possible. They’re not my favorite place, you understand. Is that all the questions you have for me? I feel like I'm taking up a great deal of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you are not taking up too much of my time at all, Ms. Glymph. That information is very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a bit of a tricky one. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. Quite severe arthritis, in her hands and knees. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, had some sort of… autoimmune condition, I think. It wasn’t Lupus, but something similar. I’m not entirely sure what it was. She was always quite private about her health. Other than that… not much that I recall. My father was remarkably healthy, well into his eighties. And my siblings… they’ve both been quite fortunate in that regard as well. Is that… helpful? I do apologize if my memory is failing me again. It’s terribly frustrating, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Glymph. A family history of arthritis and another autoimmune condition is significant. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no smoking, thank you very much. Never have, never will. And… very little alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on occasion. But nothing excessive, I assure you. And… absolutely no recreational drugs. I’ve always been a rather… sensible person, you see. I do enjoy a good book, and a quiet evening at home. And… gardening, when the weather permits. Is that… the sort of information you were looking for? I hope I’m not being too tedious.
DOCTOR: No, not at all tedious, Ms. Glymph. That’s helpful to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I believe I had a mild reaction to penicillin when I was a child. A small rash, I think. Other than that… no significant allergies, to my knowledge. I don’t have any known food allergies. And… I haven’t had any reactions to any of the medications I’ve taken in the past. Though, as you know, my memory isn’t always reliable. I do try to be careful, though. I always inform my physician of any medications I’m taking, and I always read the labels carefully. Is there anything else you need to know? I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Glymph, I think that covers everything. Thank you for providing such a thorough history. Okay, based on everything you’ve told me, your current symptoms, your history of Lupus, and your family history, it sounds like you may be experiencing a Lupus flare-up. Your fatigue, joint pain, rash, and abdominal pain are all consistent with this. I’d like to perform a physical exam now, if you don’t mind, to assess your joints, skin, and abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A flare-up… that sounds… plausible, I suppose. It certainly would explain things. A physical exam… yes, that’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m… rather accustomed to examinations, you see. I’ve had a few over the years. Just… be gentle, if you would. My joints are rather sensitive at the moment. And… I do apologize if I flinch. It’s not intentional, you understand. Just… a bit of a nervous habit. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. I'll let you know what I’m doing as I go. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72, your temperature is 98.6, and your respiration rate is 16. That's within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to examine your joints. I notice some mild tenderness in your wrists, but no significant swelling or redness. Your range of motion is slightly limited. Your knees feel stable, with no tenderness or swelling. Now, I'm going to examine your abdomen. I notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no masses or organomegaly. Finally, I'm going to examine your skin. I notice a mild rash on your cheeks, consistent with a malar rash. Based on my physical exam, your symptoms and history, it is likely you are experiencing a Lupus flare-up. To confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That all… sounds quite logical, Doctor. A flare-up does seem to be the most plausible explanation, given everything. The tenderness in my wrists and the rash on my cheeks… yes, those have been particularly troublesome. Blood tests… yes, of course. That would be perfectly alright. Anything that might help to determine the cause and find a suitable treatment… I’m all for it. What sort of tests are you thinking of? I’m not terribly knowledgeable about these things, you see. And… are they painful? I do have a rather… low tolerance for needles, I’m afraid. But I’ll do whatever is necessary. Just… please let me know beforehand what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I understand your concern about the needles. The blood tests are not terribly painful, but you may feel a brief pinch. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check your overall blood health, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to check for inflammation, and an antinuclear antibody test to look for antibodies associated with Lupus. We may also want to check specific Lupus antibodies, like anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies, if the ANA test is positive. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: A complete blood count… a comprehensive metabolic panel… erythrocyte sedimentation rate… Oh dear. Those are rather… long names. It sounds like quite a comprehensive list. Yes, that all sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. As long as it might help to determine the cause and find a suitable treatment, I’m willing to undergo whatever tests are necessary. The needles… well, I’ll try to brave it. And… thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It does help to know what to expect. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any special preparations I need to make before the tests? Or… any dietary restrictions? I do hope it doesn’t involve fasting. I haven’t had breakfast yet, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I understand your concern about the tests. For these blood tests, you don’t need to fast. You can eat and drink as usual. However, it's best to avoid strenuous exercise for at least 24 hours before the tests. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It will take just a few minutes. You may feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. After the blood draw, you may have a small bruise at the injection site. I will order the tests now, and the lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No fasting… that’s a relief. And no special preparations… that’s wonderful. I can certainly avoid strenuous exercise. A small bruise… I can manage that. No, I don’t believe I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly, and you’ve been so patient with my… forgetfulness. I do appreciate it very much. I shall await the lab technician’s call, and I shall contact you immediately if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. It’s… reassuring to know that I’m in such capable hands. I believe that is all for today. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. Get well soon, Ms. Glymph.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Good day.
