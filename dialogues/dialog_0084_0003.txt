DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, it's this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happenin’ for a bit now, and it’s gettin’ on my nerves. I got things to do, you know? Don't have time for this. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Old age, right?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if you think it might be something minor. We want to rule things out. “A bit now” – can you tell me roughly how long it’s been happening?
PATIENT: Roughly? Jeez, Doc, you and these questions. Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my tremors. Maybe…six months? A little more? It comes and goes, see? Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times…well, it's annoying. I used to be able to hold a glass steady, now…not so much. It’s just…frustrating. Now, can we hurry this up? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, comes and goes, and affecting your ability to hold things steady. I appreciate you telling me. Let's try to get a better picture of it. Does anything specific seem to trigger the shaking, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Look, I'm an old man, alright? Things just…happen. Stress, maybe? Being tired? Honestly, it doesn't feel like there's a pattern. I used to be able to handle anything. Directing a film, all those people…now this. It’s…demeaning, frankly. Don’t you have something that can just…stop it? Some kind of pill? I don’t need a whole life story about it, just fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and wanting a quick solution. We will try to get to the bottom of this. It’s important to understand why it’s happening before we start any treatment. Do you notice the shaking when you're resting, or only when you're trying to do something – like using your hands?
PATIENT: Resting? Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t usually sit and stare at my hand, Doc. I'm a busy man, or was. But…I think it's worse when I try to do something. Like…writing, or using a fork. Holding a glass, like I said. Definitely worse then. Look, I used to have steady hands. That's all you need to know. Don't you doctors have tests for these things? Get on with it. I have a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more noticeable with activity. That’s helpful. Yes, we do. I'd like to do a quick neurological exam – just some simple tests to check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. It won’t take long. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests. Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. But make it quick, alright? I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded. And please, no bright lights. My eyes aren't what they used to be. Let's just do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. If you could sit here for me. We'll start with your reflexes. I'll just gently tap on your knees and ankles. Then, I’ll ask you to do a few simple movements – things like touching your nose with your finger, and walking a short distance. I'll also check your balance. No bright lights, I promise. Okay, reflexes are…a little diminished on both sides, but not significantly. Coordination…slightly impaired in your right hand. And your gait…a slight tremor is present when walking, and a bit of slowness. Could you extend your arms in front of you, palms up, for a moment?
PATIENT: There. Happy? See? Shaking. It's always worse when I hold them out like this. Honestly, it's embarrassing. I used to be so…precise. Everything had to be perfect. Now look at me. Now, what does it mean? Don't tell me it’s something terrible. I'm too old for terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the tremor. It appears to be a resting tremor, more pronounced on your right side. And it does seem to lessen when you're moving your arm. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it could be indicative of essential tremor, or possibly Parkinson's disease. However, it’s too early to make a diagnosis. To be certain, I'd like to order a few blood tests to rule out other potential causes. And I think a referral to a neurologist would be very helpful. They can perform more specialized tests and give us a definitive answer. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Parkinson's? Don't be ridiculous. I'm not that old. And a neurologist? More doctors? More tests? Honestly, this is a waste of time. I just want something to stop the shaking, not a whole medical investigation. Can't you just give me something? A pill, an injection, anything? Look, I’ve lived a long life, I don't need a label. Just fix it. Now. Is that so much to ask? I have a lunch appointment, you know! I’m losing daylight.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and your desire for a quick solution. But it's important to find the right solution, and that requires a proper diagnosis. Giving you medication without knowing the cause could potentially mask other issues or even worsen the problem. There are medications that can help manage tremors, but they’re tailored to the specific condition causing it. That’s why I strongly recommend the blood tests and the referral to a neurologist. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to make things a little easier. Using adaptive tools – like weighted silverware or a glass with a wider base – can sometimes help. And occupational therapy might be beneficial to help you find strategies to manage the tremors in your daily life. Would you be willing to consider those options while we wait for the results of the tests and the neurologist appointment?
PATIENT: Weighted silverware? Occupational therapy? Honestly, this is getting absurd. I’m a director, not a…craftsman! But…fine. Fine! Do your tests. Send me to your neurologist. But if I have to spend all day waiting around in waiting rooms and getting poked and prodded, I'm holding you responsible, Doc. This better be worth my time. And don’t expect me to thank you. Now, about that lunch…can I go? I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I'll get the lab order for the blood tests sent to the lab right away, and I’ll get a referral to a neurologist scheduled for you. They'll contact you directly to set up an appointment. I'll also have the nurse print out some information about adaptive tools and occupational therapy for you to review. Yes, you can absolutely go. I'll let you get on with your day. I understand your frustration, and we'll do our best to get this sorted out quickly. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your neurologist appointment. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Baide. .
