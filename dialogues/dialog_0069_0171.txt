DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, hi. It's... my nails. They just look... funny. I don't even know why I’m here, really. They changed, okay? That's all. Not a big deal, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. They’ve changed in appearance, and that’s concerning you. That's a perfectly valid reason to come in. Can you tell me a little more about how they've changed?
PATIENT: Changed... how? Like, color? Maybe. They’re not… bright, if that makes sense. Just… different. I don't really look at my hands, you know? I use them, but I don’t see them. It's hard to explain. They're not broken or anything. Just… off.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to describe changes when you don't routinely observe them. "Off" is a good way to put it. Have you noticed any changes in the shape of your nails at all?
PATIENT: Shape? Hmm… I dunno. They’re… still nails. Longish, I guess. I used to get them… done. A long time ago. Not now. Too much trouble. They haven't gotten, like, really long or anything. Just… normal nail shapes. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, normal shape. Have you noticed any ridges, pits, or thickening of the nails?
PATIENT: Ridges… Maybe a little bit bumpy? Not smooth, for sure. But bumpy like… old nails, you know? I don't paint them, so they’re not supposed to be smooth. Is that what you mean? Thickening… no. They're not… fat. Just… nails.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unevenness or ridging, but no thickening. And you said the color is different, but not bright?
PATIENT: Yeah, not bright. Kinda… dull. Like they haven't seen the sun. Or, not like they need the sun. Just... not shiny. And maybe a little… yellow? I don’t know. I’m not good at colors. My sister was the pretty one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull appearance with maybe a slight yellow tinge. Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Uh… dry, maybe? It's always kinda dry. I use lotion sometimes. Not regular, though. When I remember. No… redness or anything. It doesn’t hurt. Just… normal dry skin. Old lady skin, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, some dryness around the nails, but no redness or pain. Now, have you noticed any changes to your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Overall health… I feel… okay. Tired, but who isn’t? I eat… food. Sometimes I forget to drink enough water. Not much changes, really. I don’t go out much. And I definitely haven't been sick. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any medications currently, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… Just the stuff for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And… oh, sometimes something for my knees when they bother me. That's it. Allergies… I don't think so. I mean, I like cats, so probably not. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the cats! So, medication for blood pressure and sometimes for your knees. Do you happen to know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Names… Ugh, no. I just… take them. My daughter fills the little thing every month. She handles all that stuff. It's… a white one for the pressure, and a yellow one for the knees. That’s all I know. I’m not good with remembering things. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can look those up in your records. Alright, it looks like you’re currently taking Lisinopril for blood pressure and Naproxen as needed for knee pain. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisin… something? Naproxen… Yeah, those sound right. She always says long words. It's good she handles it, honestly. I’d probably forget to take them if I had to remember the names too.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Naproxen. And you mentioned some fatigue. Is that new, or has that been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the tired? Forever, probably. I mean, I'm not a young woman anymore, am I? It's just… always a bit tired. Not like, can’t get out of bed tired, just… a little sluggish. It's been worse lately, maybe? I don’t know. Everything feels a little… blurrier than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, ongoing fatigue that might be slightly worse recently, and some general blurriness. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to take a look at your nails more closely, check your vital signs, and listen to your heart and lungs. It'll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. Not important things, but things. Hurry up though, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92, but that’s not unexpected given your history. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, regarding your nails… I do see some ridging and a slight yellow discoloration, as you mentioned. The texture seems a bit brittle. I’m also noticing some slight clubbing of the nail beds, which means the angle where the nail meets your skin is a little wider than normal. This is something we'll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Clubbing? What does that mean? Is something wrong? Don’t tell me it’s something terrible. I don’t do well with terrible.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean something terrible, Ms. Thut. Clubbing can be associated with a few different things, and it's often benign. It simply means the shape of your nail beds has changed. However, it can be a sign of underlying lung or heart conditions, which is why we want to investigate it further. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Fine. Whatever you think. Just… hurry up, okay? I don't like being poked and prodded. And don't tell me anything too scary, alright? I get enough scary news as it is. Chest X-ray… that sounds bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. A chest X-ray is a standard imaging test, and it doesn’t involve any poking or prodding – it's just a quick scan of your lungs. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and help rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. I'll have the lab draw those for you right away, and then we'll schedule the chest X-ray. In the meantime, it's important to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Would you like me to print out instructions for you regarding the lab tests?
PATIENT: Instructions… yeah, that would be good. I always forget things. And… can you tell my daughter, maybe? She’ll know what to do with them. I just… get confused. But don’t tell her anything scary either, alright? She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are the instructions for the lab tests. I'll make a note to let your daughter know when the results are available, and we can discuss them together. I will also write a note for her about your concerns, and emphasize that we are just being thorough at this stage. To recap, we've ordered a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. We'll schedule the X-ray for you as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… when will I know something? I don’t want to wait forever. And… will it hurt? The tests, the X-ray… everything. I hate needles. And I hate waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Thut. The lab results usually come back within a few business days. We'll contact you as soon as we have them. The chest X-ray is completely painless, it just involves standing still for a few moments while the image is taken. As for needles, I can let the phlebotomist know you're anxious, and they can take extra care to make you comfortable. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant fatigue, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that's everything. Just… don’t scare me, okay? And thank you. For not yelling at me for not knowing things. Most doctors do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Thut. I understand it can be overwhelming to remember everything, and I’m happy to take the time to explain things clearly. I promise I won't scare you, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in touch to schedule your chest X-ray. Have a good day, Ms. Thut, and please try to relax. .
