DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s… unpleasant. Something’s going on in my mouth. It’s white, and it's… bothersome. I haven't much time for this, to be frank.
DOCTOR: "Unpleasant" and "bothersome" aren’t terribly helpful, Mr. Schieber. I understand you’re busy, but I need specifics to actually help you. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Not… exactly painful. More… irritating. Like a constant film. And it's unsightly, naturally. I assure you, a man in my position doesn’t want to be bothered with… that. Is this going to take long? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Right. “Unsightly.” Well, let’s try to figure out what it is, then. Is this white film all over your mouth, or is it in a specific area?
PATIENT: Mostly on my tongue. And… the insides of my cheeks, a bit. It’s not… widespread, thankfully. I keep it meticulously clean, you understand. I assure you it’s not a matter of hygiene.
DOCTOR: Meticulously clean, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite meticulous. I brush after every meal. And I use a mouthwash. A very good one, imported. It’s… unfortunate this has happened, given my routine. Frankly, I suspect it's something I've caught from someone else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first notice this… film?
PATIENT: Oh, a few days ago, I suppose. Perhaps a week. It's difficult to say precisely. Time… slips away. It’s not something I’ve been actively monitoring, Doctor. It’s just… there. It’s distracting, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Distracting how?
PATIENT: Well, the taste, naturally. It’s… unpleasant. And it’s visible when I speak. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. It’s hardly conducive to business when one is self-conscious about such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Let’s take a look. Open wide, please. And try to relax. I need a good look at your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. It’s not going to be a pleasant experience, but it's necessary.
PATIENT: Just… be quick about it, Doctor. I haven’t got all day. And please, try not to poke too hard. It's quite sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. There is a white coating on the tongue, as you described. Some mild erythema on the buccal mucosa. No obvious lesions or ulcers. The coating appears to be… removable. Not thrush, then. Doesn't look like lichen planus either. It’s not particularly inflamed, but the coating is substantial. Do you smoke, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, are you suggesting… No! Absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I exercise regularly, I eat a balanced diet. Smoking is… barbaric. It’s a dreadful habit, frankly. I assure you, it’s not that. It must be something I’ve contracted. Perhaps from a poorly cleaned glass at a restaurant?
DOCTOR: Right. A poorly cleaned glass. Well, it could be a number of things. Given your… meticulous hygiene, and lack of other symptoms, my initial thought is geographic tongue, though it usually presents differently. It could also be a simple case of fissured tongue with secondary coating. Do you notice any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? No. I eat the same things, Doctor. Always. Grilled fish, steamed vegetables, a small portion of rice. Nothing… exotic. I’m not one for experimentation. This is most peculiar. It’s terribly inconvenient, you understand. Is there not some medication you can simply prescribe to make it go away? I haven’t the time for extensive diagnostics.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your frustration. But I don't prescribe medications based on… inconvenience. We need to determine the cause of this coating before we treat it. I recommend improving your oral hydration, avoiding irritating foods - spicy or acidic things. And perhaps a gentle tongue scraper. We can rule out more serious causes by a dietary change and improved oral care. If it doesn’t improve in a week, then we can consider further investigation. A referral to a dentist is also a possibility. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A week? Very well. A week. But if it doesn’t improve, Doctor, I expect a prompt referral. I haven’t the patience for this. And frankly, I believe I should be compensated for my time. This is a considerable disruption to my schedule. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. I'll make a note of your concerns. I’ll also document the plan in your chart. Please schedule a follow-up appointment if it doesn't improve.
