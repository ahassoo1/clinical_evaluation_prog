DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’ll be your physician today. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Glowka, yes? Nice to meet you too. My husband, he say I need paper… for the place. The senior place. They want to make sure I am… okay for live there? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like they need a medical evaluation form completed for admission to the senior living facility. Absolutely, we can certainly do that for you today. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Recently… not much. I get tired, sometimes. Old age, you know? My knees, they bother me when is cold. And… I forget things. Not big things. Just… where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. Is normal, I think. My husband worry too much. He say I should see doctor.
DOCTOR: It's very good of your husband to be attentive to your health, Ms. Abdollahi. It's completely normal to experience changes as we get older. Fatigue, some joint discomfort, and occasional forgetfulness are all common. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Is… like a weight. All the time. Not every minute, but most days. I sleep okay, I think. Eight hours, maybe? But when I wake up… still tired. Is hard to do things. Even… making the coffee. Things take longer. Is not… sick tired. Just… heavy tired. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Ms. Abdollahi. That "heavy tired" feeling is a very good way to describe it. It's helpful to know it’s not a sick feeling, but more of a consistent lack of energy. And you mentioned your knees bother you when it’s cold. Is that a sharp pain, or more of an ache?
PATIENT: Is ache. Not sharp. More… deep. Like the bones are cold. When is rain, is bad. And in the morning, before I move around. Then, after I walk a little… is better. Not gone, but… not so bad. I put cream on, sometimes. The one my daughter buy for me. Is help a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, an ache that's deeper, and worse in the cold and mornings. That’s good information. The cream helping is also good to know. Now, you mentioned some forgetfulness. Could you give me an example of what you've been experiencing, beyond misplacing your glasses or what you had for breakfast?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I forget the name of… of the nice lady at the store. You know, the one with the red hair? I see her every week! And… last week, I tried to make my special soup. But I… I forget what goes in it! My husband, he had to remind me. Is embarrassing. Is not… important things. But… still. Is there.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's mostly with recalling names and sometimes recipes – things that aren't necessarily essential, but certainly can be frustrating. It's perfectly normal to be concerned about memory changes, and it's good you're sharing this with me. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, I'd like to ask a few more general questions about your health, if you don’t mind. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… the gallbladder, a long time ago. Maybe… thirty years? And… I break my arm when I was young. Fall from the tree! Stupid thing. But that is all, I think. Nothing else important. No… sickness, like the flu, for many years. I am lucky, maybe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Abdollahi. Gallbladder surgery about thirty years ago and a broken arm as a child. And you haven't been significantly ill with things like the flu in many years. That is good. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he worry about salt, but… I like salt! And I take… a little pill for my blood pressure. The white one. But that is all. No… rashes. No trouble breathing. Nothing like that. I am very… plain, I think. No problems.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Abdollahi. No known allergies and just a medication for your blood pressure. That simplifies things nicely. Do you mind telling me the name of that blood pressure medication, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh… that is hard. My husband, he give me the pills. I just take them. Is… small white one. Bottle is blue. He get it from the… the drugstore? Is a long name. I not remember. I sorry. My memory… is bad, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Don't worry about it at all. We can easily look up the medication in the system. It’s common to not remember specific names. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family's health?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she live long life. Ninety years, maybe? She have… the sugar sickness. And her heart, was not so good. My father, he have… the pains in his legs. He walk slow. And… my sister, she have the troubles with her breathing. But that is all I remember. Is long time ago. Not much healthy people in my family, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had diabetes and some heart problems, your father had issues with his legs, and your sister had breathing problems. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoke. Never. My husband, he try one time, when he was young, but he stop. He say is bad for the health. I always say no. Never like the smoke. Make me cough. Very bad. No smoke.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi. Very good. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh… sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner. Very little. Not every day. Maybe… two times a week? It help me relax. My husband, he drink a little too, but not much. We like the red wine. Is from… Chile, sometimes. Is good wine. But not too much. Is not a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of red wine a couple of times a week. That's good to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let me ask you a few final questions. Are you currently experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Sometimes. In my knees, you know? When is cold. And… my back, a little. Old age, you know? Is not… sharp pain. Just… ache. I take the cream, sometimes. And I try to walk a little, every day. Keep moving. Is better when I move. But sometimes… is there. Is not bad, Doctor. I can live with it.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Ms. Abdollahi. Ache in your knees and back, especially with the cold, and improved with movement. Now, one last question before we proceed with the physical exam. Do you have any difficulty with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… my vision is not so good. I wear glasses, you see? I need them for read. And for see far. But is okay. I have them. My hearing… maybe a little. My husband, he talk louder sometimes. But maybe is him! Is hard to hear everything, when is noisy. But is not… bad. I can hear you okay. Is just… little hard sometimes. Old age, you know? Is normal.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Abdollahi. Some difficulty with vision and hearing is common with age. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Thank you for answering all my questions. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam now, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Whatever you need. Is good. You are very nice. I am ready. Just… is not too cold in here, yes? My bones… feel cold sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Abdollahi. I want you to be comfortable. We can definitely warm up the room a bit. Here's a gown for you to change into. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Then we can check your reflexes, and palpate your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound good. I change now. Tell me… will you find out why I forget things? Is that possible? My husband worry so much. He say maybe is the beginning of… of something bad. I not want… something bad. Just want to remember where I put my glasses!
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Ms. Abdollahi. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of your memory concerns. There are many reasons why someone might experience forgetfulness, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We'll assess your overall health and cognitive function, and if needed, we can discuss further testing or specialist referral. Please take your time changing, and I'll be right back to start the exam once you're ready. I'll make sure the room is comfortably warm for you. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I will change now. I hope you find my glasses too!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, are you ready when we are?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Is cold in here now, a little. But is okay. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, I'm going to take your blood pressure now. Relax your arm for me, please. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Now, let's listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular. I’m detecting a slight murmur, which is not uncommon in people your age, but we’ll note it. Now I'm going to listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Is okay. You press hard, a little. But is not pain. Just… feel. That is all. The murmur… is that bad? My husband, he worry about everything. He say his mother, she have the murmur, and… and she was very sick. Is that the same?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know there's no pain. As for the murmur, it’s important to understand that murmurs can vary greatly in significance. Many are completely harmless and require no treatment. However, it's good that we've noted it. We'll keep an eye on it. It doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as your husband's mother’s condition. Each case is unique. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear. Now, open your mouth for me, and say “Ah.” Your throat looks clear as well. No signs of infection. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. This just means I'm going to gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No discomfort. I feel… your hand, a little. But is not pain. Just… feel. Is my stomach okay? I eat a lot of beans, sometimes. Maybe that is the problem? My husband, he say beans give you… the gas. Is that bad for the stomach?
DOCTOR: Your abdomen feels soft, and I don't detect any tenderness. It's perfectly normal to feel gas from beans, and it's not harmful, though it can certainly be uncomfortable! It doesn't indicate any problem with your stomach. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be within normal limits for your age, with the slight murmur and diminished reflexes being common findings. Now, do you have a list of any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the little white pill for the blood pressure. That is all. I think. My daughter, she sometimes give me something for my knees. But is not every day. Is a little green capsule. I forget the name. She say it is good for the joints. Is from the store. Not the doctor. I not remember the name. Is okay, Doctor. I not take much medicine. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like you generally stay healthy, and the little white pill for blood pressure is your only regular medication, plus the occasional green capsule for your knees. I will ask my nurse to check the EHR to see if we can identify the green capsule. Now, let's talk about your memory concerns. I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment. It will just involve answering some simple questions and completing a few tasks. It will help me get a better understanding of your current cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. I try my best. But… I forget things, you know? I worry I will make a fool of myself. My husband, he say I always do! But… I want to know what is wrong. So… yes. I will try. Just… be patient with me, yes?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Abdollahi. I will absolutely be patient with you. This is not a test, and there are no right or wrong answers. It’s simply a way for me to get a better understanding of your cognitive function. We’ll take it at your own pace. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Is… August? Yes. August… the second? I think. Yes. August the second. 20…25? Is that right? I always get the years mixed up. Is hard to remember. But yes, I think. August the second, 2025. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That's very good, Ms. Abdollahi. Yes, today is August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm… oh dear. Is… is a big city. I not remember the name. We come here for the… the senior place? Is near… the park? I forget. Is embarrassing. My husband, he knows everything. He drive here. Is a big city, Doctor. I sorry. I really forget.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It's understandable to forget things sometimes. We are in Chicago, Illinois. It's alright that you don’t recall. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and then I’ll ask you to remember them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. But… I worry. My memory… is bad. But I will try my best. Just… say them slow, yes? And… maybe write them down? For me? Just in case? Please?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Abdollahi. Here you are. I will say the words slowly, and you can look at the paper if you need to. The words are: apple, table, penny. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, and then I’ll ask you to recall those three words. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound okay. Apple… table… penny. I repeat them. Apple, table, penny. Is… a fruit. And… something you eat on. And… a little money. I hope I remember. Is very scary, forget things. My mother… she forget everything at the end. I not want that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. We'll take things one step at a time. You’ve done very well repeating the words. Now, can you tell me what year the United States declared independence?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a long time ago. Is a number… with a lot of… zeros? I think. My husband, he knows history. He read a lot of books. Is before… 1900? Maybe 1776? I think I heard that number before. Is that right? I am guessing. Is very hard.
DOCTOR: That’s a good guess, Ms. Abdollahi. Yes, the United States declared independence in 1776. Now, let’s return to the three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you tell me those three words again?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I forget. Is… something red? And… something to put things on. And… small money. I not remember the names. I am sorry, Doctor. I really, really forget. I am a fool.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It's not at all foolish to forget things, especially when you’re feeling anxious. It's not a test, and it's common to have difficulty recalling things. Based on this brief assessment, it appears you are experiencing some mild memory impairment. However, it's difficult to determine the exact cause without further evaluation. It could be due to a number of factors, including age, stress, or other underlying medical conditions. I recommend we order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems that could be contributing to your memory loss. We may also consider a more comprehensive cognitive assessment and potentially a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound good. Blood work… and… and the other tests. Whatever you think. I just want to know what is wrong. I worry… Is it… the beginning of something bad? Like my mother? I not want to be like my mother. Please… help me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. It’s important to remember that memory loss can have many causes, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll start with the blood work, and then we’ll discuss the results and determine the next steps. I will also write a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Ramirez, who is a specialist in cognitive disorders. He can perform a more comprehensive assessment and provide you with a more detailed diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound… good. Dr. Ramirez? I will see him. And… the blood work. Whatever you think. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Is nice to have someone… listen to me. My husband, he worry so much… he not listen. He just tell me I forget things. You… you understand. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It's my job to listen and help you understand what's going on. I understand your concerns and I'm glad I can help. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She will explain the process and answer any questions you may have. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Before you leave, I’ll also write a note for the senior living facility, outlining your medical history and current condition. Would you like a copy for yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. A copy for me. And… thank you again. You are very nice. Is good to know you are here. I worry about going to the senior place… but maybe… maybe is good. I get tired, you know? And… maybe they can help me remember things. Maybe. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s wonderful that you're considering the senior living facility. It's a good step to take if you're feeling tired and need some extra support. They can certainly provide you with a safe and comfortable environment, and they may also have programs to help with memory and cognitive function. I will also write a note to Dr. Ramirez to inform him of your concerns and the results of our assessment. He will be in touch to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. You answer everything. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Is nice to meet you. And… thank you for listening. Maybe… maybe I will remember my glasses now.
DOCTOR: We’ll take good care of you, Ms. Abdollahi. .
