DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… feeling full awful quick when I eat. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I could burst. It's been going on for… oh, I don't know, maybe a month or so now? It's just getting bothersome, you know? Makes enjoying a good meal pretty hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Obarr. That sounds quite frustrating. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, is certainly bothersome. About a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It didn't start all at once, you know? It was gradual. First just noticing I wasn't as hungry, then a little bit of food filled me up, and now… well, now it's like I can barely get through a bowl of soup. My wife, Elsie, she keeps telling me I should get it checked out. She's probably right, honestly.
DOCTOR: Elsie sounds like a very wise woman. It's good you came in. Gradual onset is helpful to know. Now, can you describe the feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not painful, exactly. More like… pressure, right under my ribs. And it just… stops me. Like there's no room. It's not like heartburn or indigestion, though. It's… different. Hard to explain, really. Just… full. And it stays full for a long time, even if I don't eat much. Like the food just sits there.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure under the ribs, not painful, but a sensation of being full very quickly and that fullness lingering for a long time. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. Not like sick-tired, just… worn out quicker. And maybe a little bit of… well, Elsie says I've been a bit grumpy. She's probably right about that too! I haven't really noticed anything else, not that I can think of. No nausea, no vomiting, no changes in… well, you know. Everything else is working alright, thankfully.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of that, Mr. Obarr. Fatigue and a bit of grumpiness can certainly be associated with various things. And it’s good to know you haven’t experienced nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your bowel habits. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of a bad cold when I was a kid, and I broke my arm falling out of a tree once, but that's about it. Elsie's always been healthy as a horse too. We haven't really been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. We try to stay active, eat alright… well, used to eat alright, before this started. I don't think there's anything in my past that would be important, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a surgery. Elsie had her tonsils out when she was young, but that was a long time ago. I've always managed to avoid the knife, thankfully. I don’t like the thought of it much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries either. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of fish oil, for my joints. Elsie says it's good for them, and they do ache a bit sometimes. And I take a baby aspirin every day, Doctor told me to years ago, just in case. That's it, though. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, fish oil and a daily baby aspirin. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. Elsie's a bit sensitive to some flowers, makes her sneeze a lot in the spring, but I don't have any allergies myself. I think I'm pretty lucky that way, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Obarr. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he didn’t live to be very old, so I always stayed away from them. Elsie doesn't smoke either. Always been a pretty clean living family, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy. Elsie and I used to have a bit more when we were younger, but we've slowed down quite a bit these days. It's mostly just a habit now, really. We don't go out drinking or anything like that. A little bit of red wine with the salmon on Fridays, that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine occasionally. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother lived to be 92, but I don't really know much about her side of the family. My father… well, he died when I was young. Elsie's family… her mother had some trouble with her heart, I think. And her brother had diabetes. That's about all I can remember, really. It wasn't something we talked about much. It's all a bit fuzzy now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. History of heart trouble in Elsie’s mother and diabetes in her brother. Alright, Mr. Obarr, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently palpate your abdomen to see if we can identify any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding if it helps figure things out. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Okay. And now I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain anywhere. I'm not feeling any significant tenderness at this time. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild fullness in the upper quadrants. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm also going to check your weight. Your weight is 54 kilograms, which is 119 pounds. Given your height, that places you at a somewhat low body weight. Now, let's discuss some potential causes for your symptoms and next steps. I'm concerned about the early fullness and your weight. While it’s good that you don't have any acute pain, we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That's… that's about right, my weight. I've always been a bit on the skinny side. Elsie worries about it, keeps trying to get me to eat more. But I don't have much of an appetite, especially now. So, what do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good Elsie is looking out for you, and your weight is something we’ll keep in mind. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but based on your symptoms and the exam, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be something relatively minor like gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. However, given the early fullness and your weight, we need to rule out more serious conditions like early satiety associated with certain gastrointestinal issues, or even a potential malignancy. I don’t want to cause undue alarm, Mr. Obarr, but it's important to be thorough. To help us get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to rule out any bleeding or infection. Additionally, given your early satiety, I think an upper endoscopy would be the most appropriate next step to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. Endoscopy? That sounds… serious. What does that involve? And bleeding? Now you're really scaring me, Doctor. I just came in because I get full after a few bites of food, not because I'm dying! Can't we try something else first? Maybe some medicine or something?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask questions and express your concerns, Mr. Obarr. I apologize if I’ve caused you any alarm. It’s my job to be thorough and to consider all possibilities, but I should have explained things more clearly and started with less invasive options. An endoscopy does sound frightening, but it's the best way to directly visualize what’s happening in your upper digestive tract. It involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It’s typically performed under sedation, so you wouldn't feel any discomfort. We can also take small biopsies during the procedure if needed to examine the tissue under a microscope. Before we jump to an endoscopy, let’s start with some less invasive tests. We can begin with the CBC and CMP to get a baseline assessment of your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We can also discuss a trial of a proton pump inhibitor medication, which helps reduce stomach acid and may alleviate your symptoms. If the PPI doesn’t provide relief, or if the blood tests reveal any abnormalities, then we can revisit the possibility of an endoscopy. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better. Starting with the blood tests and some medicine seems reasonable. I don't want any poking and prodding if we don't have to. And if the medicine helps, well, that would be wonderful. What kind of side effects does that medicine have? I don't want to trade one problem for another.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Obarr, and I'm glad we've found a plan you're comfortable with. The medication I’m referring to is a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. Common brand names include omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole. They're generally very well-tolerated, but like any medication, they can have some side effects. The most common side effects are mild and include headache, diarrhea, or constipation. In rare cases, long-term use of PPIs has been linked to a slightly increased risk of certain infections, like pneumonia or C. difficile colitis, but this risk is generally low. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any bothersome side effects, we can adjust the dose or switch to a different medication. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks to assess your response to the treatment and discuss the blood test results. Now, I'll write you a prescription for omeprazole 20mg once daily, to be taken 30 minutes before a meal. I’ll also give you a lab requisition form for the blood tests. Do you have any questions about the medication or the blood tests?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Take it before breakfast, got it. And just keep an eye out for anything weird, like you said. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything much better this time. I feel a lot better knowing we're starting with something simple. Elsie will be happy to hear we're not jumping straight to poking around inside me. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, or if you have any concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here are your prescription and lab requisition form. The lab is located just down the street. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Quicksey. I’ll go get those tests done and see how the medicine works. You've been very helpful. I hope to have some good news at the follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. You have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please take care. .
