DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right. My regular check-up showed my cholesterol is a little high, they said. Hyper... something. I don’t really remember all the words, but the doctor wanted me to come talk about it.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, Ms. Geho. That means elevated cholesterol. It’s quite common, thankfully, and often manageable. Now, to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit more about when you had this check-up, and what exactly the results were?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, hyperlipidemia. That makes more sense. It was… let me think… July 18th, I believe. The nurse gave me a paper, and I have it here somewhere… Ah, here we go. It says… total cholesterol is 240, LDL is 160, HDL is 45, and triglycerides are 150. Does that… mean anything to you? I mostly just saw the numbers were flagged as high.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Geho, those numbers do indeed provide more information. Your total cholesterol is elevated, and your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is also quite high. Your HDL, or “good” cholesterol, is a little on the lower side, and your triglycerides are borderline elevated. Now, do you have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. So, the higher numbers are the ones I should worry about? Yes, my father… he had some heart problems. He had a blockage, I think, and needed a… a stent, maybe? It was a long time ago. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, but I don’t know about cholesterol specifically. She didn't really talk about it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Geho, thank you. A family history of heart disease and, specifically, your father’s blockage, does increase your risk. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. What about… diet? I try to eat pretty healthy. Lots of vegetables, some fish… I do love my cheese though, I have to admit! And chocolate. Dark chocolate, of course. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Dark chocolate in moderation isn't necessarily detrimental, Ms. Geho. However, cheese can be high in saturated fat. And we will need to discuss your overall dietary fat intake. Now, do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: I do! Well, I try to. I walk most days, usually about 30-40 minutes. And I do a water aerobics class twice a week with some friends. It’s good fun, and gentle on the joints, you know, being my age. Is that enough? I don’t run marathons or anything!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Geho. Walking and water aerobics are both very beneficial. Thirty to forty minutes of walking most days is a good start, and the water aerobics is a plus. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but physical therapy fixed that right up. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I get my yearly checkups, and the doctor always says I’m doing alright. It’s just this cholesterol thing that’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just a baby aspirin every day, the doctor suggested it a while ago, just as a preventative thing. And sometimes I take vitamin D in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. That's it, I think. Nothing else. Oh! And occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take Tylenol. But that’s not regular, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Geho, given your cholesterol levels, family history, and lifestyle, we have a few options. We could attempt dietary modifications and increased exercise – though you are already quite active. However, given your LDL level of 160, I believe it would be prudent to consider medication. Statins are the standard treatment, and are generally very effective. Do you have any concerns about starting a statin?
PATIENT: Medication… Oh dear. I always try to avoid medication if I can, you know? Are there… side effects? I’ve heard things. And is it something I'd have to take forever? I mean, if I really change my diet and keep exercising, could I maybe get off it eventually? I'm just a little… hesitant, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitancy, Ms. Geho. All medications have potential side effects. With statins, the most common are muscle aches, but those are usually mild and manageable. More serious side effects are rare. As for taking it forever, that depends on your response to treatment and your ability to modify your lifestyle. We would monitor your cholesterol levels regularly. If you are able to significantly lower your LDL through diet and exercise, we might be able to reduce the dosage or even discontinue the medication at some point. However, given your family history, it is likely you would need to remain on some form of treatment long-term to manage your risk. We will start with a low dose, and see how you tolerate it. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… somewhat reassuring. Low dose is good. And regular monitoring is good too. I guess… what kind of low dose are we talking about? And what if I do get muscle aches? Would I just stop taking it? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: We would start with 10 milligrams of atorvastatin daily. It’s a very commonly prescribed statin. If you experience muscle aches, do not simply stop taking the medication. Contact me immediately. We can order blood tests to rule out other causes, and we may adjust the dosage or try a different statin. There are several available. It's important to understand that statins are generally very safe and effective, and the benefits of lowering your cholesterol significantly outweigh the risks. We will, of course, monitor your liver function as well. Does that clarify things?
PATIENT: Okay… 10 milligrams. And call you if I have muscle aches. Not stop taking it. I think I understand. Liver function too. It sounds like a lot to keep track of, but… if it helps my heart, I suppose I can try it. Yes, let’s try it. But please, be patient with me if I forget things.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Geho. I've written a prescription for atorvastatin 10 milligrams, and I'm providing you with some materials outlining the medication, potential side effects, and lifestyle modifications. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your cholesterol levels and discuss your response to treatment. I’ve also ordered a lipid panel and a comprehensive metabolic panel to establish a baseline. Do you have any questions about scheduling the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Three months, okay. And blood tests… good, good. No, I think I’m alright with the scheduling for now. The nurse usually handles that for me, doesn’t she? She’s very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, even if I ask a lot of questions. I think that’s all for today.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Geho. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. It's important to adhere to the lifestyle modifications outlined in the pamphlets, and to take the medication as prescribed. Have a good day. .
