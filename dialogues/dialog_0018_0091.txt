DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is nice to meet you as well. Well, lately I been drinkin' a lot of water. More than usual, you know? And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just… don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased thirst and increased appetite, even after eating… those are certainly things we should investigate. Could you tell me a little more about how much water you’re drinking in a typical day, compared to what you usually drink?
PATIENT: Hmm... usually, I have maybe two, three glasses of water a day. Just with meals and such. But now? Now I feel like I need to fill up a big pitcher, and I still feel thirsty! Maybe six, seven glasses? More, even. I not keepin' track exactly, but a lot more than before. It worryin' me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That is a significant increase. And you mentioned feeling hungry even after eating a good meal. Has this change in appetite been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It kinda slow, you know? Not like bam, one day I hungry all the time. It start with just feelin' a little peckish between meals. Then I start havin' bigger portions. Now, even after a good plate of food, I still feel like I could eat more. It been goin' on for maybe a month or so, I think. Hard to say exactly, time does fly!
DOCTOR: A month of gradually increasing thirst and appetite… alright. And have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, I been goin' to the bathroom more often, to pee. Maybe because I drinkin' so much water? I not sure. And… oh! I been feelin' a little tired lately too. Not sick tired, just… draggy, you know? Like I not gettin' enough rest, even when I sleep alright. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Increased urination and fatigue, along with the increased thirst and appetite… those are all things we need to explore further. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history... hmm. Well, I not been sick with nothin' serious, praise God. I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And my back trouble been botherin' me a little more lately, but that's just old age, I figure. I never been diagnosed with nothin' special, if that's what you mean. I does have a little trouble with my sugar sometimes, the doctor told me a few years ago, but I try to watch what I eat. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. You mentioned your sugar being a little high a few years ago. Do you recall what the doctor said specifically?
PATIENT: Not really. It was a long time ago, and I not good with rememberin' those kinds of things. She just said I needed to cut back on sweets and things. And I been tryin' to, mostly! I love a good mango, though, and those can be sweet... I don’t take no medicine for it, if that’s what you askin'. Just try to eat sensible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than a routine illness like the flu?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries, praise God. Never been in the hospital overnight for nothin’ serious, just when I had my babies, a long, long time ago. Everything was alright then, though. I just stay away from hospitals if I can, you know? They give me the willies.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Many people feel that way. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had the sugar, like me. She had to take pills for it, and she had trouble with her feet towards the end. My father, he had a bad heart, I think. He passed away when I was young, so I don't remember too much. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, but he take medicine for it and he alright now. That all I can really remember, Doctor. It been a long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's very helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, I don't do any of that! Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not anymore. It wasn't doin' me any good. And I definitely don't do any of those other things. I'm a church goin' woman, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just for my back trouble, sometimes. I take some ibuprofen when it’s really botherin' me, but not every day. And I take a little vitamin D, the doctor told me I was low on it last year. That's all, Doctor. Really, that's all. I try to stay natural as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Zicarelli. That gives me a very good understanding of your health history. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, increased appetite, frequent urination, and fatigue, along with your family history of diabetes – I would like to run some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. It's possible that you may be developing diabetes, but we need to confirm this with testing before making any conclusions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. I don't want nothin' serious, you know? I just want to feel like myself again. Whatever you need to do, I'm willin'. Just tell me what I have to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my assistant draw some blood from your arm. It will only take a few minutes. After the results come back, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to drink plenty of water, as you have been, but perhaps try to limit sugary drinks and snacks. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Go ahead and check me over. I just hope it's nothin' too bad. I got things to do, you know? Grandchildren to spoil!
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/90. That’s a little elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Your feet feel warm, and I'm noticing some slight swelling. Also, the sensation seems a little diminished in your toes. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That don't sound good, Doctor. Swellin'? I sometimes feel a little achy in my feet, especially at the end of the day, but I just figured it was from standin' too long. And… now that you mention it, yes, I do sometimes feel a little tingly in my toes. Not all the time, just sometimes. Like when I’m sittin’ for a long time. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. Zicarelli, but it's something we need to investigate further. Diminished sensation and swelling in the feet can sometimes be associated with diabetes, which is why it's important to get the blood tests done. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little slow. That’s another finding that can be associated with diabetes. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Your gait seems normal, but we’ll get a more complete picture with the blood work. Okay, Ms. Zicarelli, that completes the physical exam. Now, I’m going to have my assistant draw some blood. After the results come back, we’ll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Everything seemin' to point to that sugar thing, don't it? I was afraid of that. I guess I just want to know… how bad is it, if it is that sugar thing? And what would I have to do? Would I have to take pills for the rest of my life? And could I still eat a mango sometimes? I really love a good mango.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Ms. Zicarelli. It's understandable to be concerned. We won't know for sure until we get the blood test results, but based on your symptoms and the findings from the physical exam, it's certainly a possibility that you have diabetes. Now, if it is diabetes, the severity can vary. We would need to see your blood sugar levels to determine that. There are different types of diabetes, and the treatment depends on the type and severity. Regarding treatment, it often involves lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise. In some cases, medication is necessary, and that can be long-term. However, many people are able to manage their diabetes with diet and exercise alone. And yes, about the mangoes… It’s not necessarily about completely eliminating the things you enjoy, but about moderation and balance. If you have diabetes, you would need to be mindful of your carbohydrate intake, and that includes fruits like mangoes. But with careful planning, you should be able to enjoy a small portion of mangoes occasionally. We can work with a nutritionist to help you create a meal plan that suits your needs and preferences. The most important thing right now is to get the blood tests done so we can have a clear picture of what's going on. Then we can discuss all of your options and create a plan that's right for you. Does that help to ease your concerns a little?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, Doctor. Thank you. It good to know I might not have to give up my mangoes completely! So, where do we go from here? You said somethin' about a assistant? And them blood tests... how long will it take to get the results? I got church on Sunday, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad that eased your concerns a bit. Yes, my assistant, Sarah, will be in shortly to take you to the lab for the blood tests. It’s just a quick procedure – they'll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. We can call you with the results as soon as they are available, or if you prefer, you can call the office on Monday. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results and create a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Callin' me would be best, I don't like messin' with them phone machines. And Monday is fine. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowin' what to expect. I just hope it's not too bad. I still got a lot of livin' to do, you know? And a lot of grandchildren to spoil!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Zicarelli. And I assure you, we will do everything we can to help you stay healthy and enjoy all of the years to come. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s right for you. Sarah will be in shortly to assist you with the blood tests. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. You answered everything I was worryin' about. Thank you again for bein' so kind and patient with an old woman like me. I'll just sit here and wait for Sarah, then.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to let me know if anything comes to mind. I’ll check back with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
