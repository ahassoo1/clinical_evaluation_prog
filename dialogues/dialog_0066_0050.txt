DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… a cough. A dry cough. Been with me a while now, feels like. Hard to say how long, exactly. Things… blur these days, you know? It just… bothers me. Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It's completely normal for things to feel a little blurry as time goes on. A cough that's been bothering you for a while, especially at night… that's good information. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: More… how? It’s just… dry. Not much to tell. Doesn’t bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Just a tickle, then I cough. Happens more when I lay down, like I said. Used to be… my wife, she had something similar. She used to drink tea for it… but I don’t… I don’t remember what kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough, no mucus, worse when lying down… that helps. And you mentioned your wife had something similar – that's good to know. It’s alright if you don’t remember the specific tea. When did you first notice this cough starting?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. Maybe… last winter? Or the winter before? It feels like a long time ago now. Everything kinda blends together, you see. I wasn’t bothered enough to see anyone about it right away… just figured it would go away. But it hasn't.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It's common for things to get mixed up with time. So, roughly around last winter or the winter before, it started and hasn’t gone away. Besides the cough and trouble sleeping, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. I get… tired easily, I suppose. More than usual. But I’m an old man, so… hard to say if that's anything new. And… sometimes, my chest feels… tight. Not painful, exactly, just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a feeling of tightness in your chest… those are important things to note. Not painful, just heavy, you said. Do you have any shortness of breath, even with light activity, or does that chest tightness make it hard to breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I don’t do much to get breathless, you see. Mostly just sit and watch the television. Maybe a little walking around the house. But no, I don’t puff and pant or anything. The tightness… it’s just there. Kind of a constant… pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, no shortness of breath, just a constant pressure in your chest. That's helpful. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t been feeling hot, if that’s what you mean. Chills… maybe a little when the weather gets cold, but that’s just an old man’s bones, you know? Night sweats… I can't rightly say. I don’t pay much attention to the sheets these days. My wife used to do the laundry...
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. No fever, chills only related to the cold weather, and you haven’t noticed any night sweats. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you know if you've ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like heart problems, lung problems, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tough one. My wife always took care of those papers. I… I remember being sick as a child, like everyone. But… big illnesses? Not that I recall. The doctors… they didn’t tell me much of anything back then. Just told my wife what to do. I think… I think she said something about my blood pressure being a little high, once. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible history of high blood pressure, but mostly managed by your wife. It's alright if you don't remember specific details. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was young. That I remember. And… after the war, I was in the hospital for a little bit. Shrapnel, you see. But… nothing serious, not like some of the others. Just cleaned it up and sent me home. No surgeries… besides the appendix, that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and some treatment for shrapnel wounds after the war. No other surgeries that you remember. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, lung disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my brothers and sisters… most of them are gone now. My oldest brother… he had a bad heart. Died young. And my sister… she had something with her lungs. Always coughing. But… beyond that, I don't rightly remember. They didn't talk about sickness much. Just got on with things, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your brother and lung problems in your sister. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always said I could eat anything. She used to tease me about my iron stomach. No hives, no swelling… nothing. Just an old man who likes his food, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Haven’t taken anything… regular, anyway. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Always made me feel… strange. My wife used to keep track of everything…
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright Brodie, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just get a general sense of how you're doing. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. Just… be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Brodie. I will be very gentle. Okay, Brodie, your blood pressure is a little elevated. Your heart sounds a bit quiet, and your lungs have some decreased air movement with some wheezing. Your chest is a little tender when I touch it. I don’t hear anything abnormal when I tap on your chest.
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? Like… a whistling sound? My wife… she used to say I rattled sometimes. Just a little bit. Is it… bad? The tenderness… that could be from the war, maybe? Old wounds acting up?
DOCTOR: Yes, wheezing is like a whistling sound when you breathe. It sounds like your airways are a little narrowed. And yes, the tenderness could definitely be from old wounds, or it could be related to your lungs as well. It's hard to say for certain without a little more information. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you might have some underlying lung issues, possibly something like chronic bronchitis or even mild asthma. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to keep an eye on. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood tests. The X-ray will let us see if there's anything going on in your lungs, and the blood tests will help us check your overall health and rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood tests… More poking and prodding, eh? Well… if you think it's best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try to make it quick, alright? I don't like needles. And I… I don't have insurance, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It's alright, we'll take it as easy as possible. And yes, I know you don’t have insurance, and we can definitely discuss options to make things as affordable as possible. I'll work with the clinic’s financial department to see what we can do. The X-ray is quick, just a brief exposure to some radiation. The blood test will be a few small vials of blood, and the phlebotomist is very good, so it shouldn't hurt too much. First, let's get you scheduled for the X-ray. It can be done right here at the clinic. Then, we'll draw the blood. After we get the results, we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. X-ray first, then the blood. And you’ll help me with the cost? That would be a blessing. I… I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: You're not a burden at all, Brodie. We'll definitely work with you on the cost. I'll have the receptionist schedule the X-ray and then we can talk about the financial assistance options. I'll also have her print out a paper for you to take with your X-ray and blood test results. Now, while we wait for the tests, I’m going to give you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. It’s a quick-relief medicine that will help open up your airways if you feel short of breath or wheezy. It can really help you feel better in the meantime. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: An inhaler… to help me breathe? Yes, that sounds… good. Very good. I’ve been feeling… tighter lately. Especially at night. An inhaler… maybe that will help me sleep. Is it… difficult to use? I'm not very good with… gadgets.
DOCTOR: It's not difficult at all, Brodie. It's a simple device. You shake it, take a deep breath, and press the canister to release the medicine while you inhale. It's just a puff of air with medicine in it. We’ll also have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave, and you can practice with her. It might take a few tries to get comfortable, but it’s easy once you get the hang of it. Do you have any questions about the inhaler or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Shake it, breathe deep, press the button. Like… a little puff of air. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It's… reassuring. And for helping with the cost. Things have been… difficult, lately.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. I'm glad I could help. It’s my job to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable with your care. Alright, let's go ahead and get you scheduled for that X-ray and blood draw, and then we’ll get the nurse to come in and show you how to use the inhaler. After that, we’ll get you set up with a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. Thank you. I… I think that’s everything for now. Let’s get this over with, then. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I'll have the receptionist come in and get you scheduled. She'll also let the nurse know to come by after that to show you how to use the inhaler. Just take a seat here, and someone will be with you shortly. Thank you, Brodie, and please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions at all.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: The receptionist is getting you scheduled now, Brodie. The nurse will be here in just a few minutes to show you how to use the inhaler. Is there anything else I can get for you while you wait?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I'm alright. Just… a little nervous, I suppose. It's been a long time since I've been to the doctor. But I’m sure I’ll be fine. Thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be nervous, Brodie. It's been a while, and it’s alright to feel a little anxious. Just remember, we're here to help you feel better. I'll be right here if you need anything at all, and the nurse is very gentle and will explain everything carefully. We’ll get through this together, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. That… that means a lot. I… I appreciate it. I really do.
DOCTOR: "Hi Brodie, I'm Nurse Anya. Dr. Condray asked me to come by and show you how to use your new inhaler. Are you ready to learn?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Nurse Anya. Yes, I think so. The Doctor was just explaining it to me. It looks… a little complicated, but I’m willing to try.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: "Not complicated at all, Brodie! It just takes a little practice. Here, let's start with holding it correctly. You want to put your thumb on the bottom, and your fingers on the sides. We'll shake it a few times to make sure the medicine is mixed up, then we’ll practice taking a deep breath.” “Now, you try. Take a nice deep breath… and press down on the canister while you breathe in. Don’t worry if it doesn't feel perfect the first time. We’ll keep practicing until you feel comfortable.”
PATIENT: Oh dear… that didn’t feel right. I think I pressed it too hard. It’s… harder than it looks.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: "That's perfectly alright, Brodie! It is a little tricky at first. A lot of people have trouble with it. Don't worry, we'll get it. It sounds like you were holding your breath instead of breathing while you pressed the canister. Also, it's good to exhale completely before taking your breath. Here, let's try it again. Exhale all the way out... and as you start to breathe in, press down on the canister at the same time. Try to breathe in slowly and deeply. I'll stay right here with you.”
PATIENT: Is… is that better? It still feels strange, but maybe… maybe a little better. I’m just worried I’m not getting enough air. It feels like I’m fighting it, instead of working with it.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: "Yes, that is much better, Brodie! You’re getting the hang of it! You’re right, it can feel a little strange at first, like you’re fighting it. That's because you’re learning a new skill. It takes practice! Try to relax your shoulders and breathe slowly and deeply. It’s less about forcing the air and more about letting it flow naturally. Now, you try it again. And remember, we can practice as many times as you need. Don’t worry about getting it perfect right away. Just focus on relaxing and breathing slowly and deeply.
PATIENT: That… that felt right! It still feels strange, but… not as hard. Maybe I’m finally getting it. Thank you, Nurse Anya. You’re very patient.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: "You did it, Brodie! That was excellent! You're a natural! See?
PATIENT: A natural, eh? I haven’t felt very natural lately. Well, thank you again, Nurse Anya. I feel a little better just knowing how to use it.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: "You're very welcome, Brodie! And don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions later. Dr. Condray will be in to discuss the X-ray and blood test results soon. In the meantime, try to relax and remember what we practiced. You've got this!"
