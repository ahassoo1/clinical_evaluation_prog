DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schneer. Welcome. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Pirl, is it? Yes, well… it’s my ears. They just aren’t what they used to be, you know? Things are… muffled. It’s hard to hear folks sometimes. Not sure when it started, really. Just happened gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. Alright. And is this affecting one ear more than the other, or is it both ears equally?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… … I think… both, maybe? It's hard to say for sure. I don’t really pay attention to which one specifically. Everything just sounds… distant. Like I’m underwater, sometimes. Do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Distant” and “muffled” are common descriptions. Now, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, perhaps?
PATIENT: Ringing… … Now that you mention it… sometimes. Very faint, though. It comes and goes. Not all the time. More when it’s quiet, I think. Like… a high-pitched whine. But it's not constant, and I usually don't notice it unless I’m really trying to listen for it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A faint, intermittent ringing – we call that tinnitus. Now, have you experienced any pain in or around your ears, or any dizziness or balance problems lately?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain at all. Not a bit. And dizziness… well, I get a little unsteady sometimes, but I just figured that was my age. I’m 83, you know! Things get a little wobbly. I wouldn’t say it's dizziness exactly, more like… a little off balance when I stand up too fast. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Schneer. A little unsteadiness with standing is quite common at your age, but it’s important to note. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… … I had a little sniffle back in the spring, I think. Just a common cold, nothing serious. Didn’t last long. And… I had a touch of the flu a couple of years ago, but I’ve been pretty healthy otherwise. Mostly just aches and pains, you know? Old age creeping up on me. I don’t remember being terribly sick recently, though. Nothing that would affect my ears, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… … Let me think. Just the usual stuff for my blood pressure, I suppose. A little pill every morning. And… Oh! And something for my arthritis, a white one. Can't remember the name, truthfully. As for allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Not that I recall, anyway. It's hard to keep track, you know? Things slip your mind as you get older.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Schneer. It is difficult to remember everything. Do you know the dosages of your blood pressure and arthritis medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dosages… … No, no I don’t. I just take what the doctor tells me to. My daughter usually handles refilling them. I’d have to ask her. She knows all that stuff. I'm terrible with numbers. I just know to take a little blue one and a little white one every morning with my breakfast. That's about all I can tell you. Would she mind if I called her now? She's just down the street.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We can certainly contact your daughter. Before we do, though, let’s do a quick examination of your ears. It will only take a moment. Perhaps we can get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. An examination sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. My ears have been through worse, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m just going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument, and shine a light to get a better view. This may feel a little cool. I'll examine both ears. Alright, the left ear canal appears a little narrow, some cerumen buildup. The tympanic membrane is a bit dull, but I don't see any obvious signs of infection or perforation. And the right ear is similar – some cerumen, slightly dull tympanic membrane. No obvious signs of acute issues here either. It appears you have some wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the muffled hearing. I also note some age-related changes to the ear canal.
PATIENT: Wax, you say? That makes sense, I suppose. I haven't really paid much attention to cleaning them. Always thought you were supposed to leave that to the professionals. So, the wax is the problem then? Is it something you can just… remove? Is that what you're going to do? I'd be happy to get rid of some wax if that's what's causing all the trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s very likely the wax buildup is contributing to the muffled hearing, yes. We can certainly address that. I can remove it with a simple ear irrigation procedure, or use a wax softening agent over a few days. Irrigation is quicker, but some people find it a little uncomfortable. Would you prefer to try the softening drops first, or would you like to proceed with the irrigation?
PATIENT: Hmm… … Irrigation sounds a bit… scary. I'm not fond of things going in my ears, if you know what I mean. I think I'd prefer the drops. A bit slower is fine with me. I don't mind waiting a few days if it means avoiding anything… forceful. Yes, the drops sound much nicer. Are they easy to use? I don't want to make a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Excellent choice, Mr. Schneer. The drops are very easy to use. I will provide you with a bottle of cerumenolytic solution – that's the fancy name for ear wax softening drops. You’ll simply lie on your side with the affected ear facing upwards, put a few drops into the ear canal, and remain in that position for five to ten minutes. Repeat this twice daily for three to five days. Afterward, the wax should soften and fall out on its own. I'll give you a tissue to wipe away any excess. I'll also write you a prescription for a small bottle. If the wax doesn’t fall out on its own after five days, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to perform a manual removal. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Drops for a few days, then see you again if it doesn’t work. Yes, that’s a good plan. And if it does work, will my hearing just… come back? Will I be able to hear everyone clearly again? My daughter gets so frustrated with me sometimes, she says I never hear a word she says. I just want to be able to hear things properly again.
DOCTOR: It’s very likely your hearing will improve significantly once the wax is removed, Mr. Schneer. It may not be a complete restoration, as there could be some age-related hearing loss contributing, but it should make a noticeable difference. I’m hopeful your daughter will be pleased! Here is the prescription for the ear drops. Just follow the instructions carefully. If you experience any pain, discomfort, or dizziness while using the drops, stop immediately and contact the office. We’ve discussed the ear wax buildup and a plan for removal. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not laughing at me for not knowing what a “cerumenolytic solution” is! I appreciate your patience. I think I’ll just go home and try these drops, and hopefully, I'll be able to hear my daughter a little better soon. Yes, thank you again. It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And do let me know how the drops work for you. Have a lovely day, and I hope to see you soon.
