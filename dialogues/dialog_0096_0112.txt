DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Keoni MacVittie. It's… nice to meet you, Doctor. Though, truthfully, I don’t recall making an appointment. Not that I don’t need to be here, just… a bit vague on how I arrived at this point.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, the system says you’re scheduled. Doesn't matter much right now. Look, I'm Dr. Burlingham. We'll figure it out. More importantly, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well… that’s what I’m here to discuss, isn’t it? It’s… my bladder, I think. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot. More than usual, certainly. It’s… disruptive, and a little concerning. I don’t really… know how to explain it beyond that, honestly. It just feels like I constantly need to go.
DOCTOR: “A lot” is… not very helpful, dear. Everyone goes to the bathroom. Can you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re right, I apologize. That wasn’t very specific, was it? Let me think… normally, I’d say… every three or four hours, perhaps? Now, it feels like… every hour, sometimes less. And even then, it’s not always a full bladder, if that makes sense. It's more of an… urge. A frequent, nagging urge. I haven't been keeping strict track, I'm afraid. It's been… gradual.
DOCTOR: Gradual, you say. And how long has this “gradual” process been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… difficult to say precisely. Weeks, I think? Perhaps a month or so? It’s hard to pinpoint, truly. Things have been… rather unsettled lately, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. I noticed it getting worse recently, though. That's why I… well, that’s why I’m here, I presume. I just… kept hoping it would resolve on its own. It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A month. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, not exactly pain. It’s not burning, no. More of a… discomfort, sometimes. A slight ache low in my abdomen, but it’s not constant, and it’s not severe. It's very mild, and easily dismissed. The frequency is the biggest issue, truly. It’s… quite unsettling to be constantly worried about finding a restroom.
DOCTOR: Any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, none of those. No fever, chills, nausea… no, everything else feels… normal, actually. It’s just this bladder issue. I haven’t felt unwell otherwise. No changes in my appetite, no weight loss, nothing like that. I’ve been… a little tired, perhaps, but I attribute that to… well, life, generally. It hasn't been a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes, I am. Though… it’s not a frequent occurrence, I assure you. I am divorced, you see, and… well, it's not a priority at the moment. But yes, I am. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I apologize if that’s a personal question.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant. It can be. Now, any changes in your vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. I… I haven’t really noticed anything different, no. I… I don’t regularly examine myself, if that makes sense. I suppose I should be more diligent, but… it’s not something I’ve prioritized. Everything feels normal, if that’s any reassurance. I apologize for my lack of… specific information, Doctor. It’s just… not a topic I readily discuss.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s move on. Any family history of bladder problems, kidney issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother… I believe she had some issues with her blood sugar later in life, but I don’t recall it being formally diagnosed as diabetes. She had some… circulatory problems, and swelling in her legs. And my grandmother… she had frequent UTIs, I think. She was always getting them. As for kidney problems… not that I’m aware of, no. It’s difficult to say with certainty, though. My family isn’t very forthcoming about medical history. I'm afraid I don't have much detailed information.
DOCTOR: And what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social… habits? Oh. You mean… do I drink alcohol? Or smoke? No, I don’t. Never have. I enjoy a cup of tea in the evenings, but that’s… hardly a habit, is it? I don't go out much, truthfully. Mostly just… quiet evenings at home. I do enjoy gardening, if that counts. I try to stay active, though it's difficult sometimes. Is there something specific you're looking for, Doctor? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.
DOCTOR: No, you're not misunderstanding. I need to know about your fluid intake. How much water do you drink a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. That’s… a good question. I don’t really… keep track. Perhaps… four or five glasses? It varies, truly. More in the summer, naturally. I do enjoy a cup of tea with my breakfast, and sometimes another in the afternoon. I suppose I should be drinking more water, I’ve always been told. But I often forget. My memory isn’t what it used to be, as I’ve mentioned. Is that sufficient information, Doctor? I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, just let me know if anything… feels uncomfortable. I'm a little nervous, truthfully, but I understand it's important. Shall I… lie down? Or… where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: If you'd like, lie down on the table. We'll start with your abdomen. I'll just be listening and feeling for anything unusual. Please let me know if anything is tender.
PATIENT: Alright. I'm ready, Doctor. Please, take your time. And… yes, I will let you know if anything feels… tender. Though, I must confess, I'm rather sensitive, so please be gentle. It's… a little embarrassing, being examined like this, but I understand it’s necessary. I’ll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is soft, no masses that I can feel. There is some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, but nothing overly concerning. Bowel sounds are normal. Your lower back feels normal as well. No tenderness there. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick pelvic exam. I know this can be uncomfortable, so please let me know if you need me to stop at any point. I’ll use a speculum to get a better look. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. A pelvic exam… I understand. Please… be as gentle as possible. And… yes, please stop if it becomes too uncomfortable. I… I’ve not had one in quite some time. I confess, I'm a little anxious about it. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Just… please let me know what you’re doing as you go along. That would be… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to warm the speculum now. This will make it a little easier to insert. I’ll explain everything before I do it. I’m just applying a little lubricant. Now, I’m going to gently insert the speculum. Just relax your muscles as much as possible. It will feel a bit of pressure, but shouldn't be painful. Take a deep breath. Okay. Your vaginal walls appear normal. No signs of infection or inflammation. Your cervix looks… slightly congested, but nothing overly concerning at this point. I'm going to take a swab to test for a UTI. This might feel a little uncomfortable for a moment. Alright, that's all done. Just going to check your external genitalia. Everything looks normal externally as well. Alright. That completes the physical exam. Now we’ll send the urine sample to the lab. It'll take a few days to get the results back.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. That… wasn’t as bad as I anticipated, thankfully. Although, I must admit, it was rather unsettling. A few days for the results, you say? Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. While we’re waiting, is there anything… anything at all… that you suspect might be causing this? Any suggestions for what I should be doing in the meantime? Or… any red flags I should be watching out for? I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It's… reassuring to know you're taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: Well, frequent urination can be caused by a number of things. It could be a simple UTI, which we'll know for sure once the lab results come back. It could also be an overactive bladder, or even just drinking too many fluids before bed. Less common, but we have to rule it out, is diabetes. In the meantime, I want you to try to keep a fluid diary. Write down everything you drink, and how much. And try to avoid caffeine and alcohol. Also, try to urinate on a schedule, even if you don't feel the urge. Every two to three hours during the day. And make sure you're emptying your bladder completely each time. And if you develop a fever, chills, or any pain in your back or side, go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t wait for the results. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… clear. A fluid diary, avoid caffeine and alcohol, scheduled urination… and watch out for fever, chills, and pain. It sounds… rather involved. But I will do my best. I suppose I should have been more mindful of my habits previously. It’s just… everything has been rather chaotic lately, and I haven’t been as diligent about my health as I should be. And… if the urine test comes back negative, what then? What are the next steps, Doctor? I apologize for being so… inquisitive, but I find it… comforting to know what to expect. I don't like being left in the dark, if you understand.
DOCTOR: If the urine test is negative, we'll need to investigate further. That could involve a referral to a urologist for more specialized testing. They may want to do a bladder scan to check for residual urine, or even a cystoscopy to look inside your bladder. Don't worry about that now. Let's just get the urine test back first. I'm not going to jump to conclusions. And honestly, most of the time, it's a simple UTI. Try not to stress yourself out. Here. This is a prescription for a macrobid, just in case it is a UTI. Start taking it if you develop any symptoms like burning or frequent urination. If your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, call the office and we’ll figure things out. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Macrobid… alright. If symptoms worsen, call the office. Yes, I understand. And… is there anything I can do to… alleviate the discomfort in the meantime? Anything over-the-counter that might help? Or… any lifestyle changes beyond the fluid diary and scheduled urination? I just… I find it rather difficult to focus when I’m constantly worried about needing to find a restroom. I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I just want to feel… prepared. And perhaps a little less anxious.
DOCTOR: Honestly, there’s not much you can do besides what I’ve already told you. Staying hydrated is important, but don't overdo it. And avoiding caffeine and alcohol will help. As for the discomfort… over-the-counter cranberry juice might help, but the evidence is limited. It’s mostly a myth. Honestly, the best thing you can do is just… relax. Stress makes everything worse. Try to take deep breaths and focus on something else. And try not to obsess over it. Alright. I think that covers everything. Call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And try not to worry. Most of the time, it’s nothing serious. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor. For your time… and your patience. I will… try to relax. And I will call the office if anything changes. Thank you again. Goodbye, Doctor. .
