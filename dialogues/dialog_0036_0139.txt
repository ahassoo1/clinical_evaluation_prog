DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… need check-up for… referee stuff. For work. Want to make sure I’m okay to keep doing it. Quick, if possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for your work as a referee. I understand wanting to keep things quick. To start, can you tell me a little more about what the requirements are for the check-up?
PATIENT: Requirements… uh… they just said “fitness evaluation”. I think… running, maybe? And… strength? Not sure exactly. I mostly just fix things, not… do tests. They want to see if I can still keep up, you know? I'm 31. Not old, but… want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right, a general fitness evaluation. That’s perfectly reasonable. And you’re right, 31 isn’t old at all! We can definitely assess your fitness level. To get a better idea of what we should focus on, can you describe a typical day or a typical shift as a referee?
PATIENT: Typical… long. I fix the brick inside the furnaces. Hot work. Lots of lifting… heavy stuff. Sometimes climbing. Then I go to games… basketball mostly. Run a bit, blow whistle. Not as much lifting there, thank goodness. It’s… a lot of back and forth. All day. Sometimes overtime. It's tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, so physically demanding work with the furnace repair, involving heavy lifting, climbing, and prolonged standing, and then running and officiating basketball games. That gives me a good picture. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Had the flu a couple times. Nothing serious. Broke my wrist when I was a kid, but healed good. My wife… she… she was sick. A long time ago. But… that was… different. I don't think it's important now. No problems with my back or anything. I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history other than the flu and a childhood wrist fracture. That’s good to know. And I understand you'd prefer not to discuss your wife’s illness; we don’t have to. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… water. Sometimes coffee. That's it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel… weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. I eat everything. Well… not bugs. But everything else. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife… she had some allergies… but I don’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… my father… he had high blood pressure. He ate a lot of salt. And my mother… she had… something with her bones. Old age, I think. But… that was in China. Far away. Not really sure. I don’t think anything I need to worry about. They didn’t have good doctors there, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure in your father and some bone issues in your mother. We'll keep those in mind. Now, before we move to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I work. A lot. I sleep when I can. I eat… okay food. Not fancy. I don’t drink much. Don’t smoke. Mostly just… trying to get through the day. I try to walk sometimes, when I have time. Not much else. It’s… simple. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. It sounds like you have a very busy and straightforward lifestyle. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your back and joints to assess your range of motion and look for any signs of pain or injury. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Just… make it quick, please? I have to… get back to work. Not a lot of time. But… go ahead. I'll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the table, if you're comfortable. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch. Little stiff. Haven’t been doing much stretching lately. Been busy. Still… I can do it. Just… feels a bit tight. Don’t worry about it. Old work injury, maybe. It’s okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. And when you bend backwards?
PATIENT: Better that way. Still… not as flexible as I used to be. Years of… you know. Lifting. It’s just… normal. Don’t make a big deal about it. I can still move. That’s what matters. Just… a little tight.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m not detecting any significant tenderness along your spine. Your range of motion is slightly limited, as you mentioned, with some discomfort. Now, let’s quickly check your joints. Can you rotate your shoulders for me?
PATIENT: Shoulders are fine. No problem there. Used to lifting heavy things. They get a workout. Been doing that for a long time. Not hurting or anything. Everything okay? Can I… go now? I really need to get back.
DOCTOR: Knees and ankles seem stable, with full range of motion and no pain on movement. Okay, everything appears to be structurally sound, although you do have some stiffness and limited range of motion in your back, likely from your work. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it doesn’t seem like you have any conditions that would prevent you from continuing your work as a referee. However, I do recommend that you focus on stretching and strengthening exercises to improve your flexibility and prevent future injuries. It might also be helpful to see a physical therapist for a more comprehensive evaluation and individualized exercise plan. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I… think that’s okay. Stretching. Right. I’ll try. But… really busy. Physical therapist… expensive, right? I’ll… see what I can do. Just glad I don’t have anything… bad. Thank you, Doctor. Can I… go now? Really need to get back.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll write a brief note summarizing our findings and recommending stretching exercises. We can also provide you with some resources for local physical therapy if you decide to pursue that option. Here's a quick note for your work: Yamir Shanor is cleared for continued work as a referee. Recommend incorporating regular stretching exercises into his routine. Here’s a printed copy of this note. Thank you for coming in today, Yamir. Please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment if you have any concerns in the future. Have a safe day, and take care of yourself.
