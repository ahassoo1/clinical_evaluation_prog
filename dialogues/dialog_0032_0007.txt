DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. My back is very painful. It’s been hurting for some time now. I would like to get it sorted, if possible. I don’t have much time today, so if we could be brief, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. We will do our best to be concise. “Some time now” is rather vague, however. Could you tell me approximately when the pain began?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me think. It started, I believe, sometime in late March. Perhaps the beginning of April. It was a gradual thing, not a sudden injury. Just… started aching after a long day of work. I erect fences, you see. It's hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Erecting fences…that certainly explains a potential source of discomfort. And it’s been consistently present since April?
PATIENT: Not consistently. Some days are worse than others. It depends on the weather, how much lifting I have to do… if the ground is hard. Lately, it’s been nearly every day. Even just sitting is uncomfortable now. It radiates down my left side a little, too. Not sharp, but… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Radiating pain is significant. And you say it’s primarily on the left side?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly my left side. It goes from my back, around my hip… down my leg a bit. Not below the knee, thankfully. But it makes walking difficult sometimes. And sleeping. I have to find a very specific position, and even then it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a clearer picture, Ms. Reihner, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Describe it… Well, it's not a stabbing pain, like a knife. It's more of a… heavy ache. A constant pressure, really. Like someone is sitting on my back. And when I move, especially bending over, it gets sharper, but still… dull. It’s hard to explain. It just is painful. A wearing kind of pain, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Wearing” is a useful descriptor, actually. Now, have you noticed anything that specifically relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Relieves it…? Not really. Sitting still helps a little, but I can't sit completely still all day. And lying down flat sometimes eases it, but like I said, finding the right position is… difficult. Hot baths offer a temporary reprieve, but the relief doesn't last. Honestly, nothing really gets rid of it. It’s just… managed. Barely.
DOCTOR: Have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have tried ibuprofen. And… acetaminophen, I believe it is called. They take the edge off, perhaps. But they don't solve the problem. And I don’t like taking too many pills. It’s not good for you, is it?
DOCTOR: No, indiscriminate use of analgesics is rarely optimal. Now, Ms. Reihner, before we proceed to a physical examination, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? No, not that I know of. No one has ever told me I had arthritis. My mother had some trouble with her joints when she was older, but I don’t recall her ever being formally diagnosed with anything. I’ve never had any major surgeries or broken any bones, either. Mostly just aches and pains from hard work. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Ms. Reihner. And to be thorough, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Well… I have Medicare, if that tells you anything. They sent me a lot of questionnaires. I have… high blood pressure, I think it’s called. The doctor told me to watch my salt intake. And I had a bout of the flu a couple of years back, but I recovered fully. Apart from that… not much. I try to stay healthy. It’s hard when you work outdoors, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, and never had a reaction. And I haven’t taken many medications, thankfully. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, as I mentioned. I am not sensitive to anything that I am aware of. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good to know. Very well. Now, Ms. Reihner, I would like to perform a brief physical examination of your back and legs to assess the source of your discomfort. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's… acceptable. I suppose we have to, if you’re going to help me. Just please be quick about it, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please lie face down on the table for me, if you’re able. I will begin with palpation of your spine to assess for tenderness or muscle spasm. We will proceed as efficiently as possible.
PATIENT: Alright. Be gentle, please. My back is very sensitive. I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ow. Yes. There. That’s… tender. It’s not a sharp pain, but… it’s definitely uncomfortable. A dull ache, like before. Please be careful. It feels like you’re pressing right on the sore spot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: Yes, there too. They’re very tight. And… sore. It feels like knots. Like they need to be… loosened. It's hard to explain. They’ve been like that for some time, I think. From lifting, mostly. A lot of lifting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you try to touch your toes for me, if you are able?
PATIENT: Ow. No. Not really. It hurts too much. I can get… this far. But I can't go any further without a lot of pain. It pulls on my back. And it feels… tight. Like something is blocking me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This won't hurt, but please relax your legs.
PATIENT: They feel… okay. I don’t know what I’m looking for, to be honest. But they jumped, I think. When you hit them. Is that good? Bad? I just want to know if something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. They appear normal, and that's reassuring. Now, I’m going to check the sensation in your legs. Please tell me if you feel any tingling or numbness.
PATIENT: Yes. I feel that. Both legs feel… the same. No tingling, no numbness. Just… normal feeling. Like always. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel, Doctor. I just know if I can feel it or not. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Reihner. Alright. Based on my examination, and your description of your symptoms, it appears you are experiencing a musculoskeletal strain, likely aggravated by your occupation. There is no indication of nerve compression at this time, which is reassuring. However, given the persistence of your symptoms, I would like to order some imaging to rule out any underlying structural issues. I recommend an X-ray of your lumbar spine.
PATIENT: An X-ray? Will that… show something? I just want to be able to work, Doctor. Is it serious? What if it is something serious? I don’t want to be laid up for weeks. I have bills to pay. I just want it fixed, if possible. And I don't want a lot of complicated procedures. Can we just… try something else first?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. An X-ray will allow us to visualize the bones in your spine and rule out any fractures or other significant structural abnormalities. It's a precautionary measure. While it's unlikely to be a serious issue, it's important to have a complete picture before proceeding with treatment. Before we discuss more invasive options, we can attempt a conservative approach. I recommend physical therapy twice a week for four weeks, combined with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication as needed. We can also discuss muscle relaxants to help alleviate some of the pain and spasm, although these can cause drowsiness. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… and pills? I suppose. As long as the pills don’t make me too sleepy. I need to be able to function. Four weeks seems… a long time. Will that really help? And what if it doesn’t help? What then? I just want to get back to work as soon as possible. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe a shot? Something quicker? I really don’t have a lot of time for this.
DOCTOR: A cortisone injection is an option, Ms. Reihner. However, it's a temporary solution and doesn't address the underlying cause of the strain. It can provide short-term pain relief, but repeated injections can have negative side effects. I generally reserve these for more severe cases or when other treatments have failed. Given your concerns, we can start with physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. If you don't see improvement after two weeks, we can reassess and discuss a cortisone injection. However, I strongly advise against relying solely on injections, as they do not prevent recurrence. I will write a prescription for ibuprofen and a referral to physical therapy. The physical therapist will be able to assess your specific needs and develop a tailored treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referral?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… ibuprofen, and physical therapy. And try to get back to work. Is the physical therapy far? I don’t drive much anymore. And will Medicare cover it? I don't want to be surprised with a big bill. That would be… unpleasant. Can you make sure they know about Medicare? I need to know that it’s covered before I go. Is there a number I can call if I have problems? I just want to make sure everything is taken care of. I don't want to have to worry about more things on top of my back pain.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. The physical therapy center is located at 123 Main Street, approximately two miles from here. They do accept Medicare, and I will include a note on the referral specifically requesting they verify your coverage before your first appointment. Here is your referral and prescription. The phone number for the physical therapy center is 555-1212. You can call them directly to schedule an appointment and confirm your coverage. I will also include my office number on the referral in case you have any questions or concerns. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after two weeks of physical therapy, please contact my office, and we can discuss further options, including imaging and potential referral to a specialist. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time, and I hope this… works. I suppose I’ll… see what happens. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Reihner. I wish you a speedy recovery. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
