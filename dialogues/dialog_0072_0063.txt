DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you have an appointment with me today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, it’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual. I have… the cancer, you know? And the back pain is… a lot. It makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your record that you have a history of cancer. And you're experiencing increased back pain. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not like a sharp pain, all the time. More like… a heavy ache. And it goes down my legs sometimes. Both of them. It's worse when I try to stand up, or if I bend over. Even sitting for too long is bad. It just… gets worse with moving, pretty much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And when did you first notice this increased pain?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? Slowly, you know? I thought it was just a bad day at first. But it hasn't gotten better. It's been getting worse every week, I think. About a month, yes. Maybe a little longer. I’m not good with dates.
DOCTOR: A month. Alright. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Not really, I don’t think so. Just… doing things. Like, I was trying to help my niece with some boxes last week. Not heavy ones! But even that made it worse. And then just… walking around the house. Nothing special happened, you know? It just… hurts more now. I haven't fallen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: I see. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh… zero to ten. Let me think. Right now? It's… maybe a seven? Sometimes it goes higher, like an eight. But right now, sitting here, it's a seven. It’s always something, you know? Even when I’m trying to rest. It just doesn’t go away completely.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the back pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I’ve been… tired a lot. More tired than usual, even for me. And… sometimes my legs feel… numb? Not all the time. Just… tingly. And… …it’s hard to… go to the bathroom sometimes. You know… having trouble. Sorry. It's embarrassing. But it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's important to tell me everything, Ms. Meigs. Nothing is embarrassing when it comes to your health. You mentioned fatigue, tingling in your legs, and difficulty with… bowel and bladder function. Is the difficulty with urination or defecation, or both?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. It’s… harder to go. And… I have to go more often. Especially at night. It wakes me up sometimes. It’s… not good. It started around the same time as the back pain getting worse, I think. It’s all connected, you know? Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: I understand. And are you currently taking any medications for your cancer or for pain?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take… let me see. I take oxycodone for the pain. Two pills, three times a day. And I have… letrozole, for the cancer itself. One pill every day. And… sometimes, I take something for the nausea, but not every day. It depends. I think that one is called… ondansetron. When the nausea is bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. My mom always said I was a strong baby. No allergies, no. I’m lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination now. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. I'll also need to palpate your spine to assess for tenderness or abnormalities. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I want to know what’s happening. Please. Check everything. My back… it worries me. Yes, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's check your strength. Please try to resist as I push against your legs. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups, also normal. Now, sensation. Tell me when you feel this. Sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally. Palpating your spine now… There is tenderness upon palpation at the lumbar level. No step-off deformity noted. Alright. That's all for the physical examination.
PATIENT: Okay… tenderness, you said? At the lumbar level? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Is it the cancer? Is it… spreading? I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Tenderness, Ms. Meigs, indicates inflammation or irritation in that area. It does not automatically mean the cancer is spreading. However, given your history, we need to investigate further to determine the cause. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine and potentially a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to assess for any abnormalities. I will also order blood work, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, to evaluate your overall health. We need to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as nerve compression or spinal cord involvement. I'm also going to consult with oncology to discuss your case and determine the best course of action. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I mean, scary, but good. I want to know what's happening. MRI, CT scan, blood work… whatever you think is best. And talking to the cancer doctors… yes, please. I need to know. Yes, all of it. Please, help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I've placed the orders for the MRI, CT scan, and blood work. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the imaging. I've also sent a message to oncology requesting a consultation. In the meantime, I'm going to slightly increase your oxycodone dosage. I'll write you a new prescription for two pills every four hours as needed for pain. However, please do not exceed the maximum daily dosage. We want to manage your pain effectively, but we also need to be mindful of potential side effects. It's important to note that these tests will take time to complete, and the results may not be immediately available. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a comprehensive treatment plan once all the results are in. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Two pills every four hours… okay. I can remember that. More often. And the cancer doctors… will they call me? I like to know what’s happening, instead of just waiting. And… how long will it take for the tests? A few days? A week? I need to plan for work… if I can even go to work. And… is it… really bad? Is the cancer getting worse, do you think?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, I understand your anxiety, but it's impossible to say definitively whether the cancer is getting worse until we have the results of the tests. Jumping to conclusions will only increase your stress. Oncology will likely contact you directly to schedule a consultation, within approximately one week. The radiology department generally schedules appointments within 2-3 business days. As for your work, I will provide you with a note excusing you from work for the duration of the testing and consultation process. However, it is ultimately your decision whether to return to work before we have a clear understanding of your condition. Please refrain from self-diagnosing or searching the internet for information about your symptoms. This will only lead to unnecessary anxiety and misinformation. It's important to rely on the expertise of your healthcare team for accurate and reliable information. Do you have any further questions regarding the logistics of the testing or consultation process?
PATIENT: Okay… no internet. I’ll try. Logistics… Um… will the insurance cover all of this? I don’t want to get a big bill. I have private insurance, but… you know. Bills. And… what if the cancer is worse? What are the options? I need to know, so I can… prepare. What if there’s nothing they can do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, while I understand your concerns regarding financial matters and potential treatment options, it is premature to discuss these topics until we have a definitive diagnosis. I can assure you that our billing department will work with your private insurance to maximize coverage. However, it is impossible for me to predict the exact cost of the testing and treatment at this time. As for treatment options, these will vary depending on the extent and location of any potential cancer progression. Options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or targeted therapy. However, it is crucial to avoid speculating about treatment options until we have a clear understanding of your condition. I will address your concerns regarding potential treatment options during your follow-up appointment, after we have received the results of the testing and consulted with oncology. At this time, I can only reiterate that it is important to remain optimistic and focus on managing your symptoms. Do you have any further questions regarding the logistics of scheduling the testing or the contact information for the radiology department?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. Just… the testing. And… waiting. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll schedule the tests. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The front desk will assist you with scheduling. Have a good day. .
