DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I must say, I was expecting someone… taller. Never mind that. I’m here about getting one of those… certificates. For the marijuana. My daughter suggested it, says it’s good for what ails me. Though frankly, I’m not entirely convinced.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medical marijuana certificate. Yes, I understand. Just to be clear, you're interested in exploring that as a potential treatment option?
PATIENT: “Exploring”? Goodness, Doctor, I didn’t come here for a field trip. I came to get one, if I qualify. My daughter keeps going on about aches and pains, and sleep, and… well, it’s all rather tiresome. She says it's perfectly legal now, and a respectable woman can partake without causing a scandal. Though I do wonder about the… smell. I wouldn’t want the entire building knowing my business.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. My apologies. It’s just that, to ensure it's the right approach for you, I need to understand what specifically you're hoping to address. You mentioned aches and pains and sleep… can you tell me a little more about those?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? The aches, Doctor, are… pervasive. It’s not one particular spot, you understand. It’s everywhere. A dull throb, mostly. Especially in my joints. And the sleep… well, it comes and goes like a fickle friend. I wake up several times a night, and then I’m just… thinking. About everything. About the state of the world, about my grandchildren, about whether I locked the back door. It’s exhausting, truly. My daughter says it will “calm my mind.” Honestly, I don’t even know what that means.
DOCTOR: I see. So, widespread aches and pains, especially in your joints, and difficulty sleeping with a lot of racing thoughts. Has this been going on for a long time, or is it a more recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's crept up on me, really. The aches have been… building for several years, I suppose. But it’s gotten significantly worse in the last year or so. I blamed it on the weather, at first. But even on a lovely day like today, it’s still there. The sleep… that’s more recent. Perhaps six months or so. Before that, I slept like a log. Now? It's a constant struggle. Though I must say, worrying about all these things doesn't help the sleep, naturally. It's a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds very frustrating. And it is a cycle, as you say. Now, have you seen a doctor for this before?
PATIENT: Oh, doctors. I’ve been to a few. They all tell me the same thing: “Get more exercise.” Or “Drink more water.” As if I haven’t tried that! Honestly, Doctor, do you think I haven't considered the basics? I’ve taken a few pills over the years – something for the joints, something for the… nerves, I suppose. But they didn’t really do much good, and frankly, I don’t like being dependent on medication. That's why my daughter suggested this… alternative. It’s supposed to be natural, isn’t it? Though I still worry about the… side effects. And the smell, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's good that you're thinking critically about all of this. And you’re right to ask about side effects. We’ll certainly discuss those thoroughly. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want my history? Really, Doctor? As if a list of ailments will magically solve my problems. Very well. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered, of course. I’ve never been a sickly person, generally. Though lately… well, you see the state of me. I don’t smoke, never have. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I try to eat a healthy diet, though my daughter insists I need more fiber. Honestly, it's endless criticism. Is that what you needed to know? Do you need a list of every ache and pain I’ve ever experienced? Because I assure you, it will be a very long list.
DOCTOR: No, that's quite alright, Ellan. That gives me a good starting point. No major illnesses, gallbladder removed, occasional glass of wine, and generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. I did have a bit of a rash once, years ago, after taking some sort of antibiotic. But it went away on its own, so I don’t remember the name of it. My daughter says I should keep a list of these things, but honestly, I have more important things to worry about. Is that something you need to know specifically? Because I doubt it will be relevant. Though, now that I think about it, I did have a rather unpleasant experience with a mosquito bite last summer… a very large bump. But I hardly think that’s relevant to this whole… marijuana situation. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? Or are we just going to discuss my medical history for the next hour?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ellan, we are. And no, a mosquito bite is not what I’m looking for. Just trying to rule out any major contraindications. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Doctor, must you pry? I told you, I don't like taking medication. I take a multivitamin occasionally, if I remember. And I sometimes take a little something for my arthritis, when it's particularly bad. But it’s just an over-the-counter cream, nothing serious. I don't need a prescription for it. Honestly, I prefer to manage things myself. I don’t like being dependent on pills and potions. Is that what you wanted to know? Because if so, the answer is no. I'm not a sickly person. I just want to find a little relief from these aches and pains, and maybe get a decent night’s sleep. Is that too much to ask? And frankly, my daughter says I shouldn’t be relying on over-the-counter remedies anyway. She says they’re full of chemicals. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. And it is confusing, with so much information out there. Just to be clear, you take a multivitamin occasionally and use an over-the-counter cream for arthritis. Now, before we discuss potential options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, goodness. I hadn’t anticipated that. Must you? I mean, I came here for a certificate, not a… a prodding. I assure you, Doctor, I know my own body. I feel the aches and pains perfectly well. But… I suppose if it’s necessary. Just be gentle, please. And don’t expect me to… undress or anything. I haven’t worn a proper dress in years, and I’m not about to start now. But I suppose you’ll need to listen to my heart and lungs? And perhaps check my joints? Very well. But please be quick about it. And keep your hands to yourself, if you don’t mind. Honestly, I’ve never been comfortable with doctors poking and prodding. It’s all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I completely understand your concerns. We'll keep it brief and focused. I assure you, I'll be as gentle and respectful as possible. No undressing is required at all. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your joints, just to get a baseline. Let's start with your heart and lungs. If you could just take a deep breath for me, please. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally, with normal breath sounds. No wheezes or crackles noted. Now, I'm going to gently feel your joints. Does this cause any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that’s a bit tender, actually. Not excruciating, but… uncomfortable. It’s been bothering me for weeks, especially when I go up and down the stairs. My daughter says I should be using the elevator more, but honestly, I prefer to take the stairs. It’s good exercise, you know. But yes, that spot is definitely sore. And… now that I think about it, my right hip is a bit achy too. Not constantly, but when I walk for a long time, it starts to bother me. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather tiresome. And frankly, I’m not sure what you’re trying to find. I told you, I know my body. It’s old and achy. Is that what you wanted to hear? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. All this prodding and poking… it’s just undignified. And frankly, my daughter is going to have a field day with this. She’ll say I should have told you everything from the start. Honestly, it’s endless criticism.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ellan. It’s good we've identified those spots. Tenderness in the left knee and right hip. It's helpful to know the location and what activities aggravate it. Now, just to complete the exam, could you try and bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not very comfortable. Yes, it’s a bit stiff, you know? Not excruciating, but… restricted. I haven’t been able to bend them properly for months, actually. My daughter says I should be doing more stretches, but honestly, I don’t have the energy. And frankly, it’s embarrassing, you know? I used to be so flexible. Now? It’s a struggle just to get out of a chair. And frankly, I’m worried I’ll pull something if I try too hard. Honestly, it’s all rather depressing. Is this what you wanted to hear? I told you, I know my body. It’s old and achy. And frankly, my daughter is going to have a field day with this. She’ll say I should have told you everything from the start. Honestly, it’s endless criticism. I think I’m done with this exam. Can we please get back to the certificate?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ellan, that's enough. We've gathered enough information for now. I understand your discomfort and frustration. Flexibility is reduced in both knees, with some stiffness. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related joint pain, possibly with some osteoarthritis. It's good you're looking for ways to manage it. Now, about the medical marijuana certificate. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I believe it could potentially be a helpful option to explore, in addition to other conservative management strategies. However, it's important to have realistic expectations and understand the potential risks and benefits. Would you like me to discuss those with you?
PATIENT: “Conservative management strategies”? Goodness, Doctor, is that what you call getting old? Honestly, I just want something to relieve the aches and pains. And maybe get a decent night’s sleep. I don’t want a lecture about “lifestyle changes” or “exercise routines.” I just want the certificate. But… if you’re going to tell me about the “risks and benefits,” I suppose I should listen. Though I must say, I’m not entirely convinced this is a good idea. My daughter says it’s perfectly safe, but she also says I need to eat more fiber, so… I’m a bit skeptical. But go ahead. Tell me about these “risks and benefits.” And please, keep it brief. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late. Honestly, it’s all rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I’ll keep it brief. The potential benefits of medical marijuana for your symptoms include pain relief, improved sleep, and reduced anxiety. It can be particularly helpful for chronic pain conditions like osteoarthritis. However, there are also potential risks and side effects. These can include dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. It can also interact with other medications you may be taking, although you aren't currently on any. It's also important to be aware that the long-term effects of marijuana use are still being studied. And it's not a cure-all; it’s best used as part of a broader treatment plan. Importantly, it doesn’t work for everyone. Given your history and the exam, I believe it’s reasonable to try medical marijuana, but we'll need to monitor you closely. Are you comfortable with proceeding with the certification process?
PATIENT: “Monitor me closely”? Goodness, Doctor, am I a patient or a science experiment? Honestly, it’s all rather… overwhelming. But… I suppose if it means getting some relief from these aches and pains, I’m willing to try. But I want a guarantee. A guarantee that it will work. A guarantee that it won’t have any side effects. And a guarantee that it won’t interfere with my luncheon. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, my daughter will be furious if I don’t at least try it. She’s been going on about it for months. But if you’re going to “monitor me closely,” I want to know exactly what that entails. And I want a full refund if it doesn’t work. Honestly, it’s all rather tiresome. But… alright. Let’s proceed with this “certification process.” But I’m holding you responsible, Doctor. If this doesn’t work, I’m coming straight back here. And I’m bringing my daughter with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. I can’t offer any guarantees, unfortunately. As I mentioned, everyone responds differently, and there are inherent risks with any medication, even natural ones. However, I will do my best to support you throughout the process. The certification process involves completing a medical questionnaire and obtaining a recommendation from a licensed physician. I will fill out my portion of the paperwork based on our conversation and exam findings. You'll then need to submit it to the state registry. The “monitoring” will simply involve a follow-up appointment in a month to assess how you’re responding to the treatment and address any side effects or concerns you may have. I will also document your progress in your medical record. As for a refund, this is simply a consultation fee for my time and expertise, so I'm unable to offer a refund. Do you have any questions about the process, or would you like me to proceed with filling out the paperwork?
PATIENT: A “follow-up appointment”? More prodding and poking, I presume? Honestly, it's endless. And I suppose I have no choice but to accept this “consultation fee.” But if it doesn't work, I'm writing a strongly worded letter to the state registry. Very well. Proceed with the paperwork. But keep it brief, please. And don't ask me about my lifestyle choices. I've already told you, I eat a healthy diet and I don’t smoke. Honestly, it’s all rather tiresome. Just get it over with. And please, don't make me bend my knees again. And… is there anything I need to do before the follow-up appointment? Anything I need to… document? Because I haven't got time for endless paperwork. Honestly, I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. No further physical exam will be necessary at the follow-up appointment. And I won't ask about your lifestyle choices. I’m just completing the medical questionnaire now, documenting your symptoms and exam findings. All I’ll need from you is your signature on the release form. Here's the paperwork. Just sign at the bottom of the release form, and I’ll submit it to the state registry. It typically takes 7-10 business days to receive your certification card. For the follow-up appointment, it would be helpful if you could keep a log of how you’re feeling – any improvements in pain, sleep, or anxiety, as well as any side effects you experience. But it doesn’t need to be exhaustive. Just a brief note each day will suffice. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: "Release form"? What exactly am I releasing? Honestly, Doctor, you expect me to sign all these forms without knowing what I'm getting myself into? Very well. There. I've signed it. But if anything goes wrong, I'm holding you personally responsible. And don't expect me to keep a "log." I haven't got time for endless paperwork. But… alright. Perhaps a brief note each day. If I remember. Very well. I believe we're finished here. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I must say, I'm not entirely convinced this is a good idea. But my daughter will be pleased. I suppose that's what matters. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon to attend. And I must hurry, or I’ll be late. And please, don't expect me to keep a "log." Honestly, it’s all rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. And don’t worry about the log; just do what you’re comfortable with. I’m happy to have helped, and I wish you all the best. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a lovely luncheon.
