DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Condray. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. A lot of it, you see. It is… embarrassing, to say the least. I do not know what is causing it, but it is quite frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent gas – I understand it can be uncomfortable and definitely disruptive. Let’s try to figure out what might be going on. When did you first start noticing this increased gas?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe three months ago? Perhaps around the first week of May. It was not sudden, you understand. It just… gradually got worse. At first, it was only after certain foods. Now… well, now it is often just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset around the first week of May, starting with certain foods and now more consistent. Can you tell me a bit about which foods seem to trigger it, if any?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the foods. That is… a difficult question. Beans, certainly. And cabbage. Also, anything with a lot of… fizz. Like soda, you know? But sometimes… it happens even when I eat something very plain. Like… toast. Or a banana. It is very strange. I am quite careful about what I eat now, but it still happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so beans, cabbage, fizzy drinks are definite triggers, but it’s also happening with relatively bland foods like toast and bananas. That is a little unusual. Besides the gas itself, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the gas. No pain, no… changes in how I go to the bathroom, nothing like that. Just… a lot of air. It does make me feel a little… bloated, sometimes, but that goes away with the gas. It is mostly just… the social awkwardness of it all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no changes in bowel habits, just bloating and the gas itself. And you've noticed it's been happening more consistently despite trying to be careful with your diet. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have always been… quite healthy, actually. I have Medicare, of course, and they have run tests before, for the usual things, but everything was always… good. Nothing serious. I have not been to the hospital in… oh, maybe fifteen years? Just a check-up then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know - generally healthy, no major medical conditions, and haven't been hospitalized recently. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Never have. I have not had even a… a tooth pulled, if you can believe it. I am… lucky, I suppose, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries either. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother, she had some trouble with her stomach when she was older, but the doctors said it was just… old age. My father… he was a very strong man, never sick a day in his life. No one else… no one else had this… problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stomach trouble with your mother later in life, but nothing similar in your father or other family members. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work at the fast food place, you see. Counter work. Not much exercise, I admit. I do walk to work, though, it is not far. I do not smoke. I… sometimes have a small glass of wine with dinner. And I try to drink plenty of water. I am not… a big drinker, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, counter work, some walking, no smoking, occasional small glass of wine, and you drink water. Do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing at all. And no allergies. I have eaten… all sorts of things, over the years. Never a problem. I am very… careful about what I put in my body. Even though this gas… is happening. It is very confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, feel for any tenderness, and check your general health. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything feels relatively normal to the touch – no significant tenderness or masses. Your bowel sounds are good, and your abdomen is a little distended, which could be contributing to the gas. Your vital signs are also within normal limits – blood pressure 128/76, pulse 72, respiration 16, temperature 98.6. It doesn't seem like there's anything acutely concerning going on. Given your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to diet or mild digestive issues. To rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a basic stool test to check for any underlying infections or malabsorption issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it can help find the cause, then I am happy to do it. A stool test… is that… difficult? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: No, it's not difficult at all. The clinic will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. You’ll just collect a small sample at home, and then bring it back to the lab. The instructions will be very clear. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, let’s talk about some things you can try to manage the gas. I recommend keeping a food diary to see if you can identify any specific triggers. Also, try to eat slowly, avoid chewing gum, and limit carbonated beverages. Over-the-counter simethicone or activated charcoal can sometimes help relieve the symptoms, but they aren’t a long-term solution. If the stool test comes back normal, and the symptoms continue, we might consider a trial of a low-FODMAP diet, or a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds… quite reasonable. A food diary… I can do that. And I will try to eat more slowly. I do sometimes hurry with my lunch, I admit. I will also avoid the fizzy drinks. Simethicone… I think I have heard of that. A low-FODMAP diet… that sounds complicated. But if it is necessary, I will try my best. And a… gastroenterologist?
DOCTOR: A gastroenterologist is a specialist who focuses on the digestive system. We wouldn’t jump to that right away, but if your symptoms don’t improve with lifestyle changes and the stool test is normal, it’s something we can consider to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Okay, so let's start with the food diary, avoiding fizzy drinks, and eating more slowly. I'll order the stool test for you. The nurse will provide you with the collection kit and instructions before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. It is… embarrassing to talk about these things, you see. But you have made me feel much… calmer about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jammal. There's no need to be embarrassed – these things happen, and it's important to address them. That's what I'm here for. I’m going to print out a summary of our conversation and the instructions for the stool test. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. If you have any questions after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll follow up with you in a week to see how things are going. In the meantime, take care, and try not to worry too much. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. This is… perfect. Thank you very much for your time and your kindness. I will follow your instructions and call if I have any questions. I truly appreciate your help. I think… that is all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jammal. I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
