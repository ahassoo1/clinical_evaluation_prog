DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? Before the insurance starts. Medicare sent me. I need to make sure everything is… acceptable.
DOCTOR: Acceptable. Right. Well, a preventative check-up is always a good idea, even with insurance coverage. But let's get a bit more specific. Are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing… troubling. I feel… fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. It is all very normal. I do not understand why I need to tell you this. Is this required?
DOCTOR: It is required, Mr. Barban. It helps establish a baseline for your health. Even if you feel “fine,” there could be things we need to assess. It's a standard part of a comprehensive physical. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. My family… we are healthy people. We eat good food. We work hard. No… problems. I have never needed a doctor before this. Is this… a long process? I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s…fortunate, I suppose. Though everyone needs a doctor at some point, Mr. Barban. Alright. Past surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I have broken a finger, once, when I was a boy. But it… healed. It is fine now. We did not go to the hospital. My father fixed it. Is that something you need to know? A broken finger from many years ago?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a complete picture, Mr. Barban, even minor incidents. But we can move on. How about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My father, he is… strong. Still works. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. Old age. Nothing… specific. No sickness, really. Just… old. My brothers and sisters are also healthy. They work hard, like me. Is this what you want to hear? Everyone is… normal.
DOCTOR: Normal. Yes, alright. And what about…social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? I work. I go home. I eat. I sleep. What kind of history are you looking for? I do not go to… parties. I do not drink. I do not… smoke. I do not have any… hobbies. Is that enough social history? It is a simple life.
DOCTOR: Right. Simple. Okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My mother made sure of it. We ate all kinds of food. Spices, meats, vegetables… Everything. I have never had a reaction. I do not take any medicines, either. Not even for a headache. I just… rest. Is this taking a long time?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Let's move on to a brief physical exam, then. Could you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: The scale? Very well. It is… a large number, I suspect. I work with my hands. I am a strong man.
DOCTOR: 90 kilograms… and your height is listed as 1.88 meters. That puts your BMI at… 25.6. We'll discuss that later. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Is this normal for everyone? I do not like needles. Is there a needle involved? Tell me if there is a needle.
DOCTOR: No needles, Mr. Barban. This is just a cuff. 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: It is dusty where I work. That is probably why. All the… flour. Is that what you are listening for? Dust in my lungs? It is a normal job. Everyone has dust in their lungs.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, but I do detect some mild wheezing. Consistent with possible irritant exposure. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Relax? I am relaxed. Just… do it quickly. I do not enjoy being… poked and prodded. Is this all there is to this? A quick poke? Then I can leave?
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, let's just check your throat… say "Ah." Throat is clear. No obvious signs of infection. Alright, Mr. Barban. That completes the physical exam for now. We'll need to order some blood work to get a more complete picture of your health.
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? What for? I told you, I am fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. What will the blood work tell you that you do not already know? This is becoming… excessive. I do not understand why this is necessary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, the blood work will help us establish a baseline. It will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, liver function... things you cannot tell me just by asking if you feel fine. It’s preventative care. It's standard procedure, especially before starting Medicare coverage. We need to make sure there aren't any underlying issues. It's a simple blood draw. Do you have any known issues with giving blood?
PATIENT: Known issues? No. I have never given blood before. I do not like needles, as I have said. Is it very painful? And how long will this… process take? I have obligations this afternoon. I need to finish work. Is there a charge for this blood work? Medicare should cover it, yes? I do not want any surprises.
DOCTOR: The needle prick is quick, Mr. Barban. A momentary discomfort, certainly not agonizing. As for timing, it will take approximately 15 minutes for the blood draw itself, and then a few days for the results to come back. Medicare should cover it, but there may be a co-pay depending on your plan – you'll need to verify that with them. We'll have the lab technician draw the blood now. They’ll explain the process. Nurse Patel, could you please come in and draw blood for Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: A momentary discomfort… They always say that. This is…unacceptable. I did not agree to this… prolonged ordeal. But… very well. Let us get it over with. But if it takes too long, I will have to leave. I have things to do.
