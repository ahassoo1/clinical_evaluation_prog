DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really have time for this, but my sister said I should come. She worries too much. I just…want to make sure everything’s okay, you know? Before it’s…too late. I lost my husband last year, and well, I’d like to…start over, if you catch my drift. But I don't want any trouble getting pregnant, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive about this, and it's completely normal to want to ensure everything is healthy before planning a pregnancy, especially after a loss. So, to clarify, you’re hoping to get pregnant soon and want to have a check-up to make sure you’re in good health for that?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Look, I was healthy before, I always ate right, did everything…but things change, don’t they? I just want to know if…everything is still working, if you know what I mean. And if there’s anything I need to do. I don't want surprises. Honestly, I'm a bit embarrassed even talking about this. It should just…happen, shouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely should, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious about it, especially after some time has passed or after experiencing a loss. It’s very responsible of you to want to get checked out. And you’re right, things can change, so it's good to be thorough. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had regular check-ups with a doctor recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, recently? Not really. I mean, I went when I had to, for my husband, mostly. Before…well, it's all a blur, honestly. I think I saw someone a couple of years ago, maybe? Just the usual stuff. Blood pressure, weight… I can’t really remember what they did. It wasn't anything exciting. I mostly just try to stay healthy on my own. Do I have to go through everything? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand it feels like going over old ground, but it helps me get a complete picture of your health. It’s okay if you don’t remember everything. We can focus on the important things. Just tell me if anything significant has changed since your last check-up – any new medical problems, surgeries, or hospital stays?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Absolutely nothing. I've been perfectly fine. I told you, I take care of myself. I eat well, I sleep…okay, I try to sleep. Look, is this going to take long? I have a luncheon with some friends later, and Beatrice gets very upset if I'm late. She makes a fabulous quiche, you see, and I absolutely must be there on time. Honestly, all this worrying is probably making things worse.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s good you’re generally healthy, that’s a great starting point. Let’s quickly go through some questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to be sure everything looks good. It shouldn’t take too long. First, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none. Never had allergies. I can eat anything. Honestly, I pride myself on having a strong stomach. I've traveled all over Africa, you know. Tried everything. No, allergies. Definitely not. Can we just skip all this and get to the important part? Is there a test? A scan? Something? This is just making me stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That’s good to know. And yes, we will get to the tests. To help me decide which tests are best, I need a little more information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. I had a difficult birth with my daughter, years ago, but that’s it. Everything was…fine. Just a bit rough. They didn't need to do anything fancy. I just want to know if I can have a baby without any trouble. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, all these questions are starting to feel…invasive. I don’t see what any of this has to do with anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if the questions feel invasive. It's not my intention to upset you. The difficult birth you mentioned is actually very important information, as it can sometimes affect future pregnancies. Knowing the details will help me determine what tests, if any, are needed to ensure a smooth pregnancy. Do you remember what kind of complications you experienced during the birth?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It was years ago, I barely remember. It was long, and…painful. Lots of bleeding, I think. And they had to…push. I think. I was very young, and frankly, I was more concerned with getting it over with. My mother was very stressed, she kept saying things like “for the love of God, push!” It was…a whole ordeal. Look, can we just skip this? It’s clearly not going anywhere. Is there a test for…everything working? That's what I want to know. Not about some birth years ago. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can certainly focus on getting a test to assess your current reproductive health. Before we proceed, just a few quick questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family - things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any reproductive issues?
