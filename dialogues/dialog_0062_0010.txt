DOCTOR: Hi Jahaad, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… swelling, you said? Yes. It’s… difficult to explain precisely. It’s just… there’s swelling, mostly. I don’t recall how it started, to be honest. It feels… recent, but beyond that, I'm a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “mostly swelling.” That’s a good starting point. And you said it feels recent, but you’re not sure exactly when it started. No injury or anything that you can recall that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: No, nothing specific comes to mind. I truly don't recall any injury. I’ve been… quite busy lately, with work, and… other things. It's possible something happened and I simply didn’t notice at the time. It’s rather frustrating, I apologize. My memory hasn’t been the best as of late.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Jahaad. It's perfectly okay if you're not sure. We’ll figure it out. Can you tell me where exactly you're noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s… primarily in my face, I believe. Around my cheeks, and… under my jaw. It feels a little puffy, really. And, now that you mention it, perhaps a little around my eyes as well. It's not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit uncomfortable, perhaps. I’m not certain. It’s hard to describe precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly cheeks, under the jaw, and potentially a little around the eyes. Not painful, just noticeable and a bit uncomfortable. Has this swelling been getting worse, staying the same, or better since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe it’s… slowly getting worse. It wasn’t very prominent at first, just a slight fullness. But I feel it’s… more pronounced today than it was a few days ago, if that makes sense. It's subtle, but definitely there. I haven’t noticed any improvement, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, slowly worsening over the past few days. And no improvement. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps. But I attribute that to work, honestly. I haven't noticed anything specifically related to the swelling… no rash, no fever, no pain, as I said. I suppose… my mouth feels a little dry sometimes. But again, that could be anything. I’m really not sure if that's connected. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Jahaad. This is helpful. Fatigue and occasional dry mouth, alongside the swelling. Okay. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… that's… a bit complicated. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly for quite some time, to be honest. I’m generally healthy. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I did have a bout of… something, a few years ago. A bad infection, I think. But I recovered fully. Beyond that… not much, I believe. I’m afraid my memory is really failing me here. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I can provide the details if needed.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Jahaad. We'll take it one step at a time. Private insurance is good to know. And it’s alright if you don’t remember specifics. Just to clarify, this infection you mentioned – do you remember what kind of infection it was, or where it was located?
PATIENT: No, I'm afraid not. It was… quite a stressful time, and I mostly focused on getting better. I believe it was… a sinus infection? Or perhaps a chest infection? It involved a lot of coughing and… feeling very unwell. I was bedridden for a week or so. It was treated with antibiotics, I remember that much. But the specifics… they’re lost to me. I apologize again. It feels as though my mind is… foggy.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Jahaad. It sounds like you were quite sick. Okay, so a possible sinus or chest infection a few years ago treated with antibiotics. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions in the past, to my knowledge. I eat most foods without issue. No known drug allergies either. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I do try to be careful, though. I’m generally cautious about trying new things. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not being too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Jahaad. You're doing great. Okay, no known allergies. And you’ve said you haven’t been seeing a doctor regularly. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't take any regular medication. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as I don’t get much sun. But that’s it. No other vitamins, no supplements, nothing prescribed. I prefer to… avoid medication whenever possible, if that makes sense. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and get enough sleep, when I can.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Jahaad. Okay, just vitamin D occasionally. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked. I find it… quite unpleasant, to be honest. I avoid being around smokers whenever possible. I prioritize my health, and I believe smoking is detrimental to one’s well-being. I haven’t used any other tobacco products either. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: It does, Jahaad. Thank you. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… occasionally drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, once or twice a month. Nothing excessive. I don’t drink regularly, and I certainly don’t binge drink. I enjoy a small glass of wine on occasion, but I don’t rely on it. I believe moderation is key. Does that clarify things?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. Okay, occasional, moderate alcohol consumption. One last question for now. Are you currently under any significant stress, or experiencing any major life changes?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a difficult question. Yes, actually. I am under a fair amount of stress at work, to be honest. I’ve been… taking on more responsibility lately, and it’s proving to be quite challenging. And, yes, there have been some… personal changes as well. Nothing I’m comfortable discussing in detail at this moment, if you don’t mind. But, yes, significant stress, and some… upheaval in my life, to put it mildly. I apologize for being so vague. It’s… a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jahaad. No need to share anything you're not comfortable with. It's helpful to know you're under some stress. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just so I can get a better look at what's going on. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then take a look at your face and neck. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I’m hoping you can shed some light on this swelling. It’s… rather unsettling, to be honest. Thank you for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128 over 76, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – all within normal limits. Now, let’s take a look at your face. I’m noticing some mild swelling in your cheeks, primarily around the zygomatic bones, and a little bit of puffiness under your jawline. The skin feels… soft to the touch, and there’s no redness or warmth. I don’t feel any distinct lumps or bumps. There’s also some slight swelling around your eyelids, but it’s very subtle. It doesn't seem like there’s any significant tenderness to the touch either. I'm also checking your lymph nodes, and they don't feel enlarged. Do you feel any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: No, not pain, exactly. More… a slight discomfort. It’s not sharp, just… a pressure. It's difficult to describe. It’s a similar sensation to when I’m tired, or stressed, really. It’s not debilitating, but it’s definitely noticeable. The sensation is… localized to the area you’re pressing on. It doesn't radiate outwards. Thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate your attention to detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight discomfort with palpation of the jawline, localized to the area. That’s helpful. Let's listen to your lungs and heart just to make sure everything sounds clear. Your lungs are clear, and your heart sounds regular. No murmurs or abnormal sounds. Now, can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I hope I’m not being… difficult. I just want to be as helpful as possible. Everything feels… normal to me, but I’m no expert, of course.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being difficult at all. I’m just looking for any signs of inflammation, infection, or swelling. Everything looks normal. Your gums are healthy, your tongue appears normal, and there's no obvious sign of any sores or lesions. Okay, based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you're experiencing some mild swelling of the face, potentially related to stress and fatigue. The lack of redness, warmth, or significant pain makes a serious infection less likely. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and thyroid function. These tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues that might be contributing to the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a sensible precaution. I’m happy to proceed with whatever you deem necessary. I trust your professional judgment completely. I’m hoping it’s just stress-related, as you suggested. Thank you for taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. What is the next step, then? Do I need to schedule another appointment, or will the results be sent to me?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. The next step is to draw some blood. The lab is just down the hall, and the phlebotomist is expecting you. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll also send the results to you electronically through the patient portal. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on stress management techniques – things like getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and finding ways to relax. If the swelling worsens significantly, or if you develop any other symptoms – fever, pain, difficulty breathing – please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe you've covered everything quite thoroughly, Doctor. Thank you for your time, your patience, and your kindness. I appreciate your reassurance, and I will certainly follow your recommendations. I’ll head down to the lab now, and await the results. I’m grateful for your help. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
