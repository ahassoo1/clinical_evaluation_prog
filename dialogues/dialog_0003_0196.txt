DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Licano. I am Dr. Yackey. So, let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t even remember when it started, exactly. It just… is. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Vague symptoms are… difficult. A “while now” isn't particularly helpful for establishing a timeline, Ms. Licano. But we'll work through it. Can you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, don't I know it! It’s not like… sleepy tired. It’s more like… everything is just heavy. My arms, my legs… even thinking feels heavy. I just don’t have the energy for much. I used to… well, I used to do things. Now… Now I mostly just sit. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: "Heavy" is… descriptive, I suppose. Is this heaviness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… mostly constant, I think. Some days are worse than others, definitely. But even on the “good” days, it’s… still there. Like a weight I can’t shake. I just figured it was… getting older. Or… you know. Things. But my niece, she said I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: “Getting older” is often a perfectly reasonable explanation, Ms. Licano. Still, let's indulge your niece’s concerns. Aside from this “heaviness,” are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Um… let me think. Oh! My head sometimes aches. Not like a bad headache, just… a dull pressure. And I get… winded easily. Even walking to the mailbox feels like a big effort. And I've been… a bit forgetful, I suppose. Though, at my age, who isn’t forgetful? Honestly, I don’t know what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness can be… concerning, yes. We’ll note that. You mentioned a dull pressure in your head. Is this pressure constant, or does it come and go with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. When the tiredness is really bad, the head pressure is worse too. But if I… sit and rest, it eases up a bit. Not completely gone, but… less noticeable. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. It's just… a lot of things are fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy is not a clinical term, Ms. Licano. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh… I… honestly, I haven't really been eating much. Not because I don't want to, just… don't feel hungry. And I think… I think I've lost a little weight. I don't weigh myself often, but my clothes feel… looser. Is that important? Everything feels… unimportant these days.
DOCTOR: Weight loss and decreased appetite… yes, that is pertinent. Now, do you have any past medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… my husband, God rest his soul, he had diabetes. I helped take care of him, so I went to the doctor a lot then. But… for me? I… I don’t really remember. It’s all a bit of a blur. I’m sorry. I used to be good at keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don't think so. Maybe a tonsillectomy when I was little? But that was… a very long time ago. I really don't remember much about it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much help, am I? My memory is just… gone. Is there anything else I should be trying to remember?
DOCTOR: We’ll proceed. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh! Just… just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I think. My niece fills it for me, so I don’t even pay attention to the name. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take… something. Just a little something to help me rest. Nothing important. It's all just… a blur. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: "Something" for sleep and a small white pill for blood pressure. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I don’t think so. Nothing I know of, anyway. I haven’t had any… reactions to anything. But honestly, it’s been so long since anyone’s asked me that question. I can’t even remember what I had for breakfast this morning! Is this taking a long time? I have… things to do. Though, I can’t remember what those things are…
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, I understand you're feeling… unwell and your memory isn't cooperating, but we need to establish a clear medical history. Now, let’s move on to family history. Do any of your immediate family members – parents, siblings – have a history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… My mother… she had something with her heart. I think. She was always tired, like me. And my father… he had cancer. A long time ago. My brother… he was healthy, I think. But honestly, it was so long ago. My memory is just… gone. I'm sorry, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful. I just… can't remember. Is there anything else you need to know? Perhaps we could… stop now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s briefly address social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And a little glass of wine with dinner now and then, that's all. I certainly don't use any… those things. My husband… well, he wasn't much of a drinker either. I wouldn't know anything about those things. Can we… finish soon? I really don’t feel well.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we've established a minimal baseline. Let me conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… Must I? I… I don’t like doctors. Not that you’ve done anything, of course. It’s just… Alright. If I must. But please… be gentle?
DOCTOR: Of course. I will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Please take deep breaths. Heart rate is slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Lung sounds are diminished bilaterally, but no obvious wheezes or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly distended. No organomegaly palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Peripheral pulses are weak. Your blood pressure is 110/70. I will need to order some laboratory tests to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh… that didn't hurt, I suppose. But everything feels… strange, you know? Like I'm floating. Tests? What kind of tests? And… will they hurt? I don’t like needles. I really don't. I’ve always been… faint.
DOCTOR: Standard blood work: a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D level. We'll also order a urinalysis. Yes, there will be a small needle prick for the blood draw, but it's quite brief. The results will help us determine the cause of your fatigue, weight loss, and diminished lung sounds. I would also like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung pathology.
PATIENT: Oh dear… a chest X-ray…? Is something wrong with my lungs? You said something about them being… quiet. And needles… I really don’t like needles. I… I think I’m going to be sick. Is there a nurse here? I need a nurse.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Licano, try to remain calm. Your lungs were merely diminished, not necessarily abnormal. A chest X-ray is a precautionary measure. I will have a nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Nurse, please come to room three. Ms. Licano requires a blood draw and an X-ray order. I assure you, it will be over before you know it. Now, I will write out the orders. Try to take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Oh… Please… hurry. I just want to go home. Everything is spinning. I think I’m going to… .
