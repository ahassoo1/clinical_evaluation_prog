DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Gentz, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Brad Gentz. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, but… well, things came up. Not a fan of waiting rooms, either, if you want to know the truth. Waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We all have our preferences. So, what exactly came up that brought you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… blood. A lot of it. Not like a paper cut, you understand. More… internal. Been happenin’ for a couple days now. Thought it was somethin’ I ate at first, but it ain’t stoppin’. And honestly, it’s a bit much, even for me. You get what I mean?
DOCTOR: “A bit much,” is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Gentz. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Fine. It's comin’ out… down there. When I, uh, use the bathroom. Dark red, sometimes with… bits in it. And it's makin' me weak. Real weak. Not just a little tired, like after a long day. I’m talkin’ shaky, gotta sit down kinda weak. Satisfied now?
DOCTOR: Right. So, rectal bleeding for two days, accompanied by weakness. Have you experienced any pain, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More like… discomfort. A kinda crampin’ feelin’ sometimes. And when… well, when it’s happenin’. Not enough to send me runnin’ for the painkillers, if that’s what you're askin’. I’ve had worse stubbed toes, honestly. You need me to draw you a picture?
DOCTOR: No, a picture is unnecessary. And dismissing symptoms as being “worse than a stubbed toe” is… unhelpful. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the bleeding?
PATIENT: Changes? Look, I'm a man who likes routine. I go when I go, you understand? It’s… consistent. But now? It’s… thinner, I guess. Not like solid logs anymore, if you catch my drift. More… mushy. And it takes effort, if you know what I mean. Like I'm strainin' a bit more than usual. Is that detailed enough for ya? I’m not exactly thrilled discussin’ this, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever. No throwin’ up, thankfully. Nauseous? Maybe a little queasy this mornin', but that coulda been the coffee. I drink strong coffee, you understand? Keeps me goin’. But no… nothin’ dramatic. Just the bleedin’ and the… mushy situation. Look, doc, I’m not a delicate flower. I just want to know what’s goin’ on and how to fix it. No need for a whole life story, alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, your chart indicates you have no established primary care physician and haven’t had a recent physical exam. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. It will include a rectal exam.
PATIENT: A what exam? You’re kiddin’ me, right? Look, I told you what’s wrong. You don’t need to… poke around. I’m not comfortable with that. Not at all. I came here for answers, not… that. Is there another way? Some kind of… scan or somethin’? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your discomfort, but a physical examination is necessary to properly assess your condition. It’s standard procedure. Without it, I cannot rule out serious causes for your symptoms. We need to determine the source of the bleeding. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be… more serious. A scan will not provide the information I need. I strongly advise you to allow me to conduct a thorough examination. If you continue to refuse, I'm afraid I cannot offer much assistance.
PATIENT: You’re tellin’ me what you can and can’t do? Look, I came here lookin' for help, not a lecture. And I'm not havin' anyone pokein' around down there. It's my body, I’ll decide what happens to it. Forget it. I’ll deal with it myself. Wasted my whole afternoon. A whole afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, refusing medical evaluation is your prerogative, but I strongly advise against it. Your symptoms warrant further investigation. Patient refused examination and discharge against medical advice. I wish you well. .
