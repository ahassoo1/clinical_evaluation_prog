DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Yackey. Now, if you could just tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? Right here on my shins. They’re red and kinda…hard. They hurt, especially when I’m walking around. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bumps, you say. And how long precisely is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh, geez, let me think… maybe a month or so? It started with just one, and I didn’t think much of it. Then another one popped up, and another… now there’s a good handful. It’s not getting worse fast, but it’s definitely not going away on its own. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A month. Right. And have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, really. I work outside a lot, moving stuff around, so they get bumped sometimes, that definitely makes ‘em hurt more for a bit. But I haven’t noticed anything that makes them feel better, no. I tried putting some lotion on ‘em, but that didn’t do much. You know, just regular lotion. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Lotion. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I just got the bumps, Doctor. No fever, no… aches, nothing like that. Just the pain in my legs when I walk. I feel okay otherwise, just a little tired from work, you know? Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Not that I know of, Doctor. My wife, she always makes sure I eat right, but nobody in my family’s ever been told they had it. I get checked up at the clinic sometimes, for my blood pressure, but they never said anything about diabetes. Is that what these bumps could be from?
DOCTOR: It could be. We'll need to rule things out. Let's move on to your medical history. Any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a mango tree when I was a kid. Nothing major lately, though. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old. I've got high blood pressure, like I said, but I take pills for that. My wife keeps track of everything. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication. And what medications are you currently taking for that, specifically?
PATIENT: Let me think… uh… it’s a little white pill. I think it’s called… lisinopril? Yes, lisinopril! That’s it. I take one every morning with my breakfast. My wife gets it filled at the pharmacy down the street. She knows the name better than I do, honestly. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything, Doctor! Filipino food, you know, we use a lot of different things. Never had a reaction to anything. And I haven’t changed my soaps or anything like that recently. I’ve been using the same stuff for years.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a quick look at these bumps. Please point out any areas that are particularly painful.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Go ahead. This one here, right on the shinbone, that one hurts a lot when I press on it. And this one too, over here… yeah, that’s a tender spot. They’re all a little sore, but those two are the worst.
DOCTOR: Alright. They are warm to the touch and firm. I’m noting some redness around the nodules. It could be a localized reaction, or something vascular. We’ll need to rule out shin splints as well. I'm going to order a CBC and CMP, just to get a baseline. We will also perform a lipid panel.
PATIENT: CBC and… what now? Lipid… panel? Doctor, are those blood tests? What are we looking for? I just want to know what’s wrong with my legs! Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Yes, they are blood tests. CBC checks your blood count, CMP assesses your organ function, and the lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels. It's standard procedure, Mr. Aluia. We need to gather information. It's unlikely to be serious, but we need to rule things out. Do you have any family history of vascular disease?
PATIENT: Vascular… disease? Hmm… I don’t think so. My mother, she had high blood pressure too, but she lived to be 85! My father, he was a strong man, worked in the fields all his life. Nobody ever talked about… vascular disease. Is that like, problems with the blood vessels? My wife might know more about that, she reads a lot of those medical websites.
DOCTOR: Yes, problems with the blood vessels. Alright. I'm going to write you a referral to a vascular specialist for a consultation. They can perform further testing, such as a Doppler ultrasound, to assess blood flow in your legs. The lab is just down the hall. Once you have the results, schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… Okay. A specialist, huh? That sounds… serious. Will these tests tell me what’s causing the pain? And… how long will it take to get the results? I need to get back to work, you know. I can't be off for too long.
DOCTOR: The tests will help determine the cause of your pain, Mr. Aluia. The results typically take a few days to a week. I suggest you call Dr. Ramirez's office to schedule the appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and elevate your legs when possible. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, a few days to a week… I’ll call Dr. Ramirez first thing tomorrow. And I'll try to take it easy, I guess. My wife will be glad to hear that. No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. Thank you for looking at my legs. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia. .
