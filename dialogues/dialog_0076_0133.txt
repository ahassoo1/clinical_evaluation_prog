DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Tippens, yes. Seventy-six, right. And… Mexican heritage. Look, I’m a busy man, so let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Seventy-six. And yes, Mexican, on both sides of the family. Honestly, it’s just these forms. I need them notarized, I think? They're for… well, some health things. I don't really understand all the paperwork, and I don't have insurance, so I figured I needed to come here. Is that right? Do you do the notarizing?
DOCTOR: Notarizing?
PATIENT: Well, that's what the lady on the phone said I needed. She said you could… verify them? I just need them signed and official-looking so I can get this all sorted out. It's for a program… something about help with costs. I’m not very good with details, you see. Is this not something you do here?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Tippens, I'm a doctor. I treat patients. I don’t… stamp papers. This isn’t a notary public. You need to go somewhere else for that. But… since you're here, and I have a few minutes before my next patient… tell me what these “health things” are that you need the forms for. Maybe I can actually help you, instead of wasting time on bureaucracy.
PATIENT: Oh! Well, that's good to know. I was worried I’d come to the wrong place. It's… it's about my knees, really. They’ve been bothering me for a while now. Just getting worse and worse. I'm having trouble walking, and the pain keeps me up at night. I need these forms to apply for some assistance with… well, with getting them looked at properly. Maybe even fixed, if that's possible. I just don’t have the money to do it on my own, you see. Is this something you can help me with?
DOCTOR: Knees… right. Any recent injuries?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Just… years, you know? Years of working and walking and life. It’s just a slow ache that gets sharper when I move around a lot. And now it's even hurting when I don't move around much, if you can believe it. I used to be able to garden all day, but now… now I can barely get to the mailbox.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any swelling?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not always. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on them for a while. And it’s definitely worse when it’s hot or humid. It doesn’t feel hot to the touch, if that makes sense. Just… puffy. Like they’re filled with water. It goes down if I rest, but it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said pain keeps you up at night?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s the worst part. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. It's more of a… throbbing ache. It just keeps me tossing and turning. I try to take something to help me sleep, but it doesn't always work. And I don't like taking pills if I don't have to. It makes me feel… foggy, you know? I just want to sleep through the night. Is there anything you can recommend? Something that doesn't involve a lot of medication?
DOCTOR: Well, "not involving a lot of medication" isn't really a medical treatment, Mrs. Tippens. We need to figure out what's causing the pain. Have you had any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, no. Not really. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, when I was younger. And I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. But nothing serious. I used to be very healthy. Oh! And I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. But I try to watch my salt intake. Is that important? It doesn't bother me, usually. I just… try to take care of myself. That's all. It's just these knees now. It’s getting so hard to do anything.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure... are you taking anything for that?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. The doctor gave me a pill to take when it gets really high, but it doesn't happen very often. I try to control it with my diet. Less salt, you know? I don't really like taking pills, even for the blood pressure. I just don't want to be dependent on them. Is that silly? It's just... I like being independent. And I don't have much money for all these doctor visits and medications. It’s hard enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just see the knees. Please.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Be careful, they’re a little sensitive. I’ll try to hold still. Here they are. You can see they’re a bit swollen. And red, sometimes. I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some crepitus. And tenderness here and here… Swelling is mild, as you said. Range of motion… limited, but not severely. It's likely osteoarthritis, given your age and symptoms. Though, we should probably get an X-ray just to confirm.
PATIENT: Osteo… what-itis? Is that bad? And an X-ray… does that cost a lot of money? I don’t have a lot of extra money, you see. I just want to be able to walk without pain again. Is there anything… anything at all I can do in the meantime? Some kind of cream, or something? Or exercises? Anything to help ease the pain a little? I really appreciate you taking the time to look at them. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: "Osteoarthritis" is wear and tear. Common. An X-ray will give us a better idea of the severity. As for cream… topical creams won’t do much for this. We could try some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, but those have side effects. And, frankly, at your age… We need to see what the X-ray shows. I'll write you a referral to the imaging center. But honestly, don't get your hopes up. It's likely you'll need physical therapy, and possibly injections. Which, again, cost money.
PATIENT: Injections… Physical therapy… Well. That’s… that’s a lot. I don't know if I can afford all that. Is there anything… is there any help available for people who don’t have insurance? I really appreciate you being honest with me, though. It’s just… it's hard to hear. I just wanted to be able to walk to the mailbox again. Do you… do you know of any programs that might help with the costs? Even a little bit would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Honestly?
