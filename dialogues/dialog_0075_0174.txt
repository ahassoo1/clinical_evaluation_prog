DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Panjoj. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were more cheerful. I’m here because… well, I haven’t been myself lately. I just feel… down. A great deal. I suppose that’s what you call depression, yes? I’m not one for dwelling on things, so I thought best to get it sorted. If you don’t mind me saying, I’d like to be quick about this visit, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. It's perfectly understandable to want to address these feelings and get things sorted efficiently. I appreciate your directness. “Feeling down” can certainly be a sign of depression, but it’s important to explore what that means for you. I see here you’re 75 years old. Has this feeling of being down been a recent change, or something you’ve experienced on and off for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, seventy-five years… it feels like yesterday and a lifetime ago, all at once. As for how long… that’s a bit difficult to say precisely. It hasn't been sudden, no. More… a creeping in. Perhaps the last six months, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint. Things just… lost their shine, I suppose. I used to be quite active, you know. Ski patrol, lifeguarding... kept me busy. Now… well, now it feels like an effort just to get out of bed some days.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset is very common, and it sounds like it’s significantly impacting your daily life, which is important to address. So, six months of a loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, and some days feeling low enough to make it difficult to get out of bed. Besides the loss of enjoyment and difficulty getting out of bed, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite hasn’t been the best, I must admit. I’m not eating nearly as much as I used to, though I don’t go without food, mind you. Just… not enjoying it. And I haven’t been sleeping well either. I wake up often, very early, and then I can’t get back to sleep. I find myself just… staring at the ceiling. Not particularly worrying thoughts, just… awake. Does that make sense? And… I suppose I’ve been a bit more irritable than usual. My housekeeper has noticed it, bless her heart. She’s a very patient woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Derasmo. Those are all common symptoms – decreased appetite, difficulty sleeping, and increased irritability. It sounds like it’s affecting multiple areas of your life. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of death or self-harm?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather direct question, isn’t it? No, no thoughts of that sort. Not at all. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I've lived a full life, seen a great deal. I wouldn’t… I don’t want to end things. It's just… tiring. Everything feels… heavy. I just wish it would… lift. I certainly don’t want to cause anyone trouble. That’s not my way. Hopelessness… perhaps a little, yes. That things won't get better. But not… thoughts of ending it. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Derasmo. It's very important to ask those questions, and I appreciate your honesty. It's good to hear you aren’t experiencing thoughts of self-harm. Now, let's talk a bit about your past. Have you ever experienced depression or anxiety before, or received any mental health treatment in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I mean, everyone gets sad now and then, of course. Life has its ups and downs. But this… this is different. I’ve always been a strong woman, relied on myself. I built a good life, a successful career. Ski patrol was demanding, lifeguarding even more so. You had to be alert, responsible. I never really had time for… worrying. Or feeling sorry for myself. I suppose I just… dealt with things. No treatments, no therapy, nothing of the sort. I always considered it a bit of a weakness, to be honest. Though, perhaps I was wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to have never experienced depression before later in life, and it takes courage to acknowledge that things might be different now. And it’s perfectly alright to change your mind about seeking help; it doesn’t diminish your strength at all. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m generally quite healthy, if I do say so myself. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, nothing major. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which isn’t surprising given my line of work. I’ve always been careful to stay active, though it’s become a bit more difficult lately, as I mentioned. I have private insurance, so that shouldn’t be an issue. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially – a glass of wine with dinner now and then. No allergies, and I'm not currently taking any medications, besides a mild pain reliever for my knees when they flare up. Oh, and I had the flu shot last winter, of course. I’m very careful about that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you've been proactive about your health, which is excellent. So, no major medical conditions, gallbladder removed ten years ago, some arthritis in the knees, no known allergies, and not currently on any regular medications aside from occasional pain relief. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother… she was a very private woman. Never spoke much about her feelings. She was… stoic, I suppose. My father was a businessman, always very focused on his work. Neither of them ever sought any kind of help, if that’s what you mean. I have a younger brother, but we haven’t been close since we were children. I don’t know anything about his life, to be honest. He moved to America many years ago and we lost touch. So, no, not that I am aware of. Not a family history of… that sort of thing. It was always just… keep calm and carry on, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to know about family history, and sometimes those things aren't openly discussed. So, no known family history of depression or anxiety. Finally, let’s talk a little about your social life. Do you have a strong support system – friends, family, or community groups?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a sore point, actually. I was divorced many years ago, and, as I said, I haven’t been close to my brother for a long time. I have a housekeeper who’s very kind, but she’s… employed help, you understand. I used to have a few friends from my ski patrol days, but they’ve all moved away or… well, life happens. I’m not very involved in any community groups. I used to be quite busy with work, you see, and then… after the divorce, I just sort of… withdrew. I live alone, Doctor. It’s… quiet. Perhaps too quiet. I manage, of course. But it’s… lonely.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Derasmo. It takes courage to admit that things are lonely. It sounds like you’ve been through some significant life changes, and it's understandable that you're feeling the effects. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me – the persistent low mood for six months, loss of interest, changes in appetite and sleep, increased irritability, and a lack of a strong support system – it does sound like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. It’s important to remember this isn’t a sign of weakness, and it is treatable. I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to rule out any other potential medical causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds sensible. Rule out anything else. Though, frankly, I suspect it’s just… this feeling. This… weight. Please proceed. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. The quicker, the better, if you don't mind me saying. I haven't got all day, you know. Though I appreciate you listening. It's… a relief to talk about it, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Of course. And I understand wanting to be efficient. We'll do our best. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is normal at 98.6. Heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft. I’m also going to quickly check your reflexes and neurological function. Reflexes are normal and your neurological function appears intact. Everything appears physically normal, which supports the possibility of depression being the primary cause of your symptoms. Now, to help confirm this, I’d like to have you complete a short questionnaire called the PHQ-9. It’s a standard tool used to assess the severity of depression symptoms. It will just take a few minutes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. A questionnaire. Fine. The less talking, the better, frankly. Please proceed. And if you could explain how to fill it out quickly, I’d be grateful. I’m not one for complicated forms, you understand. Just the basics.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s very straightforward. It asks you how often you’ve been bothered by different feelings over the last two weeks. For each statement, simply check one box: “Not at all,” “Several days,” “More than half the days,” or “Nearly every day.” There are no right or wrong answers, just be honest about how you’ve been feeling. I’ll be right here if you have any questions. Take your time, but feel free to call me over when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s get this over with. …Right. I believe I’ve finished. There. Let’s see what it says. I suspect it won't be cheerful reading.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. Based on your responses on the PHQ-9 questionnaire, it appears you are experiencing moderate depression. It’s important to reiterate that this is a common and treatable condition. There are several options we can consider. One is medication, which can help regulate the chemicals in your brain that affect mood. Another is psychotherapy, or talk therapy, which can provide you with coping strategies and support. We could also explore a combination of both. Given your preference for efficiency, we could start with a low dose of an antidepressant medication. However, it’s crucial to understand that it can take several weeks to see the full effects. We would need to monitor you closely for any side effects. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm. I’m not particularly keen on taking pills, if I’m honest. I always considered it a last resort. But if it’s the quickest way to… alleviate this feeling… I suppose I’m willing to try. As long as it’s a low dose, as you say, and doesn’t have too many side effects. I haven’t got time for complications, you understand. Psychotherapy… talk therapy… frankly, that sounds rather… drawn-out. And I don’t really enjoy discussing my feelings. It feels… undignified. So, yes. Medication. If it’s the quickest path, let’s try that. But I want to be clear: I expect results. And I don’t want to be on it indefinitely. What kind of side effects should I be aware of? And how long before I should expect to see a difference?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Derasmo. I respect your preferences. We can certainly start with medication. I was thinking of prescribing Sertraline, a commonly used antidepressant with generally mild side effects. Common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, or insomnia, especially in the first few weeks. These usually subside on their own. More rarely, some people experience sexual side effects or weight changes. We’ll discuss these in detail before you start the medication, and I’ll be monitoring you closely for any concerns. As for how long before you see a difference, it typically takes 4-6 weeks to start noticing some improvement in your mood and energy levels. It’s important to be patient and consistent with the medication, even if you don't feel an immediate effect. I'm prescribing a low dose of Sertraline, 50mg daily. I’ll also give you a pamphlet with more information about the medication and potential side effects. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment with you in four weeks to assess your progress. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or experience any troubling side effects. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Four weeks… yes, that sounds reasonable. And thank you for the information about the side effects. I shall keep a close watch. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this time. Just… let’s hope this works. I haven’t got time for this, you understand. Thank you, Doctor Panjoj. You’ve been… efficient. That’s all I ask. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have errands to run. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Derasmo. I understand. I wish you all the best, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We'll monitor your progress closely. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in four weeks.
