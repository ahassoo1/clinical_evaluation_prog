DOCTOR: Right. Janeth Micucci, 60 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s not really a problem problem, you understand. More of… a nice thing to have. My daughter, she says I should get a card. A “get well” card, or an “encouragement” card. From you. You know, to show people I’m… being looked after. It’s just a formality, really. She’s very particular, that one.
DOCTOR: A card… Right. So, to be clear, you’re here for a note… for documentation purposes, essentially?
PATIENT: Documentation? No, no. Not like that. It's... well, my sister, she’s been poorly. Very poorly. And everyone keeps asking me how I am doing. It’s just… awkward. It would be much easier if I could say the doctor is sending me encouragement. You know? A little note to show I have support. It’s just common courtesy, really. People expect these things.
DOCTOR: So, you're requesting a statement… acknowledging your emotional well-being, so you can relay it to acquaintances?
PATIENT: Emotional well-being? Oh, goodness. It's not about me being emotional. It’s about… appearances. My sister’s family… they think I should be falling apart. They expect a lot. And honestly, I’m just… tired of answering questions. A card from you, a proper doctor, would just make things… simpler. Is that so hard to understand? It’s just good manners, really. Everyone does it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're requesting a… social communication, framed as medical support, to manage external expectations regarding your sister’s illness. And you want me to… facilitate this?
PATIENT: Facilitate? Oh, don’t use such fancy words, Doctor. It’s a card. A simple “thinking of you” card. Really, it’s quite straightforward. You write something nice, I show it to my relatives, and everyone is happy. Is it really so difficult to grasp? You're a doctor! People listen to doctors! It's about… respect, you see. They respect you, therefore they’ll respect me for having your support. It’s a very sensible arrangement, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. And to clarify, this has no bearing on your own health?
PATIENT: Oh, my health is fine. Perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps, but who isn't? It's about… navigating social situations, you understand? My sister’s daughter… she’s very judgmental. Always has been. She’ll question everything. And it’s much easier if she thinks you are taking care of things. A card just… avoids a lot of unpleasantness. Honestly, it’s a small thing to ask. A simple card. It’s not like I’m asking for surgery!
DOCTOR: So, you’re seeking a… professionally-authored social buffer. Essentially, a document to preemptively address potential inquiries regarding your emotional state. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Professionally-authored social buffer? Honestly, Doctor, you make it sound so… complicated! It’s a card! A little piece of paper with nice words on it. It’s about politeness, respect, and… frankly, peace and quiet. It's not about me needing support, it's about them expecting it. And if you write it, they’ll stop asking. It's a very simple solution to a very silly problem. Do you think you can manage a simple card, or is that too much to ask? It really isn’t a difficult task.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, with all due respect, I am a medical professional. My time is allocated to patients with actual medical needs. While I understand you are experiencing… social pressure, I’m not equipped to provide documentation for what essentially amounts to a family dispute. I can document your vital signs, if you’d like. Otherwise, I suggest speaking with a counselor.
PATIENT: A counselor? A counselor? Honestly! Do you think I haven’t tried talking to people? This isn’t about feelings, it’s about expectations. And frankly, it’s about respect for a proper doctor’s note! Everyone knows a doctor’s word carries weight. A counselor… well, that’s just… silly. It’s a card, Doctor. A simple card. You write a few words, I show it to my family, and everyone is happy. You're a doctor, for goodness sake! Is that too much to ask? Really, I’m starting to think I’ve wasted my time. It's not difficult, it's just… common courtesy. I suppose I’ll just have to deal with it myself. It’s a shame. A real shame.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Micucci, I am documenting this conversation for legal purposes. I suggest you seek alternative methods for managing your family dynamics. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Legal purposes? Honestly! Legal purposes… a simple card… the nerve…
