DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I am noticing things. My memory, it is…not as good. I forget small things, things I should remember easily. It worries me, as my blood pressure is…high. I want to understand what is happening, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’re experiencing some memory difficulties, and you’re concerned about a potential link to your high blood pressure. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of these memory issues. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: It was…around maybe three months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It is hard to say exactly. At first, it was just misplacing keys, forgetting what I ate for lunch. Small things. But now…now I worry I am forgetting more important details. It is frightening, Doctor. I have always had a good memory.
DOCTOR: Three months, okay. And you say it's progressed—more significant details now. Can you give me a specific example of something important you’ve recently forgotten?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Last week, Mrs. Petrova, she asked me about the community garden meeting. I knew I had scheduled it, I had it in my calendar…but I could not recall the date. I had to check with the other board members to find out. It was…embarrassing. I manage the association, I should have known immediately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty recalling scheduled events, even those you’ve actively planned. And you manage the association, so maintaining those details is important for your work. Do you find yourself repeating questions, or asking the same information multiple times?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not constantly, but…yes. I might ask my assistant the same thing twice in one hour. Or ask my husband about something he just told me. He gets…impatient, understandably. It is not like me to be so forgetful. It is…unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. I…I do feel more tired lately. Always a little tired, but now…it is harder to get going in the morning. And sometimes, I have trouble finding the right word when I speak. Not all the time, but it is there. A…a blank space, in my mind. It is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and difficulty with word finding. Okay. Let’s move onto some other things to get a more complete picture. Do you have any history of neurological issues—stroke, head injury, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very healthy, all my life. A little high blood pressure, managed with medication, but nothing else. No injuries, no…problems with my brain, ever. I assure you. My mother…she had some arthritis, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of neurological issues. And your mother had arthritis. Now, do you take any other medications besides what you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see…just a vitamin D supplement. My doctor recommended it, for the winters. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache. But that is all. I do not like taking many pills, if I can avoid it. It makes me feel…weak.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. And you prefer to avoid medication when possible. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about some other things, just to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision…? No, not really. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I blame my reading. I do a lot of paperwork for the association. I wear glasses, you see. But no sudden changes, no spots, nothing like that. I had an eye exam last year, everything was fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant vision changes. And a normal eye exam last year. Now, are you experiencing any difficulties with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance…no. I do not fall, I do not stumble. I walk normally, I can manage the stairs. Perhaps a little slower than before, but that is just age, I suppose. Nothing to be concerned about. I am still very steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior—feeling depressed, anxious, or more irritable than usual?
PATIENT: Well…I am a little more worried than usual, if that counts. I do not sleep well when I worry. And yes, I suppose I am a little irritable. It is frustrating to forget things, it makes me angry with myself. But I wouldn’t say…depressed. Just…concerned. And a little tired, as I said before. My husband says I am more quiet lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Alvara, thank you for answering those questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. It will just involve checking your reflexes, balance, and a few simple memory tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. I want to know what is happening. The sooner, the better. Please, let us proceed. I do not mind at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step over here and have a seat, we'll begin with your blood pressure. Then we'll move on to the neurological assessment. Please relax your arm, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Very well. I do my best to relax, Doctor. It is not always easy when one is worried. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. Not ideal, but consistent with what we’ve seen before. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please close your eyes. Good, good. Reflexes are normal. Now, let's check your balance. Could you stand up slowly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am standing. It is a little difficult sometimes, but I can manage. Please, tell me what to do next. I am trying to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes again. And please walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps. Just take your time. It’s alright if you need to stop.
PATIENT: Oh…Doctor? I…I feel a little unsteady. Perhaps I should sit down. It is…difficult to balance with my eyes closed. I apologize. It is not usually like this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. It's important to be safe. You're doing fine. Okay, now let's do a simple memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am ready. Please, tell me the words. I will try my best to remember them. I am a little anxious, but I will concentrate.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are "apple", "table", and "pencil". Repeat them back to me, please.
PATIENT: "Apple…table…pencil." I believe I have them. Is that correct, Doctor? I hope I did not misunderstand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, we'll move on to some other questions. But first, I'm going to ask you to recall those three words again. Just tell me whatever you remember. Don’t worry if you don’t get them all.
PATIENT: Hmm… "Apple…I remember apple. And… table. Yes, table. But the third one… the third one is… escaping me. I believe it was something you write with… a… a pen? No, not a pen. It was… small and wooden. Oh dear. I cannot recall it. I am so sorry. It is…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Based on the information you’ve provided, the physical exam findings – the slight instability when walking with your eyes closed – and the memory test results, I think it is important to investigate this further. While it’s possible these symptoms are related to stress or high blood pressure, the memory difficulties and balance issues warrant a more thorough evaluation. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive neurological assessment. This will involve more detailed cognitive testing and possibly an MRI of the brain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? An MRI…? Oh dear. That sounds…serious, Doctor. Is it…is it something to be very concerned about? I was hoping it was just stress, or my blood pressure… But a neurologist… That is frightening. What…what are you concerned about, exactly? I understand you need to investigate, but…could you explain it to me in simpler terms, please? And…how long will this take? I do not want to be kept waiting for answers.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. It is best to be thorough. The symptoms you're experiencing—the memory difficulties, fatigue, and balance issue—could be caused by several things. Stress and high blood pressure can certainly contribute, but we need to rule out other possibilities. A neurologist is a specialist in the brain and nervous system. They will perform more detailed tests to assess your cognitive function, reflexes, and overall neurological health. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that allows us to visualize your brain and identify any structural abnormalities. We're not necessarily looking for anything specific at this point, but it’s important to rule out conditions like a minor stroke, vitamin deficiencies, or early signs of cognitive impairment. It does not automatically mean something serious is wrong. As for timing, I can get the blood test orders to you today. The neurologist appointment may take a few weeks to schedule, depending on their availability. I will do my best to expedite the process. Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is…reassuring, to hear you say it doesn't automatically mean something serious. A few weeks for the neurologist…that is acceptable. I suppose it is best to be cautious. The blood tests…what exactly will they be testing for? And…will I need to fast beforehand? I do not want to be unprepared. I also…will the neurologist contact me directly, or will you handle the scheduling and results? I am not very good with…medical arrangements, if I am honest. My husband usually handles those things, but he is away on business at the moment.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood tests will assess your vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, glucose levels, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying deficiencies or imbalances that could contribute to your symptoms. We will also check your inflammatory markers. Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I will handle the scheduling of the neurologist appointment, and I will also receive the results of your blood tests. I will then contact you to discuss the findings and schedule the neurologist appointment. I understand medical arrangements can be overwhelming, especially when you're already concerned. I’m happy to assist you every step of the way. Here is the lab order form. You can take this to any certified lab. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is very kind of you. No sugary drinks…I can manage that. And you will contact me directly…that is a relief. I do not want to trouble my assistant with these things. Just one more question, if you don’t mind. You mentioned…cognitive impairment. What exactly does that mean? Is it…Alzheimer’s? I am…somewhat frightened to ask, but I would rather know, than worry in silence. And…if it is something like that…what are the treatment options? I understand this is a lot to ask, but…I am very anxious about this.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that you're anxious, Ms. Alvara. It's important to address your concerns directly. “Cognitive impairment” is a broad term that refers to any decline in mental function – memory, thinking, language, and judgment. It can be an early sign of conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, but it can also be caused by many other things that are treatable and reversible – medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, infections, or even stress and depression. It’s far too early to jump to any conclusions about Alzheimer’s. We need to get the results of your blood tests and the neurologist's assessment before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. If it were to be diagnosed as a cognitive impairment, there are treatment options available. These include medications to help manage the symptoms, as well as lifestyle modifications – regular exercise, a healthy diet, and cognitive stimulation – to help slow the progression of the disease. There are also many support groups and resources available for individuals with cognitive impairment and their families. But again, let's focus on getting the information we need first. We're taking things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is…very reassuring to hear. One step at a time…yes, that is what I must do. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I think…I think that is all the questions I have for now. I will schedule the blood tests tomorrow, and I will await your call. Thank you again for your time and your help, Doctor Versace. I feel…less anxious, knowing that we are taking things seriously. I will…try not to worry too much. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
