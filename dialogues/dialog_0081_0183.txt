DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Fatigue. I am… very tired. All the time tired. Not good tired, just… there tired. Been this way a while now, you see. Doctor told me liver… something a few years back. That the trouble, I think.
DOCTOR: "A while now"... can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Let me think. Maybe… two years? Two years since I started noticing. Before that, I was working hard, always busy. Now… even lifting a bag of rice is too much. My wife, she does everything now. It is… not ideal. You understand. A man should work.
DOCTOR: I understand. And this fatigue – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Like a… a weight. Always there. Some days heavier, some days… less heavy, maybe. But always there. Even when I sleep… still tired when I wake up. Not refreshing sleep. Just… more tired. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Grumman. You mentioned a doctor previously noted something with your liver a few years ago. Do you recall what was specifically diagnosed or treated at that time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Doctor… old doctor in the city. He said… something about the liver not working right. Too much… fat, he said. Something about drinking too much… but that was years ago! I barely drink now. He gave me pills, orange pills. Took them for a while, then stopped. Didn’t seem to do much. I forget the name of the pills, and the name of the doctor, to be honest. Old age, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll need to look into those records, if possible. Before we do that, let’s get a more complete picture of your health. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… My stomach, sometimes it hurts. Not all the time, but when it hurts… it's a bad hurt. And… I've been losing weight. Not trying to, just… smaller clothes fit now. My wife keeps saying I need to eat more. And… sometimes my skin feels itchy. Very itchy. Like little bugs crawling on me, but there are no bugs. It’s annoying. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Stomach pain, weight loss, and itching… those could all be related. Now, regarding the stomach pain – where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like?
PATIENT: It's… here. Right under my ribs. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes sharp, like a knife, but not often. It comes and goes. After I eat something… sometimes it gets worse. Not always, but often. Heavy food, like meat… makes it bad. My wife makes fish, that's okay. Less trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’re building a picture here. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Aside from the liver issue you mentioned, have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: No, no other conditions. Just… old age aches and pains. You know. Back hurts sometimes, knees crack. Normal things. Never been in the hospital, except when I broke my arm when I was a boy. Fell out of a tree. Silly boy. Nothing serious, ever. I’m a strong man, always been strong. Until this tiredness… it’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them. Always been lucky, I guess. A few stitches here and there when I was younger, working with tools. But no proper surgery. Never. I don’t like hospitals. Too many sick people. Bad for the spirits.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he lived a long life. Worked hard, farmer. Healthy man. My mother, she died young, sickness. I don't remember what sickness. Ethiopia, you see. Not many doctors then. Nobody talked much about it. My brother, he is still alive, lives in Addis Ababa. He is healthy, I think. We don’t talk often. Far away. Not much to say, really. It’s not important, is it? I’m the one who’s sick now.
DOCTOR: It's good to have some information, even if limited. Now, tell me about your social history, Mr. Grumman. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked. Bad for the lungs, you see. My wife, she does not allow it. Good woman. She watches over me. I used to drink… a little. Years ago. Now… maybe a small glass of wine sometimes with dinner. Very small. Nothing like before. Mostly, I just sit. Watch television. Not much to do anymore. Too tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Just the pills my wife gives me for my knees. Old lady pills, she calls them. Helps a little. And sometimes, when my stomach hurts bad, she gives me something for that too. White pills. I don’t know the names. She handles all that. I just take them. She knows best. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with a physical exam, Mr. Grumman. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. We need to get a better understanding of what's going on. Please lie down on the examination table.
