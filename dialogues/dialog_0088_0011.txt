DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so I’ll be quick. I need somethin’ signed. A… a paper. About gettin’ some work done. On my… face. It’s for a procedure. A cosmetic one. I don’t rightly remember all the details, but the people need it signed to… proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. Let's see… I have you here. And you said this is for a procedure on your face?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Look, I do a lot of tower work, you understand? Radio, cell towers… up high. And sometimes… things happen. It ain’t important what happens. Just need the paper signed so I can get back to work. Is that possible? Don't need a whole lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, to sign off on any procedure, even a cosmetic one, I really need to understand what’s being done, and why. It's for your safety, you see. "Things happen" doesn’t give me enough information. Could you tell me a little more about what happened, and what the procedure is supposed to address?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect… I ain't a doctor, I fix towers! And I don't recall specifics. Some scrapes, maybe? A little… damage. They offered to fix it, make it look… presentable. That's all I know. Some young fella showed me the paper, said it needed a doctor's sign-off. I figured… it was routine. I don't need a history lesson or a whole examination. Just the signature, please. I got jobs waitin'.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're eager to get back to work, but I can’t simply sign a form without knowing what it’s for. Even a seemingly minor procedure can have risks. Tower work sounds dangerous, and any injury to your face could have long-term consequences. Do you recall where this injury happened, or who provided the initial assessment?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, towers! All over the state, I work 'em. Small towns, big cities, doesn't matter. Some company sent a… a technician. Young man. That's all I remember. He looked official enough. Had a clipboard, a pen… the paper. Honestly, Doctor, I deal with volts and heights, not medical forms. I’m a practical man, I need somethin’ fixed, I get it fixed. This is gettin’ ridiculous. Is this somethin' you can do or not? I ain’t got time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you may have received care from an unverified source, and unfortunately, I still can't sign off on a procedure without knowing exactly what it involves. It's my professional responsibility to ensure your safety. Do you have the paper with you?
PATIENT: Here! Take it. Read it. I don’t know what all this mumbo jumbo says. Just sign it so I can go. And please, don't ask me any more questions about… voltages or heights. It’s irrelevant. Just… the signature. I’m payin’ for your time, ain't I?
DOCTOR: Let's see… “Facial dermal filler injection”… performed by… an individual with no listed medical license?
PATIENT: Look, I… I didn’t check. Like I said, I fix towers! I don’t go around askin’ fellas for their… certificates. He seemed professional enough. Offered a good price. I figured it was a quick fix. Is this… is this a problem? I just need my face lookin’ presentable, that’s all. Don't make a big deal out of nothin'. I ain't lookin' for trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, this is a problem. Receiving medical procedures from someone not properly licensed is extremely dangerous. You could have a serious infection, nerve damage, or other complications. We need to address this immediately. I cannot, and will not, sign this form. In fact, I strongly recommend we get you to an emergency room to be evaluated. Are you experiencing any pain, swelling, or redness on your face?
PATIENT: Look, I feel fine! A little… tight, maybe? But I ain't runnin' to no emergency room. It’s a little… puffiness, that’s all. And I ain't payin’ for a fancy hospital visit. I just want my face fixed. This is gettin’ ridiculous. You’re makin’ a mountain out of a molehill. I came here for a signature, not a lecture. I’m leavin’. You’ve wasted my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please, sit down. I understand your frustration, but your health is my priority. Ignoring this could have serious consequences. I’m not trying to waste your time, I'm trying to protect you. I can’t let you leave without ensuring you understand the risks and have access to proper medical care. I’m going to call for an ambulance. This is not something you can simply ignore.
PATIENT: No! No ambulance! Absolutely not. Look, I… I'll just go somewhere else. Somewhere they don't… interrogate people. I’m perfectly fine! A little puffiness, that’s all. You're overreacting! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're upset, but I am obligated to ensure your safety. You've received a medical procedure from an unlicensed provider, and you're exhibiting symptoms that require immediate evaluation. I cannot allow you to leave without seeking proper medical attention. I'm calling 911.
