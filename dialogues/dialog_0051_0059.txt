DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s about my speech, I suppose. It’s been… a bit off lately. Hard to explain, really. I just… stumble over my words sometimes, and it doesn't feel quite right. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bit off” and stumbling over words. And you said it's been happening without a clear start date… that’s alright, we'll try to figure things out. Can you describe what you mean by "doesn't feel quite right"?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s… like my tongue feels heavy, sometimes. And… it’s hard to think of the words before I say them, if that makes sense? Like there's a delay. Not a big one, but… noticeable. It’s frustrating, mostly. Especially at work, you know? I’m a construction manager, so I need to be clear with instructions.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heaviness in the tongue and a slight delay in word retrieval. That sounds concerning, and I understand how frustrating that would be in your line of work. Just to be thorough, has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… I think it comes and goes. It’s not always there. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… like today, it’s a bit worse. I haven't really kept track, to be honest. Work’s been busy. And… well, I just haven’t really thought much about it until it started bothering me more recently. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention now. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn’t seem to be worse after exercise, or when I’m stressed… I mean, work is stressful, but… it doesn’t feel directly connected. Sometimes I think it’s worse when I’m tired, maybe? But I’m often tired, so it’s hard to say. I’m really not sure, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Adyn. Don't worry about pinpointing an exact cause. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Have you noticed any changes in your voice – hoarseness, weakness, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. My voice feels… normal, I think. Maybe a little rough sometimes, but I just put that down to being tired, or talking a lot at work. My husband hasn't said anything about it, and he usually tells me if something sounds off. I haven’t noticed anything particularly different, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing, or any changes in your taste or smell?
PATIENT: No, not really. Swallowing is fine, and my taste and smell seem normal. I enjoy my food, thankfully! I haven’t noticed anything unusual there either. I made ackee and saltfish for my husband last week, and it smelled wonderful. So, no changes with that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, but they haven’t ever told me about anything serious. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. I’m married, and my husband's very healthy too. I don’t have any… chronic illnesses, if that’s what you mean. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I was a healthy baby, and I haven’t had any major accidents or injuries. I’ve been lucky, thankfully. I’ve never needed to be hospitalized, and I haven’t had any surgeries. I… I really haven’t had much to do with doctors, to be honest. Just the usual check-ups.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a bit hard, actually. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don’t really know much about her medical history. My father lives in Jamaica, and we don’t talk very often. I know he’s generally healthy, but… I don’t know about any specific illnesses that run in the family. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My husband's family is very healthy too, as far as I know. It’s just… I haven’t really thought about it much before now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Adyn. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy with a good diet and exercise, so I don’t really need any medication. I drink a lot of water, too. So, no, nothing regular. Just the occasional ibuprofen, if I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to a medication. I’ve never been stung by a bee or anything, either. So, no allergies, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, that's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Just to see if we can get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my speech, so yes, please go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Alright, everything sounds clear so far. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m just going to check your cranial nerves… I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I’ll check your facial movements. Okay, good. No obvious weakness or asymmetry there. I’m just going to check your tongue… could you stick it out for me, please?
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. Is that alright? It feels… normal, I think. I haven’t noticed anything different with it, but… Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It looks fine, Adyn, but I did notice a very slight tremor… it’s not necessarily anything to worry about, but I want to be thorough. Now, could you say “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers” for me, please?
PATIENT: “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.” Um… is that alright? I feel a bit silly saying that. It feels… harder than it should.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Adyn. And thank you for being so patient with me. I’m starting to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, there’s a possibility that this could be related to a neurological issue. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I think it would be best to order some imaging – an MRI of the brain – just to rule out any potential problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Is… is something seriously wrong, Doctor? What kind of problems are we ruling out? I’m… I’m a bit scared. I just want to know what's going on with my speech. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, please go ahead with the MRI, but… could you explain a bit more about why? What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried, Adyn, and I apologize if I’ve caused any alarm. An MRI is just an imaging test – it uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It’s painless and non-invasive. We’re looking to rule out a few things, such as a stroke, a tumor, or any inflammation that could be affecting your speech centers. It doesn't mean that’s what's happening, but it's always best to be thorough. It’s the best way to get a definitive answer. I’m going to order the MRI for tomorrow morning. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the appointment. I’ll also refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A neurologist… that sounds serious. But I understand you’re just being thorough. Tomorrow morning… okay. I’ll wait for the radiology department to call. So, an MRI and a neurologist appointment… Is there anything I should do or avoid before the MRI? And… will the neurologist be able to tell me what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. And you’re very smart to ask about preparation for the MRI. Please remove any jewelry, piercings, or anything metallic before the appointment. The radiology technician will give you specific instructions. They’ll also ask about any implanted devices you may have. As for the neurologist, they're the best equipped to diagnose the cause of your speech difficulties. They'll review the MRI results, perform a more detailed neurological examination, and discuss the best course of treatment with you. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your speech, weakness, numbness, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here is a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. And here is the information for the radiology department. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Dr. Eleanor Vance… okay. Thank you. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m still a bit scared, but… I feel better knowing what’s going on, and that you’re taking this seriously. Thank you for your time, and for listening to me. I’ll wait for the radiology department to call, and I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Vance. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here for you. And remember, we're taking this one step at a time. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. .
