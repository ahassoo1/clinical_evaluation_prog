DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve been feeling… weaker, I suppose. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Weakness and drooping eyelids – those are certainly things we want to investigate. Could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started, I think, in my arms. Just feeling… tired more easily when I was doing things around the house. I work in facilities management, so I’m quite active during the day – lifting things, checking equipment, that sort of thing. And it’s just become harder. Now it’s… it’s in my legs too. Not constantly, but after a while, they just feel like they won’t… hold me up as well. It’s not painful, just… tiring. And difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in your arms, gradually progressing to your legs, and it's a tiring weakness rather than pain. That's helpful information. And you mentioned this has been going on for a few months?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’d say… maybe six months now? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, because at first, I just thought I was a bit out of shape. I had a busy winter, and I didn't get to the gym as much as usual. But it hasn’t gotten better with more rest, and that’s what worried me enough to come in.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this weakness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Some days are much better than others. If I get a good night’s sleep, I might feel almost normal in the morning. But by the afternoon, it’s usually back. And sometimes, it’s worse on certain days for no apparent reason. It's… unpredictable, really. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific I’m doing.
DOCTOR: I see. Unpredictable weakness that fluctuates with rest. That's important to note. Now, let’s talk about those eyelids. You said they’re drooping. Is it both eyelids, or just one?
PATIENT: It’s both, Doctor. Not drastically, at first. But it’s definitely become more noticeable. People have started asking if I'm tired, even when I’ve slept well. It's… distracting. And it makes it harder to keep my eyes open for long periods. It’s not painful, just… heavy. And I find myself squinting a little more, I think. I’m not sure if that’s related, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyelids are affected, and it’s progressively worsening, causing you to squint. Let’s move on to a brief review of your other health. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, like double vision or blurred vision, besides the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. No, I don't think so. My vision feels… normal, if that makes sense. Perhaps a little strained sometimes, because of the squinting, but I haven’t noticed any double vision or things being blurry. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago, and everything was fine then. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn’t changed recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in vision besides possible strain from squinting. That's good to know. Have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I haven't had any trouble swallowing food or drinks, and my voice feels normal. I haven't noticed anyone telling me I sound different, or that I'm slurring my words or anything like that. It's just... the weakness and the eyelids, really. I was a little worried about that being something serious, but it's good to hear you ask about other things.
DOCTOR: Good. It's always best to rule things out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control?
PATIENT: No, no changes there either, Doctor. Everything is… regular, if you don't mind me saying so. I haven’t experienced any difficulties in that area. I apologize if these are personal questions, but I understand you need to ask. I'm just trying to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Mr. Schaust. These questions are important, and you’re very helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been fairly healthy, all my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, things like that. But I haven’t been diagnosed with anything serious. I've never been hospitalized, and I don’t take any regular medication. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. I had a divorce a few years back, which was stressful, but otherwise, I’ve been quite well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history, and you're not currently taking any medications. And no history of hospitalization. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Not even tonsils out or anything like that. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I always thought I’d need something eventually, but so far, so good. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but I just rested and drank plenty of fluids, and I recovered fine. It was just… a bad flu. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit tricky. My mother… she had some problems with arthritis in her later years, but that’s quite common, isn't it? And my father… he had high blood pressure, but he didn’t take much care of himself, to be honest. He smoked, and he didn’t eat very well. I don’t think either of them had anything… serious, like heart disease or cancer. I’m not really sure. My family isn’t very good at talking about these things, if you understand what I mean. It’s just… not discussed. I’m an only child, too, so there isn't anyone else to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of arthritis and high blood pressure, but not much else known due to lack of discussion within the family. Now, regarding your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never have. I find it… unpleasant, frankly. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I live a fairly quiet life, to be honest. I work, I try to stay active, and I enjoy reading. That’s about it. I'm not much of a social butterfly, if you know what I mean. The divorce… well, it made me re-evaluate some things. And I decided I prefer a simpler life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, are you currently employed, and if so, what do you do?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I work in facilities management. I’m responsible for the upkeep of a few commercial buildings – making sure everything is in working order, handling repairs, coordinating with contractors, things like that. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it, even though it can be physically demanding. It’s… it’s a bit worrying, actually, thinking about how difficult it’s becoming with this weakness. I’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to keep up with it. That's another reason I came in to see you, Doctor. I’m concerned about my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s good you’re addressing this now. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat most foods without any problems, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. I've always been quite careful about what I eat and what I take, to be honest. I’m not one for taking risks. So, no, no allergies that I’m aware of. I think that’s everything, Doctor. I hope I haven’t rambled on too much.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Schaust. You’ve been very thorough, and that’s incredibly helpful. Thank you. Alright, now I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I’m a little nervous, to be honest, but I’m trusting your expertise. I’d just like to get to the bottom of this, if possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam. I’ll also take a closer look at your eyelids and assess your muscle strength. It will take a few minutes. Your blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Those are all within normal limits. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities, except for some mild weakness noted in your proximal arm and leg muscles - a 4/5. We'll need to monitor that. Your cranial nerves appear intact. I also observed some ptosis – drooping of both eyelids – and your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. No nystagmus is noted.
PATIENT: A 4/5? What does that mean, exactly? Mild weakness… is that serious? And ptosis… is that just a fancy word for the drooping eyelids I’ve been noticing? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I’m rather anxious about this. I just… I need to understand what’s going on. And what happens next.
DOCTOR: You have every right to be anxious, Mr. Schaust, and I'm happy to explain everything as clearly as possible. A 5/5 strength means normal muscle strength – you can fully resist my force. A 4/5 means good strength, but with some difficulty resisting force. It’s considered mild weakness, and it's why I noted it in your proximal arm and leg muscles – those are the muscles closer to the center of your body. And yes, ptosis is the medical term for drooping eyelids. It's the finding I observed during the exam that correlates with what you've been describing. Now, based on your history and the physical exam findings – the fluctuating weakness, the ptosis, the mild muscle weakness – several possibilities come to mind. One possibility is Myasthenia Gravis, an autoimmune condition that affects the nerves and muscles, leading to weakness and fatigue. It often presents with fluctuating symptoms and ptosis. Another possibility, although less likely given your age and lack of other symptoms, is a neuromuscular disorder. To investigate further, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a test for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which can help diagnose Myasthenia Gravis. I’d also like to order an MRI of the brain and orbits to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? Autoimmune condition… that also sounds… concerning. I’ve never had anything like this before. I just… I’m worried. But yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then please, go ahead. Blood tests and an MRI… whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. I just want to know what I’m dealing with. And what can be done about it. I still need to be able to work, you see. And… well, I’d like to get my life back to normal. As normal as it can be, anyway. How long will it take to get the results back? And… will I need to see a specialist?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schaust. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainty, and I want to assure you that we're taking all necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed pictures of your brain and surrounding structures. It doesn’t involve radiation and is generally very safe. The blood tests and MRI will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. The blood test results usually come back within 5-7 business days, and the MRI results typically take a bit longer, around 3-5 business days. Given your symptoms and the potential for Myasthenia Gravis, I do believe a referral to a neurologist is warranted. A neurologist is a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders and will be best equipped to interpret the results and manage your care. I can send a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. She’s experienced in diagnosing and treating Myasthenia Gravis and other neuromuscular conditions. In the meantime, it's important to avoid strenuous activity and prioritize rest. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Would you like me to proceed with the referral to Dr. Vance and order the blood tests and MRI?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Yes, proceed with the referral and the tests. Everything. I want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience. You've explained everything very clearly, and… well, it makes me feel a little bit better, knowing that we're taking steps to find out what's going on. And thank you for recommending Dr. Vance. I’ll look forward to hearing from her office. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific symptoms I should be particularly aware of? Besides the breathing, swallowing, and speaking, of course. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Besides difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking, please be mindful of double vision or blurred vision, and any new or worsening muscle weakness. Also, pay attention to any changes in your facial expression or difficulty closing your eyes. It’s also important to keep a symptom diary, noting when your symptoms occur, how severe they are, and what activities seem to trigger or worsen them. This information will be very helpful for Dr. Vance. I’ll send the referral to Dr. Vance’s office and have them contact you to schedule an appointment. The lab order for the blood tests will be sent electronically to the lab nearest to you, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. I’ll also print out a summary of our conversation and the lab orders for you to take with you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your time, and your kindness. And… I'll keep the symptom diary, as you suggested. Thank you again. I’ll… I’ll wait to hear from Dr. Vance’s office. I think that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Vance. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, and I wish you all the best. .
