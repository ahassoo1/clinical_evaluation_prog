DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, Doctor… Vanochten, is it? Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a… a paper signed. Something about… fixin’ myself up a bit. Cosmetic… somethin’. A friend told me I needed clearance. Don't rightly remember the details. Just want it done quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you're looking for a form signed for… cosmetic procedures?
PATIENT: That’s right. A form. Yes. Look, I work with… antennas. And towers. Big ones. And little ones. Been doin’ it a long time. But, uh… this friend said I needed a doctor to say I’m… able. Before I… you know. Get things done. It's important for my… appearance. Now, can we just get to the signin'? I got appointments. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Okay. While I understand you're pressed for time, Mr. Honcoop, I do need to gather some basic information before signing any medical clearance form. It's a matter of ensuring your safety, and frankly, my professional responsibility. This isn't just a formality. What specifically are you hoping to have done?
PATIENT: Safety? Doctor, I climb these things! Tallest towers in the state. I am safety. Look, it's… a little tuck here, a little lift there. You know. Gettin’ rid of the… sag. Face is droopin’, friend said. Now, are you gonna ask a million questions, or are we doin’ this? Honestly, I don't see what it has to do with climbin’ towers. Completely different things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, even cosmetic procedures carry risks. Anesthesia, infection, scarring... These can all be affected by underlying health conditions. And believe it or not, even something seemingly unrelated like climbing towers could be relevant, depending on your overall health and stamina. Just a few quick questions, alright?
PATIENT: Stamina? Doctor, I told you, I climb! Every week. Rain or shine. And I ain’t had nothin’ stitched in fifty years. Look, I don't have conditions. I eat right, sleep okay, work hard. Simple as that. Anesthesia… just put me to sleep. I trust you know what you're doin’. Now, this form... is it long? I really need to be goin’. Got a schedule, you see. A very important schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I'll keep it brief. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now you’re talkin' crazy. Diagnosed with… what was that word? Look, I told you, I’m a hard worker. I don't sit around lettin' doctors poke and prod. Never been inside a hospital for nothin' serious. A broken arm once, fallin' off a ladder… but that was years ago. Climbin' towers, you know. It happens. Don't see how that matters for a little face work. This is gettin' ridiculous. Just sign the paper, Doctor. I ain’t got time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. No high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems, you said. And no recent hospitalizations. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… There was somethin’… a long time ago. When I was a boy. Appendicitis, maybe? Or was it tonsils? It was… a blur. Very young. Don’t remember much. Definitely nothin’ recently. Nothin’ that would stop me from… you know. Climbin’ a tower. Or gettin' a little work done. Honestly, all these questions are makin’ my head spin. Is this normal? I just need a signature!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. We've established a possible childhood surgery, but no recent medical issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I got work to do! I don’t sit around swallowin’ pills. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache. But that’s it! I don't believe in all that fancy medicine. Give me a good night’s sleep and a strong cup of coffee, and I’m good as new. Now, are you gonna keep askin' questions all day, or can we finally get to the signin’? I got antennas waitin’! Seriously, these things don't install themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no regular medications, just occasional aspirin. And you’ve had no prior medical diagnoses beyond a possible childhood surgery. Now, before I sign anything, I need to do a very quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… it will just take a few minutes. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Exam? Now you're makin’ me nervous! Doctor, I came here for a signature, not a physical! I don't have time for proddin' and pokin'! I climb towers, remember? I'm in better shape than half the doctors I meet. Look, I appreciate your… concern, but this is gettin’ ridiculous. Just sign the paper and let me go. I’m startin' to feel… lightheaded. Probably from all the questions. Seriously, I need to be goin’. Now. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience sign a medical clearance form without a basic assessment. It’s for your safety. Given your reluctance to allow a simple exam, and the lack of a clear medical history, I am unable to provide this clearance. I recommend you consult with another physician who can perform a thorough evaluation. Perhaps one specializing in occupational health?
