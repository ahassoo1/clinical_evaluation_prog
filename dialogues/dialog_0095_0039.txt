DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Vanochten. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Though, please, call me Lindsey. Mr. Bohnett feels awfully formal, don't you think? I got a letter from the clinic saying my cholesterol was a bit high… something about hyper… something? I don’t rightly recall the whole word, and truth be told, I don’t understand much about it. It's a little worrying, getting old, you know? Things just start… failing.
DOCTOR: Lindsey, absolutely. Hyperlipidemia – that’s the word you’re thinking of. It simply means you have higher than optimal cholesterol levels in your blood. It is common as we get older, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It doesn’t necessarily mean things are failing, it just means we need to take a look and see what’s going on. Let’s start with a little more detail. Do you remember when you had the blood test done, and did the letter mention any specific numbers for your cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... the blood test… It was just last month, I believe. July, yes, sometime in July. And numbers… Oh dear. Let me see if I kept the letter handy. Ah, here we go. Let’s see… total cholesterol… 240, it says. LDL was 160, and… HDL was 40. Those numbers don't mean much to me, but I suppose they mean something to you?
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers do tell us something. Okay, a total cholesterol of 240 is above the recommended level. The LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, at 160 is also high. And the HDL, the “good” cholesterol, at 40 is a little on the low side. Now, these numbers alone don’t give us the whole picture. We need to consider a few other things. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My mother… she had a weak heart, always complaining of palpitations. And my father… he had a stroke when he was about my age now. Didn't take care of himself, that one. Smoked like a chimney and ate nothing but fried foods. I always thought it was the smoking, mostly. Though, I suppose it could have been the cholesterol, too. My brother, Harold, he had high blood pressure, but I don't recall anything about his cholesterol specifically. Is that the kind of thing you need to know? I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Lindsey. Family history is important. Okay, so mother with heart problems, father with a stroke, and brother with high blood pressure. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that’s it. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn’t these days? I try to stay active, you know? Walk around the farm as much as I can. I used to be a carpenter, building furniture mostly, so I was always on my feet. Though, these old bones don’t hold up like they used to. Do you need to know about… old injuries? I broke my wrist when I was a boy, climbing a tree. That doesn’t seem relevant, does it?
DOCTOR: No, the broken wrist isn't something we need to worry about right now. Just trying to get a complete picture. So, no diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues, and gallbladder removed twenty years ago. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. Always tried to avoid them if I could. My wife, bless her soul, she was always taking something for this and that. But I always figured a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet were better than any pill. Though, I do take a little vitamin D in the winter. The days get so short up here, you know? And Doc Hansen used to recommend it for the bones. That’s about it, really. Is it bad that I don't take medications? Am I supposed to be taking something already?
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad at all that you don’t take medications. Many people prefer to manage things naturally, and that’s perfectly fine. We'll see what the best course of action is for you. Okay, last few questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched the stuff. My father did, of course, but I always swore I'd stay away from it. Smelled awful and made him cough something terrible. My wife, she didn’t approve of it either. She always said it was a waste of good money. No, never smoked a day in my life. And I barely drink, either. A glass of wine with dinner now and then, that’s all. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all. That’s very good to hear. Okay, one last thing. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've been stung by a bee or two, out on the farm, but nothing more than a little swelling. My wife was allergic to penicillin, I think. But I don't recall ever having any trouble with anything myself. Nope, can’t think of a single allergy. I'm a pretty lucky fella, all things considered. You can go ahead with that exam now, if you like.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lindsey. Let's do a quick check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs and heart. Then I'll take a look at your abdomen. It won't take long. If you could just sit up here for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. These old joints aren't as cooperative as they used to be. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Not overly concerning at this point, but worth noting. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. No enlargement of the liver or spleen. Alright, that was quick. Everything seems within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur, which we’ll keep an eye on. Now, I'd like to order a lipid panel to confirm those cholesterol numbers, and also a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking and prodding. A little blood work is fine, I suppose. Can’t hurt to be sure, can it? Just let me know if it’s going to cost a fortune. I’m retired, you know, and don’t have a lot of extra money lying around. And is that murmur… bad? Is it something I should be worrying about right away? I get a little anxious when I hear talk about murmurs. My wife… well, she had some heart trouble near the end.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lindsey. It's good you're asking questions. The murmur is likely innocent - many people have them, and they don't cause any problems. However, we’ll want to monitor it just to be safe. The blood work is fairly standard, and the cost shouldn’t be exorbitant. I’ll have the lab draw a small amount of blood – just a few vials. We can discuss payment options with the billing department if needed, and I'm happy to see if there are any programs to help with the cost. They can also give you an estimate beforehand. The lipid panel will give us a more accurate picture of your cholesterol levels, and the basic metabolic panel will check your overall kidney function and blood sugar. It's all just part of getting a complete picture, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Go ahead and order those tests. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a little, knowing what's going on. And thank you for offering to help with the cost. I appreciate that very much. I suppose I just need to go down to the lab and have them draw some blood, then? Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. You'll need to head down to the lab – they’re just down the hall to your left. And yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. It’s important for accurate results. Here’s the form. They’ll need this when you check in. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan, if needed. It might involve lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, or medication, if your cholesterol levels are significantly high. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Twelve hours fasting, no problem. I can manage that. And I'm happy to discuss lifestyle changes – I’ve always tried to eat healthy, but maybe I can do more. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with an old man like me. I guess I'll head down to the lab now. Is there anything else I should know before I go? Perhaps a reminder of what to tell them at the front desk?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. Just tell them you’re here for a lipid panel and basic metabolic panel, and give them this form. They’ll take care of the rest. And don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions down there. No, I don’t think there’s anything else for now. Just get some rest, stay hydrated, and we’ll see you back here when the results are available. Here’s my card with the clinic number, in case you need to reach me. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Feel free to take your time getting down to the lab, and don't hesitate to ask the nurses if you need help finding it.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your help and your reassurance. I’ll head down to the lab now, then. And I’ll be sure to call if I have any questions. Have a good day, Doctor Vanochten.
