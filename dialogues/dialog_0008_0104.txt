DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, honestly? My throat. It’s been… troublesome. I don’t have time for this, you understand. I work very hard. Just…hurts to swallow. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. “Troublesome” is a good start. Can you tell me a little more about that pain?
PATIENT: More? Honestly, Doctor, what is there to tell? It hurts. Like… sandpaper, maybe? Or when you have a cold, but it hasn’t quite gotten there yet. It’s just… irritating. I really don’t see what’s so complicated. Is this going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I just need to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a difficult question. A few days, I suppose. Maybe a week? It all feels rather… blurry. I was very busy at the plant, separating things, and then filtering… it was all a bit of a rush. I don't really keep track of these things. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be. A week is helpful to know. And you mentioned working at a plant… separating and filtering things. Anything specific you were working with that might be irritating your throat?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, really. I don’t know what you’re getting at. Just…plant things. Chemicals, dust… everything. It's a plant! Everything is irritating. We wear masks, of course. Though, sometimes they… don't fit properly. It’s not my job to ensure the equipment is perfect, you see. Is this relevant? Honestly, I have a very important shift later.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, the mask fit isn’t always ideal. Have you noticed any fever, cough, or runny nose along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? Runny nose? I… I haven’t checked. I don’t do temperatures. And a runny nose… probably not. I wouldn't notice, honestly. I'm too busy. I just know my throat feels awful. Is this… is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? I really don't have the patience for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever or runny nose that you’ve noticed. I'd like to take a quick look at your throat, just to see what we're dealing with. It won't be extensive, I promise. Just a quick examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. Fine. But make it quick. I have things to do. And please, be gentle. I don't want this to interfere with my shift. It’s already been a troublesome morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani. If you could just open wide and say "Ah". I'll just take a quick peek. Okay… tonsils are a little red and swollen. No visible exudate, though. Can you swallow normally?
PATIENT: Yes, I can swallow. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like something is scratchy. Not painful, exactly. Just… irritating. Look, is there anything serious going on here? I really can't afford to be sick. I have responsibilities. Is it just…a cold?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t appear to be a severe infection at this point, but it’s hard to say definitively without knowing more. Given your work environment and the irritation you’re experiencing, it could be a mild viral pharyngitis or some chemical irritation. Have you experienced any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Goodness, no. I work hard, Doctor, but I’m not weak. I breathe normally. Perhaps a little dusty sometimes, but that's just the plant. Look, can you just give me something for it? A pill, a syrup… anything to make it stop being irritating? I really can't deal with a drawn-out investigation. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your description and the lack of any concerning symptoms like fever or difficulty breathing, I can recommend a symptomatic treatment. I’m going to suggest a course of warm salt water gargles several times a day, over-the-counter throat lozenges, and plenty of fluids. I'll also write a prescription for a mild anesthetic throat spray to help with the irritation. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't take much in the way of medicine. I'm a strong Tongan woman, Doctor. I don’t get allergies. Though... my late husband, he was allergic to something. Bees, I think. But that was him. Look, just write the prescription. And make sure it doesn’t interfere with my work. I really need to be focused.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Here's the prescription for the throat spray. It shouldn't cause any drowsiness or interfere with your ability to work. It's important to stay hydrated and rest when you can, even if it's just a little. And if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, have trouble breathing, or experience significant difficulty swallowing – please seek medical attention immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I understand. Fever, breathing… fine. Look, is that all? I really must be going. I have a shift to prepare for. And honestly, Doctor, I think I’ve wasted enough time here already. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Get well soon. Follow-up as needed. Patient reluctant to pursue further investigation. .
