DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think it's… bariatric surgery? My wife helped me set up the appointment. I don’t really remember all the details, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bariatric surgery is a good option for some people. It's helpful you came in to discuss it. And it's perfectly alright that you don’t recall all the details – that’s what I’m here for. Let me just take a look at your chart here… I see your wife set up the appointment and indicated you’re interested in exploring weight loss surgery options. First, could you tell me a little bit about your weight journey?
PATIENT: My weight journey… wow, that’s a big question. I guess it’s been… a long one. I’ve always been… bigger, I think. But it really started to become a problem a few years ago. After… well, after things got tough back home. It just… went up from there. I try to eat okay, but… it’s hard. And honestly, I don’t remember much about when it all started, just that it did. It feels like it's always been this way.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a while, and it's completely understandable that it feels overwhelming. It’s also common for life events, particularly stressful ones, to impact weight. You mentioned things getting tough back home - would you be comfortable sharing a little more about that, if you're willing?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s Iraq. I came here a few years ago. Things weren’t safe, you know? It’s… complicated. A lot happened. I don’t like to talk about it, if that’s okay. It just… makes me feel anxious. It's… hard to explain. I just wanted to get away, and start over. And I did, but… this weight, it feels like a part of that old life followed me. Does that make sense? I don't really remember the details, just the feeling.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kochubey. Trauma can have a very profound impact on our bodies and our health, and it’s perfectly alright that you don’t want to delve into details you’re not comfortable sharing. It’s very brave of you to share as much as you have. So, focusing on now, what are your biggest concerns regarding your weight?
PATIENT: Everything, really. I get tired really easily. Walking up the stairs is hard. I can’t play with my grandkids like I want to. And… my wife worries. She worries a lot. And I worry about her worrying. I also… I get short of breath sometimes. Just doing simple things. It’s… embarrassing. And I feel like I'm not around for my family as much as I should be. I just want to be… healthier. And able to do things. And I want my wife to stop worrying so much.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like your weight is significantly impacting your quality of life, both physically and emotionally, and it's wonderful that you're prioritizing your health for yourself and your family. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. I don’t really… see doctors much. Not when I was back home, and not really here either. I think… I had the usual childhood stuff? Chickenpox, maybe? Nothing serious. I don’t remember any big illnesses. And I don’t take any medications regularly. I had a bad back for a while, but it's gotten better on its own. I think that’s it. Honestly, I’m not very good with remembering things like that. My wife usually takes care of all of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can work with that. It sounds like you haven't had any major medical issues in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Apart from the bad back, I haven't really needed to see a doctor. I try to avoid them if I can, to be honest. It always feels like bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand that feeling. It's good to know you haven't had any prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we didn’t really talk about those things much. When I was growing up, you just… dealt with things. You didn't ask questions. But I think… my father, he had problems with his heart. I don’t know exactly what, just that he got sick. And maybe… my mother, she had some kind of trouble with her sugar? I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and I was young. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like there may be a family history of heart issues and potentially diabetes, but it’s understandable that the details are unclear. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, and I don’t use any tobacco. Never have. My wife doesn’t like it, and I don’t want to risk my health. It’s a bad habit, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. That’s a very healthy choice. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink… sometimes. Not a lot. Maybe a beer with dinner on the weekends. Or a glass of wine on special occasions. Nothing regular. My wife and I don’t really drink much. It’s not really a habit for us.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Just occasional, moderate use. Now, could you describe a typical day for me – what do you do, what’s your activity level like?
PATIENT: Well, I work in retail. Mostly just standing behind the counter, helping customers. It’s not very active, to be honest. A lot of standing, but not much moving around. I get home, have dinner with my wife. We watch TV sometimes. I try to help her with the housework, but I get tired easily. On the weekends, I sometimes visit my grandkids. I try to play with them, but I can’t keep up for very long. I mostly just sit and watch them play. It’s… not very active, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like your job is fairly sedentary, and you experience fatigue which limits your activity. That's helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you might have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I don’t have any known allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks the labels when she buys food, just in case, but I’ve never had a problem. I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Kochubey, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will just involve checking your blood pressure, heart rate, listening to your lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It’s a standard part of the evaluation process. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as I go, and it shouldn't be painful at all. Okay, I’m just going to take your blood pressure now. Please relax your arm… Good. Your blood pressure is 150/90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your weight and activity level. Your heart rate is 80, regular. I’m listening to your lungs now… Breath sounds are a little diminished, but clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. It's soft, but I can feel some fullness. No tenderness… Everything seems okay here. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Overall, your exam findings are consistent with your weight and lifestyle. Your blood pressure is a little high, which is something we’ll want to monitor. I’m going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. This will help me determine if there are any other underlying health issues we need to address. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. When will I get the results? And what happens next? I’m a little worried, if I’m being honest. Is surgery still a good idea, even with the high blood pressure?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be worried, Mr. Kochubey. I understand. The blood work should take about a week to come back. My office will call you as soon as the results are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Regarding the surgery, the high blood pressure is something we need to address before considering it. We’ll start with lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – and if that's not enough, we may need to consider medication. It's important to be in the best possible health before undergoing any surgical procedure. It doesn’t necessarily mean surgery is off the table, but we need to optimize your health first. We'll also consult with a cardiologist to assess your heart health further. I want to ensure you’re a safe candidate for surgery. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. I’m glad you said that. I don’t want to rush into anything. Just want to be healthier, you know? And I don’t want to worry my wife even more. So… diet and exercise? What kind of diet? And what kind of exercise? I get tired really easily, like I said.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll start slowly and work together. For diet, I’ll have my nurse give you a referral to a registered dietitian. They can help you create a personalized meal plan that’s healthy, sustainable, and takes your preferences into account. The focus will be on whole, unprocessed foods – fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains – and reducing sugar, saturated fats, and processed foods. As for exercise, we'll start with something gentle, like walking for 30 minutes most days of the week. We can gradually increase the intensity and duration as you get stronger. Even small changes can make a big difference. We’ll also discuss strategies for managing your fatigue. Getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and pacing yourself are all important. I’m going to write down the names of the registered dietitian and a cardiologist I recommend. I’ll also give you a handout with information on healthy eating and exercise. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… manageable. Walking, and talking to someone about food. Okay. What about… after the blood work? What if something is wrong? What if it’s serious? I don’t want to scare my wife. She’s already worried enough.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good you’re thinking about that. If the blood work shows something is wrong, we’ll discuss the findings with you in detail, and explain all of your options. We’ll work together to create a treatment plan that’s right for you. And please know that I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. We'll address any concerns you have, and I will explain everything in a way you understand. It’s important to remember that finding something is not necessarily a bad thing. It just means we can address it and get you on the path to better health. And if it's something more serious, we'll work with specialists to ensure you receive the best possible care. We’ll keep your wife informed, of course, but we’ll do so in a way that’s supportive and reassuring. We can even involve her in the appointments if you’d like. For now, let's focus on the blood work and getting you connected with the dietitian. We’ll take things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, one step at a time. That sounds… good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And for not making me feel like I'm… a mess. Okay. So, the blood work, and the dietitian. What happens next after I get the referral? Do I just call them?
DOCTOR: You’re not a mess at all, Mr. Kochubey. It takes courage to come in and address these concerns, and I'm happy to help. Yes, after I give you the referral information, you'll just need to call their office and schedule an appointment. My nurse will also fax over your medical records to them, so they'll have all the necessary information when you arrive. Here you are. This sheet has the contact information for both. The dietitian is Sarah Chen, and her number is 555-123-4567. The cardiologist is Dr. David Lee, and his number is 555-987-6543. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Sarah Chen… and Dr. Lee. I'll write those down. Thank you, Doctor Petrimoulx. I really appreciate your help. I feel… a little less worried now. I guess… I'll see you in a week, after the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right, we’ll see you in about a week after the blood work results are available. My nurse will call you to schedule an appointment as soon as they have them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and have a good week. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. .
