DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh… the lady on the phone said I need to… learn some things? About… stuff. I don't really remember why. My husband, he made the appointment. He says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Right. “Learn some things.” Well, that’s… helpful. Your husband scheduled this appointment, you say. And he feels you… worry excessively?
PATIENT: Yes. He does. I… I guess I do. It’s just… things happen, you know? And then… then other things happen. I try to be careful, but… <shrugs> it doesn’t always work. And I don't have good memory these days.
DOCTOR: “Things happen.” Yes, well, life is full of unpleasantness. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? <frowns> I… I work with metal. Sheet metal. It’s… noisy. And sharp. Sometimes things fall. And… and I lift heavy things. Is that… specific enough? My back aches sometimes, but I take pills. A lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Sheet metal work. Right. And you're experiencing back pain, self-treating with… "a lot of pills." Do you know what kind of pills you're taking, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: <shakes head> No. My husband gets them. He says they help. Little white ones, mostly. Sometimes blue. I just… take them when it hurts. I don't ask. He gets mad if I ask too many questions. It’s easier to just… take the pills.
DOCTOR: Easier, perhaps. But not necessarily better. It's concerning that you don't know what you're taking, and even more concerning that your husband discourages you from inquiring. We need to establish a proper medication list. Do you have any idea what these pills might be for?
PATIENT: <sighs> For the pain! Like I said. My back, my hands… sometimes my head hurts too. He says it's stress. I don't know. He works long hours, and I… I just try to keep the house clean and take the pills. I really don't remember what the doctor said last time. It was a long time ago. <fidgets with her hands>
DOCTOR: Let’s see… according to the records, you haven't been seen in… nearly five years. And the notes are remarkably vague. “Vague” is being generous, actually. Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. We need to do a full review of systems. Let’s start with your back pain. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: <grimaces> Oh. It’s… dull. Mostly. But sometimes it’s sharp, like a… a little knife. And it goes down my leg. It’s worse when I bend over, or when I lift anything. Even groceries. It's just… always there, you know? A little bit. And then sometimes it's a lot. It makes me tired. Really tired. <rubs her lower back>
DOCTOR: Dull, with sharp exacerbations radiating down the leg, worse with bending and lifting. Constant baseline pain with acute flares. Fatigue associated with exacerbations. And when you say “a lot,” what does that actually mean?
PATIENT: <frowns> It means… I can't move. I have to lie down. And… and I get angry. I yell at my husband. He doesn’t like that. <looks down at her hands> It just… hurts so much. Like someone is… crushing my bones. Then I take more pills. Is that… helpful? <looks up with a pleading expression>
DOCTOR: “Crushing” pain requiring increased medication dosage… No, Ms. Fontanazza, that is not “helpful.” That indicates a worsening condition and potentially a dangerous dependence. We need to get a clear picture of what’s going on. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: <hesitates> Stand up? Oh. <grimaces> I don't know… it hurts just sitting. And… he doesn't like it when I move too much. He says I'll make it worse. But… <slowly begins to rise, wincing> Okay. Okay, I'll try. But be gentle, please. <stands with difficulty, leaning slightly to one side>
DOCTOR: Slowly, slowly. That’s fine. Let's have you lie down on your back on the table. We'll start with a neurological assessment. I need you to tell me if you feel any tingling or numbness in your legs or feet. And I’ll need you to cooperate fully, even if it's uncomfortable. I'm going to check your reflexes and your muscle strength.
PATIENT: <lies down gingerly, clutching her back> Okay. Tingling… sometimes. In my toes. And… and my left leg feels… heavy. Like it's not really mine. But mostly it just hurts. Please be quick, okay? This is… this is making me nervous. He gets very upset when I go to the doctor. He says they just want to give me more pills. <closes her eyes tightly>
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are diminished on the left side. Muscle strength… noticeably weaker in the left leg as well. And there's some tenderness along the spine… quite a bit of tenderness, actually. <palpates spine carefully> Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: <winces sharply, gasping> Ouch! Yes! Right there! It feels like… like someone is stabbing me. Please stop! Please! That really hurts. I… I don’t understand what you're doing. Just tell me if everything is okay! Is my back broken? <starts to tear up> He said I just pulled a muscle. <clutches her abdomen protectively>
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I've stopped. No, Ms. Fontanazza, I don't believe your back is “broken,” but it is clear we need further investigation. Your symptoms, combined with the findings of this examination, suggest a possible nerve compression issue. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. But before we proceed, I need a complete list of every medication you're taking. And I need you to be honest with me. Your husband’s opinions are not relevant at this time. This is about your health.
PATIENT: <sniffles> MRI… that’s expensive, isn’t it? He’ll be mad. And… and the pills… I don't know all the names. Just little white ones, mostly. Sometimes blue. And… and some yellow ones too, when my head hurts. He keeps them in a box in the closet. I… I'm scared. What if it's something bad? <starts to cry softly> He says I worry too much. <covers her face with her hands>
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your fear. And yes, an MRI can be expensive. We can discuss payment options and assistance programs. The important thing is to get a diagnosis so we can start treatment. As for the pills… we need to identify them. If you can’t recall the names, we’ll need to contact your husband. I understand you’re afraid of his reaction, but this is critical. Without knowing what you're taking, we can’t safely manage your pain or address potential interactions. I'm also concerned about potential opioid dependency given the frequency of your use. We will also discuss a referral to a pain specialist and potentially a mental health professional to help you cope with your anxiety and manage your fears. But first, let's focus on getting a clear understanding of what’s going on with your back. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: <wipes tears away with the back of her hand> Allergies… I don’t think so. Maybe… dust? Sometimes I sneeze. But not a lot. And… and I get hives when I eat shellfish, but I haven’t had that in years. He doesn’t like me eating shellfish. Says it makes me sick. <hesitates> He… he controls a lot of things. <looks down at her hands, fidgeting> I just want the pain to stop. Can you just… give me something for the pain right now? Please? I can't… I can't think straight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shellfish allergy noted. I understand your distress and your desire for immediate relief. However, I am hesitant to prescribe anything without a clear understanding of your medication history and a thorough diagnosis. We cannot simply mask the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. I can offer a non-opioid pain reliever – ibuprofen – to manage the discomfort in the short term. But this is not a long-term solution. I'm also going to order some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential issues. <pauses> Ms. Fontanazza, I’m also concerned about the level of control your husband appears to have over your healthcare decisions. I want you to know that you have the right to make your own choices about your health, and I am here to support you. Before we proceed, I need to ask some questions about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: <looks away, avoids eye contact> Alcohol… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner. He likes it too. Smoking… no. Never have. Recreational drugs… what does that mean? He wouldn’t like that. He says it’s a waste of money. <fidgets nervously> I just want to go home. This is… overwhelming. <starts to cry again, quietly> I just want the pain to stop. Can we just… order the MRI and get it over with? Please? I don’t want to talk about… this anymore. <covers her face with her hands>
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand this is overwhelming, and I apologize if my questions are upsetting you. I'm asking these questions because they're important for your overall health and to ensure I can provide you with the best possible care. "Recreational drugs" refers to substances like marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit drugs. I assure you, I'm not here to judge you, simply to gather information. <pauses> Let’s focus on the MRI for now. I’m going to write the order. It will require a referral to a local imaging center, and you'll need to schedule an appointment. They will likely ask for insurance information, but we can discuss options if you are uninsured. <begins typing on the computer> Once the MRI is completed, we'll review the results and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe the ibuprofen for pain relief. <pauses> I also want to reiterate my concern about your husband’s control over your healthcare decisions. If you feel unsafe or pressured by him, please let me know. We can connect you with resources that can help. <finishes typing> Here is the prescription for the ibuprofen and the MRI referral form. Do you have any questions about these forms?
PATIENT: <takes the forms hesitantly, looking down at them with a confused expression> Questions… I don’t know. It’s… a lot of paper. He usually fills these out. I… I just want to go home. He’s probably waiting for me. <looks up with pleading eyes> Can I just… go now? I promise I’ll schedule the MRI. I will. Just… please? I feel dizzy. <starts to stand up slowly, clutching her back> I think I need to lie down. <looks very distressed> I just want this to be over. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza, let’s get you settled. You appear quite distressed. We are not going to let you leave until we ensure you're stable and have a plan for getting home safely. I'm going to call a nurse to monitor your vitals and help you arrange transportation. It’s important that you don't drive in your current state. <calls out for a nurse> And please, don't worry. We'll get through this together. <offers a reassuring smile, but maintains a watchful eye on Airam> .
