DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah… yes. Good day. My wife… she want… baby. We… old now. She think maybe… need help? I not so sure… long time since last baby. Many years. I make little things with metal… and plastic. Not babies!
DOCTOR: Right. So, your wife is hoping to get pregnant?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that is right. She very hopeful. I… I want baby too, of course! But… is okay if not. We have good life. But she… she feels something missing. I try to remember… what doctor say before… many years ago… about… making baby. But… my mind… not so good now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me see if I can find anything in your chart. It has been a while. Do you recall approximately when you and your wife last had a child?
PATIENT: Hmm… very long time. Maybe… twenty years? Or more? I make little boats then… many, many boats. Sold them at market. My wife… she remember better than me. She good with dates. I forget everything. I think… maybe 1995? Or 1998? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has your wife had any children since then?
PATIENT: No… no children after that. Just… the one. A good boy. He… he grown up now. Lives far away. Very busy. We do not see him often. My wife… she worry she too old. That is why we come.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, getting pregnant at any age can be… complicated. We’ll need to do some testing to see if this is a viable option, and to make sure you’re both healthy enough. First, let’s talk about your wife’s medical history. Does she have any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… what does that mean? Like… always sick? She… she sometimes have trouble with her knees. Old age, you know? And… she takes a pill for her water pressure. The doctor give it to her last year. Not much else. She strong woman. Always working. But… she get tired easy now. Is that… is that what you mean? Chronic?
DOCTOR: Yes, chronic means something that lasts a long time, like ongoing. Okay, so knee trouble and high blood pressure. That's good to know. And what about you, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Me? Not much trouble. I make things. Metal, plastic. Keep my hands busy. Sometimes my back ache… from bending over. But… I not sick. I take a little pill for… for my heart. A long time ago, doctor say my heart was not strong. But I feel okay now. Mostly. I not good at remembering doctors… or pills.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do either of you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. My wife… she sometimes get a rash when she eat shrimp. But… that is just a little itch. Not serious. Me? I don't think so. Never had trouble with any pills. Maybe… a little upset stomach sometimes? But that could be from anything. Old food, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, before we proceed any further, I need to be frank. Getting pregnant at your ages carries significant risks. We'll need to do a thorough evaluation of both of you to determine if it's even safe to try. That includes blood work, a physical exam, and potentially some imaging. Are you both willing to undergo that process?
PATIENT: Risks…? What kind of risks? My wife… she very delicate. I don’t want to… to hurt her. Is it… dangerous? Maybe… maybe we just forget about baby. I not want to cause trouble. But she… she want this so much. If doctor say… if doctor say it is safe… then we do it. But not if it dangerous for her.
DOCTOR: Well, there are risks for both of you. For your wife, there's an increased risk of complications during pregnancy, like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and miscarriage. There's also a higher chance of complications during delivery. For you, there’s a slightly higher risk of cardiovascular events. We’ll need to assess your heart health very carefully. It's not a simple undertaking, Mr. Carlotta. And frankly, the chances of success are… low.
PATIENT: Low…? I see… My wife… she will be sad. She talk about this for months. But… I don’t want to put her in danger. Not for anything. Maybe… maybe we just talk about it. With her. And… and then decide. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… reasonable. Before you do that, though, I'd still like to do a basic physical exam on both of you, just to get a baseline. It won't be extensive, but it will give me a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A little… check-up? Yes. Yes, that is okay. Just… not too much poking. My wife… she not like being poked. And… I not so strong anymore. A quick look… yes. That is fine. We trust you, doctor. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with you, Mr. Carlotta. If you could just follow me over to the examination table… We’ll start with your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay… Blood pressure… yes. Heart… lungs. Is it… is it going to hurt? I not good with needles.
DOCTOR: No needles yet, Mr. Carlotta. Just listening. Now, if you could just sit here and relax… 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let's listen to your heart... Hmm. A slight murmur. Have you been told about this before?
PATIENT: Murmur…? I think… yes. A long time ago. Different doctor. He said… not to worry too much. Just… old age. Something about… valve? I not remember. It never bother me. I make boats… and things. Never stop me. Is it bad? Is that why you asking?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Carlotta, but it does warrant further investigation. We'll need to do an EKG to get a better picture of your heart's electrical activity. And we’ll schedule a follow-up with a cardiologist. Now, let's check your lungs. Take a deep breath…
PATIENT: Cardio… what now? More doctors…? I just want to know… is my wife… is she going to be okay? If we try for baby? That is all I care about. I not worry about my heart… if she is happy.
DOCTOR: A cardiologist is a heart specialist, Mr. Carlotta. We need to make sure your heart is strong enough to handle the stress of a potential pregnancy. Lungs are clear. Okay. Now, if you could just stand up, I want to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes…? Oh! Is everything okay? I not feel so good… a little dizzy. Maybe… maybe I sit down.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is still elevated. You're feeling dizzy?
PATIENT: Yes… a little… swimmy. And… my chest feels tight. Like… a heavy weight. I not like this feeling. Maybe… maybe we should stop. For today. I just want to go home… and see my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Let’s take a moment. I'm going to call for a nurse. Just sit here and try to relax. Nurse, we have a patient here, Manuel Carlotta, experiencing some chest tightness and dizziness. Blood pressure is 140/90. Can you come in immediately?
PATIENT: Thank you… My wife… she will be worried. Just… please… make sure she is okay. That is all I ask.
