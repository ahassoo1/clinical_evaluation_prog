DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And… my family. There’s a bit of a history, you see. It’s hard to explain exactly what’s happening, to be honest. It comes and goes, this… feeling. I just want to get it sorted if I can.
DOCTOR: “Acting up,” you say. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… right. Hmm. Well, sometimes I just… can’t hear properly. Like everything’s muffled. And then… oh dear, it’s hard to describe. The room spins. Not always at the same time, though. Sometimes just the hearing goes. Other times… everything goes dizzy. It doesn’t last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe an hour. But it’s… unsettling. And my husband… he used to get it too, before… well, before he passed. That’s why I’m a bit worried.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. It comes and goes, you see? It’s not… constant. I think… maybe a few years now? On and off. It started when… well, after my husband passed, I think. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. I was very upset then, so I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first. Just thought it was… stress, maybe. But it keeps happening, so… here I am. It's hard to say exactly how long, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said your husband experienced similar symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, he did. It was… the dizziness, mostly. He didn’t… couldn’t always hear properly either, sometimes. He went to a doctor about it, years ago. I don't remember what they said, though. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very involved in his appointments, to be honest. He was a strong man, always took care of things himself. It was just… similar, that’s all. The spinning, and the muffled hearing. It scared me when it started happening to me, I’ll tell you that. It brought back a lot of bad memories.
DOCTOR: And has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggered… hmm. No, not that I’ve noticed. It just… happens. Sometimes I'm busy, sometimes I'm resting. Sometimes it's a quiet day, sometimes it’s noisy. I haven’t been able to figure out what causes it. Maybe it's just my age? I don’t know. I really wish I could tell you something specific, Doctor, but I just can’t. It’s very frustrating. I’ve tried to think about it, really I have, but it just… happens without warning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some other questions then. Do you experience any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Oh, yes! Sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It's a… high-pitched sort of sound. Like a whistle, almost. It comes and goes, just like everything else. It's usually when I'm trying to sleep, I think. Makes it hard to get a good night’s rest, that’s for sure. It’s not constant, thankfully, but it’s definitely there sometimes. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It could be. And do you have any nausea or vomiting when you experience these episodes of dizziness and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that you mention it… yes. Sometimes. Not every time, but… sometimes I feel quite sick to my stomach. And… yes, I’ve been sick a couple of times, when it’s really bad. It doesn't last long, just… a little bit of vomiting. And then it’s gone, just like everything else! I hadn’t really thought about it until now, to be honest. It just… happens all at once, sometimes. The dizziness, the ringing, the muffled hearing… and then the sickness. It’s not pleasant, I can tell you that. I'm really starting to feel like I’m rambling, aren’t I? I apologize. It's just… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Mayhugh. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to take a look in your ears. Can you follow my gaze?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’m happy to cooperate. My ears… I do hope you can find something. I just want to get to the bottom of this, if you can. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds okay there. Now, let's take a look in your ears. Hmm. Your ear canal appears clear, but your tympanic membrane – that’s your eardrum – appears slightly retracted and a bit dull. Similar findings on this side. A slightly retracted and dull tympanic membrane. No visible signs of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Can you please stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'm a bit wobbly, I'm afraid. This balance thing isn’t my strong suit. I haven’t always been this clumsy, you know? My husband used to say I was as steady as a rock. Is this what you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is what I want you to do. Just try to stand still for a moment. Alright. Please sit down now. Okay, Mrs. Mayhugh. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called Ménière’s disease. It's an inner ear disorder that can cause episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus – that's the ringing you've been experiencing – and a feeling of fullness in the ear. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we will need to order some further testing. Would you be willing to undergo a hearing test – an audiogram – and possibly an MRI of your brain to rule out other causes?
PATIENT: Ménière’s disease… That sounds… complicated. And a bit frightening, to be honest. So that’s what this could be? All this spinning and the muffled hearing… It’s nice to finally have a possible explanation, even if it’s a complicated one. An MRI? Oh dear… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… scary? And a hearing test… that sounds alright, I suppose. If it will help figure things out, then yes, I’m willing. I just… I want to get to the bottom of this, if you can. Whatever it takes. But… tell me about the MRI. Is it painful? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Mayhugh. Let’s take it one step at a time. The MRI itself is not painful. You will lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a bit noisy – you will hear a knocking and whirring sound – so we will provide you with earplugs. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes, and you'll need to remain very still during the scan. The main thing is that it’s very important to tell the technician if you have any metal implants in your body – like pacemakers or surgical clips – as the magnet can be dangerous in those cases. Do you have any metal implants?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Metal implants. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago, and I don't recall any metal being used. And… no, nothing else. I had a little operation on my knee a few years back, but the doctor said they didn’t use any metal. Just… stitches. I’m pretty sure. It was a very small operation, just to clean up some cartilage. Honestly, I have a terrible memory, Doctor, as you know. I hope I’m not forgetting something important! Is there any way to be certain?
DOCTOR: Alright. We will have you fill out a detailed questionnaire before the scan to ensure your safety. It will ask about any metal implants, surgeries, and medical devices you may have. The technician will also review your medical history thoroughly before proceeding. In the meantime, let's schedule the audiogram. That's the hearing test. It's a simple, non-invasive procedure that will measure your hearing sensitivity at different frequencies. We can do that here in the clinic next week. Would Tuesday afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… yes, that should be alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a bit of a commitment that evening, but I can rearrange things if needed. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. So much to think about. But… if it will help figure out what’s going on, then I’m willing to do whatever it takes. So, Tuesday afternoon it is. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mrs. Mayhugh. We'll get you scheduled for the audiogram, and then we can discuss the results and plan further treatment once we have all the information. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that trigger your dizziness, and if you experience any severe vertigo, please go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Severe vertigo… alright, I’ll remember that. No, I don’t think so. Not right now, anyway. I’m sure I’ll think of something later. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. I just… I’m glad to finally have some answers, even if they’re not definite yet. It’s nice to know we’re taking steps to figure things out. I suppose that’s everything, then? I should probably be going. Thank you again, Doctor Kur. You have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Mayhugh. You have a good day as well. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you next Tuesday for the hearing test. .
