DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom is fine, don't need the "Mr." formalities. Look, it's… well, it's my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to bother a fella. And I don't bother with things that aren't important.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate, even if it wasn't a large amount. It’s good you’re addressing it. Can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint a picture? It was… red. Like blood usually is, I suppose. Not bright red, not dark… somewhere in between. And it wasn’t mixed in so much as… on top, you understand? Like a streak. I haven't been eating beets or anything, so it wasn't that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “On top” is helpful information. And you haven't consumed anything that could alter the stool color, like beets, red dye, or certain medications?
PATIENT: No. I told you, no beets. And I don't go for all that fancy colored food anyway. Makes a man question what he’s actually eating. As for medications… just a little something for my knees, but it's just a cream I rub on. Nothing I swallow. Honestly, doctor, I eat pretty plain. Meat and potatoes, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just pull up your records here... I see you’ve been seen at the clinic before, primarily for osteoarthritis in the knees. And no listed allergies. You mentioned a cream for your knees – what is the name of that cream?
PATIENT: Oh, good, someone bothered to write things down. It's… let me think. It's a white tube. Says… Voltarol. That’s it. Voltarol. Been using it for years, keeps the joints from locking up completely. Doesn't do much for the pain, but… well, better than nothing.
DOCTOR: Voltarol, a topical NSAID. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What does that even mean? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go. It's not a complicated process. Not more frequent, not less. Just… this blood thing. And it’s unsettling, you know? A man shouldn't see blood where blood shouldn’t be.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom. “Bowel habits” simply refers to how often you have a bowel movement, and the consistency of the stool. You said not more or less frequent, so that's good. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? No. Not particularly. My stomach grumbles sometimes, like any normal person's does. And maybe a little discomfort after a big meal, but I don't go around complaining about that. I'm 88 years old, doctor, things are going to ache a bit. I'm not a young pup anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course. And you haven't noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now there’s a question. I suppose I haven't been eating as much meat lately. It’s expensive, you know? And the arthritis makes it harder to get around to the store. But I wouldn't say I've lost weight, just… not gaining any. And who needs to gain weight at my age?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a rectal exam. This will help me assess the situation further. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Now hold on a minute. You want to… check? At my age? Look, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had doctors poke and prod enough already. I don’t see what good that’ll do. It's… undignified. Frankly, I don’t think it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your discomfort. However, given the presence of blood in your stool, a rectal exam is a standard part of the evaluation process. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, or masses. While it may be uncomfortable, it’s a crucial step in determining the cause of the bleeding and ensuring we don’t miss anything serious. We can discuss alternatives, but I strongly recommend it for a thorough assessment. It’s a matter of being cautious and rule things out, especially given your age. Is there anything specific about the exam that concerns you?
PATIENT: Cautious? Rule things out? Look, I'm not a fragile piece of glass. I've survived a lot. And frankly, I don't appreciate being talked down to. I’ve lived a long life, and I know my own body. It's probably just a bit of irritation, something minor. I’ve had worse. But… if you insist… I suppose. But I want it done quickly. And gently. And I want to know exactly what you're looking for before you start poking around.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will explain everything as I go, and proceed as quickly and gently as possible. I’m looking for any signs of inflammation, hemorrhoids, fissures, or masses. It will involve a gloved, lubricated finger briefly inserted into the rectum. It may cause some discomfort, but should not be overly painful. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No. Just… get on with it. The sooner it's over, the better. And try not to take all day. I haven’t got all afternoon.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will let you know when I'm finished. Alright. I palpated the rectum and did not feel any obvious masses. There is some mild tenderness, and I noted a small internal hemorrhoid. It appears to be a minor one, likely the source of the bleeding. I also note some anal fissures, which could also be contributing. However, to be certain and rule out any other underlying cause, I would like to order a fecal occult blood test to check for blood in the stool. And I recommend a colonoscopy. We need to see what is going on inside to be absolutely sure.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you're talking about sticking a camera where the sun don’t shine? Absolutely not. I've heard stories about those things. Invasive, unpleasant… no thank you. And what’s this fecal… whatever you called it? A stool sample? I can do a stool sample, I suppose. But no colonoscopy. I’m too old for all that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance regarding the colonoscopy. However, given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, it is the most thorough way to rule out more serious conditions, such as colon cancer. While it does require bowel preparation, the benefits of early detection far outweigh the inconvenience. However, we can start with the fecal occult blood test. It's a non-invasive test that detects hidden blood in your stool. If that comes back positive, it will necessitate further investigation, and I strongly urge you to reconsider the colonoscopy then. For now, I will order the FOBT. We can also discuss options for managing the hemorrhoids and fissures, such as a high-fiber diet, stool softeners, and topical creams. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Topical creams… alright, that sounds reasonable. And a high-fiber diet. I suppose I can eat more beans. But no colonoscopy. I'm making that very clear. And if this… this bean diet and cream doesn’t fix it, then… well, I guess I'll just live with a little blood. It's not like I'm planning on climbing mountains.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the fecal occult blood test, and I will provide you with instructions on how to collect the sample. I will also write a prescription for a topical cream containing hydrocortisone and a local anesthetic to help soothe the irritation. It's important to monitor your symptoms and report any changes, such as increased bleeding, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. While you may not be planning on climbing mountains, Mr. Rowbottom, early detection of any underlying issue is always beneficial, regardless of your activity level. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No. I think that covers it. Just… get me the instructions for this… this sample thing. And the cream. And try not to bother me again unless it’s absolutely necessary. I've wasted enough time here today.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The instructions are straightforward. It's important to follow them carefully for accurate results. The prescription can be filled at your preferred pharmacy. I understand your reluctance, but please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen or you have any concerns. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Rowbottom.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Thank you.
