DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. It’s disgusting, really. And uncomfortable. I don’t have time for this, you know. Important things to do. It’s just… food, basically. Coming back up. Especially after I eat. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Right. "Stuff coming up," you say. And primarily after eating, correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Do people really need this explained to them? It's pretty straightforward. It happens after meals. Big meals, small meals...doesn't matter. It just comes up. And it doesn’t smell pleasant, if that matters. Honestly, I haven’t even been enjoying my pierogi lately because of it. A good pierogi deserves respect, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, detail is important, Mr. Altine. And I appreciate you mentioning the pierogi. It helps me understand your… distress. So, this "coming up"—is it immediately after eating, or is there a delay?
PATIENT: A delay, usually. Not right away. Maybe… half an hour? An hour, sometimes. It’s not like I eat a bite and instantly… no. It builds up. And then… it happens. I have to excuse myself, you know? It's embarrassing. Look, is this going to take long? I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, delayed, thirty minutes to an hour after eating. And you say it’s… unpleasant. Can you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It tastes like… well, like the food I just ate, only… warmer. And sour. And it burns a little going back down. Not a pleasant sensation, believe me. Honestly, I thought my wife would understand, but she just keeps telling me to eat smaller portions. Like that’s helpful! It’s not the amount of food, it’s…the returning of the food. Do you follow? It’s baffling, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Warm, sour, burning sensation on the way back up. And it happens regardless of portion size. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Well, sometimes my chest feels a little… tight. Like a band around it. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And I burp. A lot. More than usual, anyway. My wife keeps offering me antacids. Those chalky things. They do nothing, you know. Absolutely nothing. Honestly, I don’t know why she bothers. A waste of money.
DOCTOR: Alright, chest tightness and increased burping. And the antacids aren't helping. Have you had any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No, not really. Food goes down fine. It's not like it gets stuck, if that's what you’re asking. It goes down, it sits, and then… well, you know. It comes back up. It’s not a swallowing problem. It's a… a re-emerging problem. A food rebellion, maybe? Look, is this leading somewhere or are we just going to list symptoms all day? I really do have things to do. Very important things.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Altine. I need to gather enough information to understand what's going on. Alright. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I’ve gained weight, if anything. My wife’s been making all sorts of rich Polish dishes… harder to resist when you’re stressed, you know? Though, honestly, enjoying them is becoming difficult with this… situation. It’s just frustrating. It’s not like I’m wasting away, if that’s what you’re implying. Perfectly healthy weight, thank you very much. A little broad, perhaps, but healthy. Now, can we hurry this up?
DOCTOR: Alright, no weight loss, and you’ve gained weight recently. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Nothing major. High blood pressure, the doctor said. Years ago. I take a little pill for it. And… well, I had a bad back once. But that was ages ago. Otherwise, perfectly fine. Robust, even. I used to be a carpenter, you know. Hard work. Built things. Sturdy things. Doesn’t sound like a man with a lot of medical problems, does it? Now, is this all you need to know about my history? I'm beginning to suspect this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of back pain. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s it. A long time ago. Standard procedure, the doctor said. Nothing fancy. And… no, that’s definitely it. No other surgeries. I avoid hospitals if I can help it. Germs everywhere, you know? And long waits. Absolutely dreadful. Now, can we please get to the solution? I’m starting to feel a bit… agitated. I have a very important meeting!
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives—parents, siblings—have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. My mother… she had stomach problems. Always complaining about indigestion. Never quite knew what was wrong with her. And my father… he had a bad heart. Died young, unfortunately. A lot of stress, the doctor said. Worked himself to the bone. That's all I really know. They weren't ones for talking about medical things. It was considered… private. And frankly, I'm finding this line of questioning rather intrusive. Is there a point to all this, Doctor? A solution, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother with stomach problems, father with heart problems. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me. Horrible habit, you know? And bad for the lungs. I prefer a good pierogi, thank you very much. A healthy indulgence. Now, are we getting anywhere with this? I really do have to leave soon. This meeting… it’s with the city council. Very important decisions being made. Decisions, I might add, that impact the entire community. Not just my digestion.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A beer with dinner, maybe. Or a glass of wine. Nothing excessive. I'm not a drinker, if that’s what you’re asking. Just a social beverage. My wife enjoys a little vodka now and then, too. Polish tradition, you know? But we're responsible people. It doesn’t affect my health. Or my… situation. Honestly, I’m beginning to feel like I’m being interrogated. Is there a test you can give me? A pill? Something to fix this? I haven’t got all day. The city council is waiting. And they don't appreciate being kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional alcohol consumption. Now, before we proceed further, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and abdomen, and feel around a bit. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now? Honestly, Doctor, I'm wearing my good trousers. And I have a meeting! A very important meeting, I've already explained. This is ridiculous. Look, just give me something for the… the regurgitation. Something to stop it. A prescription. An antacid. Anything. I don’t need a poking and prodding. I know my body. It's a perfectly fine body, despite this… temporary setback. Give me a pill and let me get going. I haven't got time for examinations. Really. The city council… .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper assessment. Your symptoms—delayed regurgitation, chest tightness, and a history of stomach problems—require investigation. I need to listen to your heart and examine your abdomen to rule out any serious underlying conditions. It is my ethical responsibility to ensure you receive the appropriate care, and that includes a physical examination. Given your insistence and your upcoming meeting, I will compromise. I will perform a brief auscultation of your heart and abdomen. No need to undress. But I must insist on at least that much. If I find anything concerning, I will recommend further testing. Do we agree to that?
