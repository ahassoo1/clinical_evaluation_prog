DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you're 89 years young. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Young is right. Eighty-nine years of dealing with…well, people. It’s my foot, Doctor. Been botherin’ me something awful. A sore, it is. A nasty one. And it won’t heal. I've tried all sorts of things, you know. All sorts.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sore on your foot that isn’t healing can be quite troublesome. “All sorts of things,” you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Salves, mostly. My daughter, bless her heart, sends me things. Fancy creams from the internet. And I soak it, like I’m told. Epsom salts. Hydrogen peroxide. Even tried some of that tea tree oil stuff. Nothing touches it. It just… sits there. And it hurts, Doctor. Especially when I try to walk. Which isn’t as much as it used to be, thankfully. But still. It’s a nuisance. A big one.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you've been quite diligent with home remedies. That's good to hear. And it sounds like this has been going on for a while. Can you tell me exactly where on your foot the sore is located?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on the bottom, of course. Where you stand. Not on the top, silly. It's… right on the ball of my foot, I suppose. Near my big toe. Though it's spreadin', now. It wasn’t just a little spot, you see. It’s… bigger. And deeper. Honestly, it looks dreadful. My daughter won’t even look at it anymore. Says it makes her queasy. Which is just rude, if you ask me. She should be helpin’, not avoidin’ it. But she’s a modern woman, full of… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's located on the ball of your foot, near your big toe, and it has been growing in size. Has it been painful from the beginning, or did the pain develop gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, it started small. Just a little ache, you know? Barely noticeable. I thought it was my shoes. I have so many shoes, you see. Always have. But then it got red. And hot. And tender. And then the pain…well, the pain is a steady throb now. It doesn't really spike, but it’s always there. Especially when I put weight on it. And lately…it smells a bit. Not good. My daughter said so, anyway. She has a very sensitive nose. Honestly, she's such a fussbudget. But she does have a point. It doesn't smell like a rose garden, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Louine. That’s very helpful. It sounds like this has been progressively worsening, and the odor is concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, someone has to look at it, I suppose. I’ve shown it to my daughter, and she nearly fainted. You’re a doctor, aren’t you? That’s what you do. Just… try not to make a face. It’s not a pretty sight. And be gentle. My skin is very thin at my age, you know. Paper thin. I bruise easily. Don’t go pokin’ around too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be very gentle, Louine. I promise. I’ll take a careful look and do my best not to cause any discomfort. Let’s have you sit here, and I’ll just examine your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock on that foot?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Though I warn you, this sock is new. My daughter bought it for me. It’s supposed to be… moisture-wicking. Whatever that means. There. Happy now? It’s as nasty as I said. Don't say I didn't warn you. And be quick about it, please. I don't like havin’ my feet exposed. It’s undignified.
DOCTOR: I see. This is quite extensive, Louine. The skin around the sore is inflamed, and there’s some discoloration. It appears deeper than a simple blister or abrasion. There is a distinct odor present. Is this sore particularly painful when I touch it here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Don't poke! That’s… yes, that hurts. A sharp pain. Not a throbbing, but a sting. Like a bee sting, almost. Though I haven’t been stung by a bee in… oh, decades. A long time. You’re makin’ it worse, you know. Just lookin’ at it’s bad enough, but pokin’ and proddin’… Really, Doctor, you’re not helping my day. My daughter is gonna be furious when she finds out you’ve aggravated it. Honestly, some doctors just don’t have any sensitivity. None at all.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Louine. I didn’t mean to cause you any discomfort. I was just trying to assess the extent of the injury. It sounds like this is quite sensitive, and I will be much more careful. Given the appearance of the sore, its location, the pain you're experiencing, and the odor, I'm concerned about a possible infection. I'd like to get a culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, if there is one. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: A…culture? What’s that involve? Sounds dreadful. Will you be scraping it? Because I really don’t want any scraping. My skin is delicate, you know. And I don’t want any more pokin’ and proddin’. Honestly, all this fuss. I just want it to heal. Is that too much to ask? A simple cure. No cultures, no scraping, no… unpleasantness. My daughter warned me about doctors. She said they love to do tests. And procedures. And charge you a fortune for it. Is that what this is? Another way to line your pockets?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine. A culture involves taking a small sample of the fluid or tissue from the sore with a swab – it’s a very gentle procedure. It doesn't involve scraping, and it’s the best way to determine the specific bacteria causing the infection, if any. Knowing the bacteria allows us to choose the most effective antibiotic to help it heal. It's not about lining my pockets, I assure you. It’s about getting you the right treatment so you can feel better. Without knowing what we’re dealing with, we might use an antibiotic that doesn’t work, and the sore could worsen. If we don't do a culture, the next step would be to start you on a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Would you prefer that?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum…what? Is that like a shotgun approach? Just throwin' everything at it and hopin' somethin' sticks? Honestly, that sounds… reckless. And what if it gives me a stomach ache? My daughter gets the worst stomach aches from antibiotics. She’s very sensitive. But a culture…scraping… Oh dear. And how long will this take? I have a bridge game on Thursday. I can't miss my bridge game. Agnes will have a fit. Fine. Do your culture. But be quick. And be gentle. And don't make a mess. And no scraping! I’m warning you. And I expect a full report. I want to know everything. What kind of bacteria is it? What antibiotic will you use? And how long will it take to heal? I don't have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I promise. The culture itself will only take a few minutes. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results usually come back in 2-3 days. We can discuss the results then and determine the best course of treatment. I will also document your concerns about potential stomach upset and we can explore options to mitigate that if needed. Let me clean the area first and then I will gently take the swab.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… hurry. And don’t use anything cold. I hate cold things on my feet. Makes my bones ache. Honestly, the things I have to put up with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine, all done. That was very quick, and you were very brave. I've labeled the sample, and it will be sent to the lab right away. Now, while we’re waiting for the culture results, I'm going to recommend keeping the area clean and dry, and avoiding putting too much weight on your foot. Do you have any dressing materials at home?
PATIENT: Dressing materials? Oh, my daughter sends all sorts of things. Bandages, mostly. Fancy ones with pictures on them. And some of that…foam stuff. To cushion it. She thinks I need to protect it. Which is nice, I suppose. Though it gets awfully hot under all those layers. I prefer to let it breathe, if possible. But yes, I have bandages. Lots of them. And some of that…antibacterial ointment. Does that stuff even work? My late husband swore by it, but he believed in all sorts of things. He used to say a little bit of vinegar would cure anything. Honestly, it's just a lot of fuss. I wish it would just heal.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine. It sounds like you've tried many things already. The antibacterial ointment can be helpful in preventing further infection, but it won't necessarily treat an existing one. We'll know more once the culture results are back. For now, continue to keep the area clean and dry, and use a bandage to protect it. If you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Increased pain…redness…swelling… Oh, goodness. That sounds dreadful. Well, I suppose I'll be watching for all that. It's just… I don't want to end up in the hospital. My late husband spent his last days in the hospital. Not a pleasant experience. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just…hurry with those results, will you? And please, don’t let my daughter find out I came to the doctor without telling her. She'll have a fit. Honestly, she treats me like a child. Alright. I suppose I'll be going now. Thank you… Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. I understand your concerns, and I will make sure to document your preference regarding your daughter. We will do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if you notice any worsening symptoms, please call right away. Have a good day, Louine. And be careful on your way home.
PATIENT: Hmph. Good day to you too, Doctor. And try not to let Agnes hear about this. She’ll never let me live it down. Honestly, the things I have to put up with… .
