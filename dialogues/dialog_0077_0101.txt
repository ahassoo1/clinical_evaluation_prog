DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this headache, you see. Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not a terrible pain, but…constant, like. Never really goes away completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant headache at the back of the head… I see. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think now. It started…oh, maybe a month ago? A little over, perhaps. It wasn’t bad at first, just a dull ache. But it’s been gettin’ a bit stronger, if you know what I mean. Still not crippling, mind you. I can still work, but it's there, always. Especially after a long day on my feet. I’m a manicurist, you see, so lots of standin’.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you mentioned it’s worse after being on your feet all day. Are there any other things that seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question. Let me see...Bright lights bother it a bit, I think. Not like I gotta run and hide, but they don't help, you know? And if I get really stressed…that makes it worse too. My wife, bless her heart, she worries about everything! That definitely doesn’t help the headache. As for better…hmm. Laying down helps, I suppose. And a cool cloth on the back of my neck. But nothin’ makes it go away completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, so bright lights and stress seem to aggravate it, and rest and a cool cloth offer some relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Let me think…no nausea, no dizziness. Not seein' any spots or blurry vision. No pain anywhere else, just the back of my head. Sometimes, when it’s really bad, my neck feels a bit stiff. Not always, though. And…oh! Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I'm eighty-seven years old, Doctor! I expect a little tiredness. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Alright, no nausea, dizziness, or vision changes. A bit of neck stiffness sometimes, and understandable tiredness. Let me just check a few things… Could you turn your head slowly to the left…and now to the right?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There we go. Feels a little tight on this side, you see? Not painful exactly, just…stiff. Like somethin’s pulled. Is that what you’re checkin’ for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m checking for. And I’m noting some tenderness there. I also want to check your blood pressure and pulse, just to get a complete picture. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is regular at 78. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Hmm. I had a touch of high blood pressure years ago, the doctor told me, but I haven't taken any pills for it in…oh, must be twenty years now. Felt alright without 'em. As for other conditions…arthritis in my hands, of course. Bein’ a manicurist! But nothin' major. No diabetes, no heart trouble. Just the arthritis and this headache now. And the high blood pressure, I suppose, if it's still botherin' you.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and a history of high blood pressure. And you haven't been taking anything for the blood pressure for twenty years… Mr. Popova, I'm concerned about this headache combined with the elevated blood pressure. While it could be a tension headache related to your work and stress, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out anything serious. We should also consider checking your thyroid. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? Hmm. Sounds sensible, Doctor. I always figured I should get that done. I’ve been puttin’ it off, to be honest. But if you think it’s best… yes, let’s do the blood work. And the thyroid, too, if you think so. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what I gotta do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. It will involve a small blood sample. While we wait for the results, I recommend you try to manage your stress levels and avoid bright lights as much as possible. I'm also going to recommend a low-sodium diet and regular, gentle exercise. I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are in, usually within a few days. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Low sodium, you say? Gentle exercise… alright, alright. I can try. My wife will be happy to hear that, she's always naggin' me to take a walk! No, I don't think I have any questions right now, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me. I appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the results. And remember, try to get some rest and manage your stress. We'll figure this out. Have a good day.
