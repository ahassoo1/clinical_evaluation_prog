DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Julie, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Julie, Burdette Julie. Honestly, I don't see why we're going over this again. My time is quite valuable, you know. Let's just get to why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Julie. My apologies. I just like to confirm everything. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… rather obvious, isn’t it? The chart should say. Sudden… difficulties. With seeing and hearing. It came on quite quickly, and it’s terribly inconvenient. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the notes here about “sudden difficulties.” Can you elaborate on those, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly. It’s just… everything is blurry. Like looking through a fog. And sounds are… muffled. Distant. I can’t quite make out what people are saying, and I certainly don't need to repeat myself! It started… oh dear, when did it start? A few days ago, I suppose. It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. Now, are we done yet?
DOCTOR: A few days ago... blurry vision and muffled hearing. Any associated symptoms?
PATIENT: Associated… symptoms? Goodness. Let me think. Well, I've been feeling rather… irritable. More so than usual, perhaps. And a bit… lightheaded, I suppose. Though that could just be from the stress of this whole ordeal. And… no, I can't think of anything else. Really, I just want to be able to see and hear again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Irritability and lightheadedness… alright. Have you had any fever, headache, dizziness, or any weakness or numbness?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You're asking me a lot of questions. A headache, yes, perhaps a slight one. A dull ache, nothing significant. And… no, no dizziness. Definitely no weakness or numbness. I’m a surgeon, you know. I have excellent control of my faculties. This is all very… unsettling. I just want a quick answer, if that's possible. Is there something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Julie. I understand your frustration. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Can you follow my pen with your eyes?
PATIENT: Follow your pen? Honestly. Must we? I have appointments, you know. Very important appointments. But… fine. If it will speed things along. Hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you tell me when you start to see double?
PATIENT: Double? I… I'm not seeing double. Everything is just blurry. It’s… it’s difficult to explain. It’s like looking at a painting that hasn’t quite dried yet. Everything is… smudged. Honestly, are you even a real doctor? This is taking far too long. I need to know what’s causing this now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's check your hearing. I'm going to put this tuning fork on your forehead, and you tell me when you can no longer hear it. Just let me know.
PATIENT: Honestly, a tuning fork? What is this, the dark ages? Very well. I suppose I have no choice. It’s… fading. Fading… Yes, I can't hear it anymore. Now? Can we please get to the bottom of this? I'm a very busy woman. And I don't appreciate wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears there is some hearing loss. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, but there is some mild congestion in the lungs.
PATIENT: Congestion? Goodness gracious. What does that mean? Am I getting a cold? This is ridiculous. I haven’t had time to be sick in decades. Honestly, you’re alarming me now. Is this serious? Will I have to cancel my appointments? This is just… unacceptable. Tell me straight, doctor. Is there something terribly wrong with me? I need to know. Now.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Julie, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. Your symptoms – sudden vision and hearing loss, lightheadedness, and mild congestion – could be caused by a number of things. It could be something relatively minor, but it’s also important to rule out more serious possibilities, such as a stroke or an inner ear infection. I’m going to order a CT scan and an MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, as well as a blood test to check for any signs of infection. I also recommend a referral to an ENT specialist for a more thorough hearing evaluation. Would you like me to arrange that for you?
PATIENT: A CT scan? An MRI? Honestly! This is escalating far too quickly. All of this… testing. It sounds terribly expensive. And time-consuming. An ENT specialist? Goodness. Look, doctor, I’m a very practical woman. I don’t have time for endless procedures. Is there anything… simpler we can do? A medication, perhaps? Something quick and easy? I simply don’t have the bandwidth for all of this. And frankly, I doubt it’s anything serious. I’ve always been remarkably healthy. Just… give me something for the headache and let me get on with my life. Now. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Julie, I understand your concerns about time and expense. However, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis could be… irresponsible. It’s essential to determine the cause of your symptoms before initiating any treatment. I will not prescribe medication without knowing what we're treating. It could mask a more serious underlying condition. I strongly recommend you proceed with the testing. I can certainly expedite the process and arrange everything as quickly as possible. We can schedule the CT scan and MRI for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I can prescribe a mild pain reliever for the headache, but that’s all. Do you agree to proceed with the testing?
PATIENT: Honestly, you doctors are all the same. So rigid. So… unwilling to listen. Fine. Fine! Do your tests. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full refund. And I want a detailed explanation of everything. No medical jargon, mind you. I’m a surgeon, not a neurologist. And expedite it, you said? Tomorrow morning. Don't you dare keep me waiting. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have appointments to reschedule. And a life to get back to. Let’s just get this over with. .
