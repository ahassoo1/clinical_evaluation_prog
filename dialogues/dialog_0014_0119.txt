DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? It’s a rather… delicate matter, truthfully. And not one a lady typically discusses with… well, anyone. But my niece insisted. She said I had to get it checked. It’s… a discharge. From… down there. It’s quite unpleasant, really. And it started just a few days ago. I’ve never had anything like it before.
DOCTOR: Yes, Osterholm. And you’re right to get it checked, good for your niece. A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. And it’s… not normal. I mean, I’ve always been very… clean. Very particular about my hygiene, you understand. So it’s quite shocking, frankly. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And it has… an odor. A rather unpleasant odor. I’ve tried… washing it, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Honestly, I'm a bit embarrassed to even be talking about this. Is this… common?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Wartick, it’s certainly not something anyone enjoys discussing, but it is… relatively common. A yellowish discharge with an odor… could be a number of things. We’ll need to get a bit more information. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain alongside the discharge?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thankfully. And the itching is… minimal. Just a slight… irritation, really. It’s not constant, comes and goes. But the smell… that’s the most bothersome part. It’s… fishy, I suppose is the best way to describe it. Though I haven’t been eating much fish lately, so I don’t understand why it would smell like that. And I haven’t been with… anyone… for quite some time, so it’s not that sort of thing, if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s simply… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, minimal itching, fishy odor… and you haven’t been sexually active recently, you said. Good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes in… my urination? Well, now that you mention it… perhaps a little. It seems I have to go more often than usual, yes. And it… stings a bit when I start. Not terribly, but enough to notice. I thought it was just because of the heat, truthfully. It’s been dreadfully hot lately. But perhaps that’s connected? Is that what you’re asking about? I do try to drink plenty of water, you know. It’s important for… everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Increased frequency and a stinging sensation during urination… could be related. We’ll need to rule out a urinary tract infection, or UTI. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever, thankfully. And certainly no chills. I get enough of those in the winter, I don’t need any extra! And my back… well, I’m an older woman, Doctor. My back always aches a little. It’s just part of getting older, you know. I wouldn’t say it’s worse than usual. Although… I did bend over to pick up a dropped can of peaches yesterday, and it did feel a bit strained afterwards. But that's just a strained muscle, I imagine. Not a fever or anything dramatic like that. Honestly, this whole thing is rather distressing. I just want it to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. No fever, no significant back pain beyond usual aches… Let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I'll just take a look. And we'll likely send a urine sample to the lab to confirm whether it is a UTI. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… an exam? I suppose so. Though I must say, I’m not particularly fond of… those instruments. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can endure it. And a urine sample… yes, I can manage that. It’s just… the thought of everything. It’s all rather… invasive. But if it will get to the bottom of things, then very well. Just… please be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It won't be comfortable, but it shouldn’t be terribly painful. First, let’s collect the urine sample. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Then we'll do a quick pelvic exam. I'll explain everything as I go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam… Oh dear. Well… will it be… uncomfortable? I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. And will I need to… undress completely? Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… daunting. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. And that you can tell me what’s going on afterward. I’m not very good with medical jargon, you see. I prefer things explained in… plain English.
DOCTOR: It may be a little uncomfortable, yes, but we’ll take it slow. You will need to undress from the waist down. I’ll provide a gown and a sheet for privacy. I will explain everything before I do it, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. And I promise to explain the results in plain English, no jargon. We’ll start with the urine sample, then we’ll proceed to the exam at your pace. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… at my pace, you say? Yes, that’s… reassuring. Very well. A gown and a sheet… and no medical jargon. I suppose I can manage that. But please be quick, Doctor. And gentle. I really do appreciate you explaining things beforehand. It makes it… less frightening. Where is this cup, then? And what exactly do I need to do with it? I hope it’s not too complicated. Honestly, this whole situation is just… dreadful. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Right this way. The bathroom is just down the hall. There’s a cup in there, along with instructions. It's a “clean catch” sample, so try to collect the mid-stream of your urine. I'll explain it briefly: start urinating, then catch the urine in the cup after a few seconds. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect, just do your best. Take your time, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Just knock when you’re ready. And remember, just do your best. It’s okay if it's a little messy. We're just looking for a sample, not perfection.
PATIENT: A "clean catch"... Oh dear. More instructions. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather complicated for a simple urine sample. Mid-stream… that sounds… messy. I hope I can manage it. I suppose I should go, then. And knock when I’m finished? Very well. I’ll try my best. I really do hope this doesn’t take too long. And that it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Wartick. And don't hesitate to call out if you need any help. I’ll be right here. Just focus on doing your best, and we’ll take it from there. Don't worry about making it perfect. I'll be waiting.
