DOCTOR: "Bula, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello. It's… my ear, I think. Feels blocked. Full, like. Honestly, I don't really… remember how it started. Just… is full. I’d like to get it sorted, if that's alright. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a blocked ear. I understand. And you're right, we'll see what we can do to get it sorted quickly. It’s common to not remember exactly when something started, so don’t worry about that. Just tell me a bit more about the fullness. Is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Just the one, I think. The… left one. Yes, definitely the left. It’s hard to tell sometimes, honestly. Things aren’t what they used to be, you know? I just notice it more when it’s quiet. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “It absolutely makes sense. It’s very common to notice ear issues more in quiet environments. Okay, so the left ear feels full, especially when it's quiet. Is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Just… a pressure, maybe? Like when you go up in a plane, that sort of feeling. But not bad pain. And it hasn’t gotten worse, I don’t think. It’s just… annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so no pain, just a pressure, similar to what you’d feel on an airplane, and it hasn’t been worsening. That's good to know. Have you noticed any ringing in your ear, or any dizziness or changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe a little. Very faint. I mostly notice it at night, when it’s quiet. As for dizziness… no, not really. I’m a bit clumsy, always have been, but I don’t think that’s related. Hearing… I suppose it’s a bit muffled, but I thought that was just… getting older.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so a little ringing, especially at night, and some muffled hearing. It’s good you’re able to differentiate that feeling from general age-related changes. And it's okay to acknowledge those changes! Let’s do a quick look in your ear, and I’ll listen with my stethoscope, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, yes, that sounds… good. The sooner we get it done, the better. I don't like having things poked at, if I’m honest. But, yes. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly understandable. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just need to take a look in your ear canal to see if there’s any wax buildup or anything obvious. It might feel a little cool. Then I’ll listen to the sounds in your ear with this.” “Okay, I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – but nothing that looks like a blockage or infection. Your eardrum looks normal. Now, let's listen with the stethoscope.” “Okay, hearing is slightly reduced on the left side, as you mentioned, but it’s not a significant reduction. There doesn’t appear to be any fluid behind the eardrum.”
PATIENT: Right. So… what does that mean? Is it serious? I have things to do, you know. I don't have time for… complications.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern about complications and wanting to get back to your routine. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it doesn’t sound like anything serious, thankfully. It appears you have a mild buildup of earwax, which is pretty common, and that's likely contributing to the feeling of fullness, muffled hearing, and the slight ringing. It’s not an infection or anything that needs immediate aggressive treatment.” “We can try a simple earwax removal. We can either do it here in the office with a special irrigation system, or I can prescribe some ear drops to soften the wax, and it should come out on its own over a few days. Which option would you prefer?
PATIENT: Ear drops, I think. Less… poking. I don't like things going in my ear. How long will they take to work? And… will I need to come back? Because I really don't want to come back.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, ear drops it is! No poking at all, I promise. Usually, the drops take about 3-7 days to soften the wax enough for it to come out on its own. You’ll lie on your side with the affected ear facing up, put a few drops in, and stay like that for 5-10 minutes. Then gently wipe away any excess. It’s best to do it at night before bed.” “I'll write you a prescription for Ceruminol. If it doesn't improve after a week, then yes, it would be best to come back so we can safely remove the wax. But let's start with the drops and see how it goes. I'll also give you some written instructions on how to use them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. A week. And then I don’t have to come back if it works? Good. Instructions would be helpful, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Thank you. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: “Perfect. Absolutely, you can go now. You shouldn't need to come back if the drops resolve the issue. Here are the written instructions, detailing how to use the ear drops, what to expect, and when to contact the office if you experience any problems.” “If you have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, and I hope your ear feels much better soon!”
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. Yes. Goodbye.
