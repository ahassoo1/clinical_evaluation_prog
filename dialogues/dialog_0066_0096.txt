DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Condray, good to meet you too. Well, it’s this sensitivity to light, really. It’s been bothering me for a bit now. Feels like my eyes are extra bothered by the sun, even with sunglasses.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to light… that’s photophobia. And you said “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Yeah, photophobia, that sounds right. And “a bit”... hmm, maybe three or four months, I’d say. It started slowly, just noticing the sun felt brighter, but it’s gotten worse. It’s not painful, exactly, more just… really uncomfortable and makes me squint a lot. Especially on really bright days.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four months, gradually worsening. Uncomfortable, squinting… not painful. Good to clarify that. Have you noticed it being worse at any other times, besides bright days?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… Not really worse at other times, but sometimes it feels a bit…off… when I'm looking at screens for too long, like my computer at work. Not always, though. Just sometimes after a long shift.
DOCTOR: Okay, sometimes with prolonged screen time. And what do you do at work, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: No problem at all. I'm a dental assistant. So lots of bright lights and looking at people's mouths all day, which… now that I say it out loud, maybe that has something to do with it? It's a lot of close-up work, and they use pretty strong lamps.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Arbin. Being a dental assistant with those bright lights… that definitely could be a contributing factor. Before we go further, can you tell me if you've had any other symptoms alongside the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. My vision feels okay, no blurriness or double vision. No headaches or anything like that. Just the light bothering my eyes. I did have a really bad cold a couple months before the light sensitivity started, but I felt completely better after a week or so. Don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blurriness, double vision, or headaches. A cold a couple of months prior, but you felt fully recovered. Good to know. Have you noticed any discharge from your eyes, or any redness?
PATIENT: No, no discharge or redness at all. My eyes feel normal except for the light thing. They don’t feel dry or itchy, either. Just… sensitive. It's just weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, no discharge, redness, dryness, or itchiness. So just the sensitivity to light. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy before… well, before my wife passed away. That was about a year ago now. It's been tough, but I've been trying to take care of myself. Otherwise, no major health issues. I have Medicare, if that matters. And I take a daily multivitamin, just something to keep me going.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Arbin. That must have been incredibly difficult. And it’s good that you’re focusing on taking care of yourself. Medicare is good to know, and a multivitamin is fine. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven’t had any problems with any medications in the past. I did get stung by a bee when I was a kid, but just a normal reaction, a little swelling and itchiness. Nothing serious. My mum always said I was a tough kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And no history of serious reactions. Now, have you ever had any eye problems or surgeries before?
PATIENT: No, never. My eyesight’s always been pretty good, to be honest. I don’t wear glasses or contacts. I’ve never had any injuries to my eyes, and I’ve never had any surgery on them or anything like that. I always thought I’d need reading glasses eventually, like my dad, but so far, so good.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of eye problems or surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had any eye conditions, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mum had cataracts when she got older, I think. She had surgery for them, and it helped a lot. My dad, he just needed glasses as he got older, nothing serious. I don’t think anyone else in the family has had any other eye problems that I know of. My mum’s side, they mostly have high blood pressure, and my dad’s side, just normal old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mum had cataracts, your dad needed glasses. Mostly age-related issues in the family. Last question on the history side: do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I hardly drink at all. Maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year, with dinner, if I'm feeling fancy. Mostly I drink water. Gotta stay hydrated!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol consumption. Excellent. Now, let's do a quick examination of your eyes. I’m going to check your vision, look at the structures of your eyes, and test your pupils. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Sounds good. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable or anything.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, Arbin, can you read the letters on this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… uh… the top line is… E… F… P… L… Okay. The next line… C… K… T… O… H… It's a bit blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that too. Let’s try that again, and don't worry if you can't see them clearly. Just do your best. With both eyes open, can you read the top line?
PATIENT: Okay… E… F… P… L… Yes, I can see those. But it’s still a bit… fuzzy. Everything looks a little washed out, if that makes sense. It’s like looking through a slightly dirty window.
DOCTOR: Okay, “washed out” is a good description. Alright, let me just check your pupils now. I’m going to shine a light in your eyes. Just look straight ahead. Your pupils seem to be reacting normally, but a bit slower than usual. Now, I’m going to check the structures of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won’t hurt, but it might be a little bright. Just look straight ahead. Okay, the back of your eyes look mostly normal, but I notice a slight paleness of the optic nerve. I’m going to check your eye pressure now. This will involve a puff of air into each eye. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it won't hurt. Okay, your eye pressure is normal. Everything seems relatively normal so far, but the sluggish pupils and paleness of the optic nerve are a little concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, it's difficult to say exactly what's going on. My initial thought is that this could be a mild optic neuritis, possibly related to a past viral infection, or it could be something else entirely. It is important to rule out any serious neurological issues.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a bit scary. Optic neuritis? I did have that cold a couple months ago, like I said. Is that something serious? And what does “rule out neurological issues” mean? I just want to be able to see again properly.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Arbin. It can be scary to hear those terms, but let's not jump to conclusions. Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve, which is the nerve that transmits signals from your eyes to your brain. It can be caused by a viral infection, like the cold you had, but it can also be caused by other things. The good news is that it's often treatable, especially if we catch it early. When I say “rule out neurological issues”, I mean we need to make sure this isn't being caused by something more serious affecting your brain or nervous system. Things like multiple sclerosis can sometimes cause optic neuritis, so we need to investigate to be sure. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain and optic nerves. This will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. I’m also going to order blood tests to check for any inflammation or underlying conditions. Based on the results of these tests, we can determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and protecting your eyes from bright light. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… an MRI… and blood tests. That sounds… a lot. Will the MRI show everything? And what if it is something like… multiple sclerosis? What does that even mean? I don’t understand any of this medical stuff. And… will I be able to see again? Is there anything I can do now to help, besides avoiding bright light? I feel really lost.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, and it’s completely understandable to feel lost right now. Let's break it down. The MRI will give us detailed images of your brain and optic nerves, allowing us to see if there’s any inflammation or damage. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. As for multiple sclerosis, it’s a chronic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It causes the immune system to attack the protective covering of the nerves, which can lead to a variety of symptoms. If the MRI shows signs of MS, we would refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – for further evaluation and treatment. It's not a death sentence, and there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. Protecting your eyes from bright light is important, as it can worsen your symptoms. Also, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. I'm going to prescribe you a short course of oral corticosteroids to help reduce the inflammation. I understand this is a lot to take in, and you have every right to be worried. But we're going to take it one step at a time. We'll get the MRI scheduled as soon as possible, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist just in case, so you have that option available to you. Do you want me to write down the name of the neurologist and the details of the MRI appointment for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be really helpful. And… thank you. For explaining everything, and for not… talking down to me. It’s just… a lot to process. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and answer all my questions. I’m also a bit worried about the cost of all this… Medicare should cover most of it, right? I don’t want to end up with a huge bill.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. It's my job to explain things clearly and make sure you feel comfortable. And it’s perfectly okay to be worried about the cost. Here you go. This has Dr. Eleanor Vance’s information – she’s a very good neurologist. And this is the address and phone number for the imaging center where we’ll get the MRI done. Medicare should cover most of the costs, but there may be a deductible or co-pay. I’m going to have our billing department contact you to confirm your coverage and discuss any potential out-of-pocket expenses. They can also help you with any pre-authorization requirements. I’ll also give you a prescription for the corticosteroids. It's important to take them as directed, even if you start to feel better. And if you experience any side effects, please don't hesitate to contact me. I want you to know that we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. We'll get through this together. Do you have any further questions for me today, Arbin?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Condray. Really, thank you. I feel… a little less scared, knowing we have a plan. I'll call the billing department and try to schedule the MRI as soon as possible. And I'll take the corticosteroids as you prescribed. I appreciate your patience and kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the MRI results. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
