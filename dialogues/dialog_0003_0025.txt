DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, you’re here today… for what reason, precisely?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… I want to know about my family. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test with spit? To see… ancestors? That’s right. Ancestors.
DOCTOR: Ancestry testing… Yes, well, that is available, though it’s not strictly a medical service, Mr. Scobie. We don’t typically offer genealogical assessments here at the clinic. It’s… a rather recreational pursuit, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Re…cre-ation? No, no. Not play. I just… always wonder. My mama, she tell stories, but… stories change, you know? When people get old. I want to know for sure. Is… is it okay if you do it? I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, my expertise lies in medicine. While I understand your… curiosity, this isn’t something I routinely perform, and frankly, it doesn't fall within the scope of family practice. It’s a bit outside my purview. However… there are companies that specialize in such testing. I can provide you with a brochure, if you’d like. Before we proceed further, are you experiencing any current medical concerns?
PATIENT: Companies? Hmmm. Okay. But… is it safe? These companies… they take my spit, and… what then? I don’t want them to… I don’t know… sell it. And… no. No sickness right now. Just… old. And curious.
DOCTOR: “Safe” is a relative term, Mr. Scobie. Reputable companies adhere to privacy regulations, HIPAA for example, though, naturally, there are always risks with any data collection. I can’t vouch for the practices of every establishment. As for your… current state, being "old" is not a medical condition, though it does necessitate more frequent check-ups. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Sleep… sometimes good, sometimes not. Like the ocean, you know? Sometimes calm, sometimes waves. Appetite… eat when I’m hungry, don’t when I’m not. Used to eat more fish. Hard to get good fish now. I guess that’s all. It’s just… this family thing. I want to tell my granddaughter. Before… before I’m not around to tell her.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I won’t be facilitating this ancestry test, let’s focus on your health. Have you had a physical examination recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so. Maybe last year? Hard to remember. Old age, you know. The doctor before… she moved away. To the city. Bigger hospital, she said. I just… I want to know where I come from. It feels important.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, dwelling on the past won’t improve your present health. Let’s conduct a basic assessment. Height and weight first, if you please. Then we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's a far more productive use of our time. If you could step onto the scale, please.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. You’re right. Health first. But… after the health… can you maybe just tell me which company you would trust? Just a little help?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll make a note of a few reputable companies. However, I must reiterate, I am not endorsing them. This is simply a list for your consideration. Now, please, stand still on the scale. We need an accurate weight. It's 56 kilograms, Mr. Scobie. And your height is recorded as 1.55 meters. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's right. 1.55. Not very tall, but strong when I was young. Worked with wood, you know. Built canoes. Good wood.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, if you could step over here, please. We’ll take your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with things like that. Used to use a lot of wood, like I said. Everything natural.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, just relax your arm. I'm going to inflate the cuff. 140 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath. Breathing sounds are… clear. A few minor crepitations, but common for someone your age. Do you have any difficulty breathing, especially when lying down?
PATIENT: No trouble breathing, Doctor. Sometimes a little tired after walking up the hill, but that’s just old age, I think. My granddaughter… she wants me to move to the city with her. Easier living, she says. But I like it here.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Good. And now the other side. Normal reflexes. All appears within reasonable parameters for your age. Now, before we conclude, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Except… about the test. Just… which company? If you had to choose. For… for your own family.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I’ve already stated my reluctance to recommend a specific company. However… if pressed, I suppose 23andMe and AncestryDNA are… relatively well-known. But please, do your own due diligence. Read the privacy policies carefully. I cannot emphasize enough that I am not responsible for their practices. Now, if there is nothing further, I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in six months for a routine check-up. Have a pleasant day. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. 23andMe… and AncestryDNA. I will look. Thank you. Thank you for listening to an old man's stories. Bye bye to you too, Doctor. .
