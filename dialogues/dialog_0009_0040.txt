DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain… in my side, you see. It keeps coming back, and then I get these… water infections, I think they call them. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and recurrent water infections, as you call them. Let's get a bit more detail about both of those things. First, let's talk about the pain. Can you tell me exactly where on your side you’re feeling it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s… it’s on my right side, mostly. Not right on my hip, but a bit higher up, towards my back. And it sort of goes around, you know? Not a sharp pain, usually. More of a dull ache, but it can get quite bad sometimes. It feels… deep inside, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, a dull ache on your right side, higher up towards your back, and it sometimes gets quite bad. And you describe it as deep inside. Has anything in particular been making it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It's funny, really. I haven't noticed anything specific making it worse, not that I can think of. I haven't done anything different lately. As for better… well, lying down sometimes helps. But it always comes back, even if I’m resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lying down provides some relief, but it’s not a lasting solution. And nothing specific seems to trigger it. Now, you mentioned these “water infections”. How often have you been experiencing those, and what makes you think that’s what they are?
PATIENT: Well, I'd say... maybe three or four times in the last year? It’s the burning feeling when I go to the toilet, and I have to go very often. The nurse at the clinic down the road always said it was a water infection, so I just assumed it was the same thing each time. She gave me some tablets each time, and they usually cleared it up. But they keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three or four times in the last year, with symptoms of burning during urination and frequent trips to the bathroom. The nurse at your local clinic diagnosed them as urinary infections and prescribed antibiotics which provided temporary relief. Just to clarify, have you ever had a formal urine test – you know, where they send a sample to the lab to confirm it's an infection?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so, Doctor. The nurse used a little stick to test it at the clinic, right there while I waited. But I don’t recall ever sending anything off to a lab. Just the stick test, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A quick dipstick test is helpful, but it doesn’t always give us the full picture. It's possible we need to do a more thorough test. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. Years ago, when I was in my fifties, the doctor told me I had something with my kidneys… polycystic kidney disease, I think it was called? It wasn't causing me any trouble then, so I didn't really think much of it. He said I would need to keep an eye on it, but… it wasn't bothering me, so I didn't go back for check-ups or anything.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… that's important information. It's a genetic condition where cysts grow on the kidneys. And you haven’t had any follow-up appointments related to that diagnosis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's right. Nothing at all. I felt fine, and the doctor didn't say I needed anything, so I just… carried on as normal. It wasn't until this pain started, and then the water infections, that I started to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that was a long time ago. Aside from that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had problems with her kidneys too. I don’t remember exactly what, but I know she was always going to the doctor for it. And my older brother… he was always sick, generally. He passed away a few years ago, and I think it was something to do with his kidneys as well, but I wasn’t really involved in his medical care.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of kidney problems, with both your mother and brother experiencing issues. That's helpful information. Finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live on my own in a small cottage. I used to work as a receptionist, but I retired about ten years ago. I enjoy gardening, when the weather's good. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruit and vegetables, but I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea! I walk the dog most days, a little terrier called Rosie.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. No smoking, limited alcohol, healthy diet, and regular walks with Rosie. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for providing me with all of that information. Based on what you've told me – the pain in your right side, recurrent urinary infections, history of polycystic kidney disease, and family history of kidney problems – I think we need to investigate this further. I'd like to start with a physical examination, and then order some blood and urine tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Anything that might help me feel better, I’m happy to do. A physical examination and tests… yes, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs – I’m going to take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and check your oxygen levels. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen – that means I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but otherwise everything sounds normal. I did notice some mild tenderness when I pressed on your right side, but nothing too concerning. Now, I'd like to collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a container, and I’ll explain how to collect a "clean catch" sample. It’s important to clean the area first to avoid contamination. Then I'll send that off to the lab, along with some blood work to check your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A urine sample and blood work… I can manage that. Just tell me how to do the clean catch properly, and I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a cleansing wipe, and the cup. Before you collect the sample, please wipe from front to back to clean the area. Then, start urinating into the toilet, and after about halfway through, collect the sample mid-stream into this cup. Don't touch the inside of the cup, and then screw the lid on tightly. And please bring it to the nurse on your way out. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Wipe, start going, then collect mid-stream… and don’t touch the cup. Mid-stream is the important bit, isn't it? I’ll do my best to get it right. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.
DOCTOR: Yes, mid-stream is the most important part – that gives us the cleanest sample. You’re very welcome. Okay, once the nurse has the sample, and I have the blood work results, we’ll have a clearer picture of what’s going on. It will take a few days to get everything back. I’ll call you with the results as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or significant pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you head off to provide the sample?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. Fever, chills, nausea… I'll remember that. I’ll go and give the sample to the nurse now. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel a little bit better just knowing what’s being done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That’s good to hear. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions while she’s collecting the sample. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. I will see you soon, then.
