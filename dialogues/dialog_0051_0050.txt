DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this cough. Been… a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Not much… not much to it, if you know what I mean. Doesn’t bring anything up. Just… bothersome. It’s hard to say when it started, exactly. Seems like… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough that’s been going on for a while. You said it’s been difficult to pinpoint when it started… can you recall if anything specific happened around the time you think it may have begun?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Oh dear. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days. I used to work with cars, you see. Body work. Lots of dust, I suppose. Could be that? Or… maybe after my wife, May… passed. It’s been a few years now, she’s gone. Everything feels… mixed up. I really don't remember when it started, Doctor. Sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s perfectly understandable that things might be a little hazy. We’ll work through it. You mentioned working with cars… and your wife May passing a few years ago. I see here you're 90 years old. And the chart indicates a height of 155 centimeters and a weight of 107 pounds. Now, besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, the weight. I don’t eat much these days. Not like I used to. Everything tastes… different. Other symptoms… let me think. I get… tired easily. Very easily. And sometimes… sometimes my breath gets a little short. Not always, just… when I walk. Or… if I try to do something around the house. Nothing serious, I don’t think. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and shortness of breath, particularly with activity. And a decreased appetite. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or chest pain with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Not recently. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but just… old age, I figure. Night sweats… no. No, I haven’t had any of those. And chest pain… no, not really. It's just… tight. My chest feels tight when I try to… you know, do things. But not pain. Just… uncomfortable. Is that making sense, Doctor? I’m probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Pavlovic. This is all very helpful. So, to recap: a long-standing dry cough, fatigue, decreased appetite, and shortness of breath with activity accompanied by a feeling of chest tightness, but no fever, chills, night sweats, or chest pain. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. The doctor… back in the city… a long time ago… he checked me up, of course. But I don't recall any specific… diagnoses. Maybe high blood pressure, once? Or something like that? But it wasn’t serious. I don't take any pills, if that helps. And… I don't have insurance, so I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. It's all very hazy. Sorry again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Pavlovic. It's completely alright. So, no known medical conditions, no current medications, and you haven’t been to a doctor regularly due to lack of insurance. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, if that's alright. Did any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have any health problems like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… My wife, May… her mother had something… with her lungs, I think. She smoked, you see. A lot. She got sick, a long time ago. That was… before we moved here. As for my parents… they both lived long lives, as far as I remember. Healthy, mostly. My brother… he had a bad heart, I think. He died young, sadly. But… that was a long time ago. It’s hard to say what exactly… I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. You’re doing just fine. Your wife’s mother with lung issues from smoking, and your brother with heart problems… that’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Have you ever smoked yourself?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. May smoked, like I said, but I always told her to stop. She never listened, though. But me? Never. Always thought it was a bad habit. Always. I used to drink a little, sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe. But not much these days. Doesn't taste good anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, Mr. Pavlovic, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen levels, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. I’m hearing some crackles in your lungs, which could indicate fluid buildup, and a slight murmur, which we’ll need to investigate further. Your oxygen saturation is a little low at 92%, but that could be due to a number of factors. Your chest is also tender to the touch. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing now, it sounds like you may have some underlying lung issues, potentially chronic bronchitis or even early signs of pneumonia. The fatigue, shortness of breath and cough fit with that. Your weight loss is also concerning. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Pneumonia? That sounds… serious. X-ray and blood work… yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. But… will it cost a lot? I don’t have much money, you see. And no insurance. I just want to feel better, Doctor. That’s all. Will it help me feel better?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovic. Pneumonia can be serious, but we're not definitively diagnosing that yet. The X-ray and blood work will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Regarding the cost, I'm aware you don’t have insurance. Let me see what options are available. This clinic has a financial assistance program, and we can explore that. I will also ask the billing department to see if we can work out a payment plan. We will do our best to make sure cost isn't a barrier to getting you the care you need. The goal is to figure out what's causing your symptoms so we can get you feeling better. The X-ray will show us if there's any fluid or infection in your lungs, and the blood work will help us rule out other possibilities. Are you comfortable with me ordering those tests now?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Please. I trust you, Doctor. If it will help me feel better, I want to do it. Financial assistance… a payment plan… that would be wonderful. I appreciate it very much. Just… please, let me know if it’s going to cost a lot before you do anything. I don’t want any surprises. Thank you, Doctor. You seem like a kind man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. I assure you, I'll keep you informed of all costs before proceeding. I'll put in the orders for the chest X-ray and blood work now. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and we'll draw the blood samples as well. It will take a little while to get the results back, likely a couple of days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you take things easy, avoid strenuous activity, and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… take care of me, please. I’m an old man, and I don’t have many people to help me. Thank you again. For everything. I’ll… I’ll wait here for the X-ray, then. And I’ll try to take it easy, like you said.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. We will do our best to take good care of you. A nurse will be in shortly to take you for the X-ray. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today.
