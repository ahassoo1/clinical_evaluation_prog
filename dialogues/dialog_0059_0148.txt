DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. It’s… in my… testicles, I believe. Though, honestly, I’m not entirely sure what’s normal anymore. It’s been… a little while.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these types of issues, Ms. Stepbro. You’re in a safe place, and we’ll take our time. “Down there” discomfort… that's a reasonable way to start. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discomfort a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. That's… reassuring. Well, it’s not exactly painful, all the time. More like… a heavy ache. Sometimes a dull throbbing. It comes and goes, really. And… It feels… swollen, perhaps? Though, again, I’m not certain. It’s… hard to tell. It's been going on for… well, a few weeks, I think. Maybe longer. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A heavy ache, dull throbbing, coming and going… and a sensation of swelling. A few weeks, potentially longer. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Stepbro. It’s helpful to have as much detail as possible, even if it feels vague. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically makes the discomfort worse?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I do a lot of… woodworking, you see. It’s my… profession. And I think… yes. Standing for long periods makes it worse. And… lifting things. Heavy wood, mostly. That definitely aggravates it. Sitting… sometimes helps, actually. Though, not always. And… I don’t recall anything specifically making it better, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Woodworking, prolonged standing and lifting aggravate the discomfort, while sitting provides some relief. Alright. That's very helpful, Ms. Stepbro. Now, have you noticed any other changes, besides the ache and swelling?
PATIENT: Other changes… Hmm. Well… I think… yes. Maybe. I’ve been… more tired lately. Just… generally fatigued. I thought it was just from working too hard, you see. But perhaps… it’s connected? And… I’ve also… noticed some… discharge. It’s not a lot, but… it’s there. I didn’t want to mention it, but you asked. It’s… clear, I think. Yes, clear.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Stepbro. It’s important information, and I appreciate your honesty. Fatigue and clear discharge… I understand it's not easy to discuss, and you've been very forthcoming. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I’ve not been to a doctor in… quite some time, you see. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. And… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. Perhaps fifteen, twenty years? It was… a complicated surgery, but I recovered. And… I’m on Medicare, if that’s relevant. I don’t recall anything else, honestly. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses, gallbladder removal fifteen to twenty years ago, and enrolled in Medicare. That’s helpful, Ms. Stepbro. And it's perfectly alright if you don’t recall everything. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication that I recall. I eat… most things. I’m not a particularly picky eater. And… I think… I had a bit of a rash once, after using a certain kind of wood stain. But it wasn’t a severe reaction. Just… a little itchy. So, I avoided that stain after that. I don’t think that counts as a true allergy, though. Nothing serious, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known significant allergies, with a mild reaction to a specific wood stain. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Vitamins… Oh dear. No, I don’t believe so. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I prefer… natural remedies, if I can. I take a multivitamin, occasionally. Just a basic one, for general health. And… Sometimes I take ibuprofen, for headaches. But that's it. Nothing regularly, at least. I don't have any prescriptions. Honestly, I haven’t needed to take anything consistently in… years. I'm not much of a medicine person.
DOCTOR: Occasional multivitamin and ibuprofen, otherwise no regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. My family… we don’t really talk about these things. It was… not encouraged, you see. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And… she died young, from a heart attack. Perhaps in her sixties. My father… he had… stomach problems, I think. But I don’t know the specifics. And… I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I don't know anything about his health. Honestly, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. It’s… a bit of a blank, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing what you know, Ms. Stepbro. It’s perfectly alright that the information is limited. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not at all. I’ve never been much of a smoker. Or a drinker, for that matter. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I’m far too busy with my woodworking to indulge in such things. I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a cup of tea and a good book. I take care of myself, you see. I eat healthy, I exercise when I can… Well, as much as my back allows these days. But I don't partake in any of those things. Not at all.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Stepbro. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you'd like to mention or any questions you have for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I suppose… I’m just worried, Doctor. It’s been… a while since I’ve felt this unwell. And I don’t like bothering people. I’m afraid I’m not very good at explaining these things. I just… want to feel better. And I hope… you can help me. I suppose I don’t really have any questions at this point. Just… a little anxious, I suppose. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Stepbro, and you're not bothering me at all. That's what I'm here for. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Based on what you've told me – the ache, the swelling, the fatigue, the discharge – we need to investigate further to determine the cause. It could be several things, and I don’t want to speculate without a proper examination. What I’d like to do now is a physical exam. I'll need to examine your abdomen and, with your permission, a genital exam to assess the area you're experiencing discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. I understand. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. I suppose… the sooner we know, the better. Just… be gentle, please. It’s… sensitive. And… perhaps you could explain what you’re doing as you go? It… helps to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepbro. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Okay, I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen. This will just help me get a baseline. Take a few deep breaths for me… good. Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. No significant tenderness to palpation. No masses detected. Now, to complete the exam, I’ll need to perform a genital exam. This will allow me to assess the testicles and surrounding tissues. I’ll use lubricant and gloves, and I’ll maintain your privacy as much as possible. Is that still alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that's alright. Just… be careful, please. And… explain what you're doing. It… helps. I’m ready. I think. Just… take your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepbro. I will take my time and explain everything as I go. I’m now going to gently examine your testicles, one at a time. I’ll be checking for size, shape, and any lumps or tenderness. I’ll also examine the epididymis, which is a tube at the back of the testicle. Okay, I’m starting with the right testicle… There is some mild tenderness to palpation on the upper pole… The size is within normal limits… No obvious masses detected… Now, moving to the left testicle… Again, some mild tenderness to palpation on the upper pole… Size is within normal limits… No obvious masses detected… The epididymis feels slightly enlarged on both sides, but not significantly… Inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged… Alright, Ms. Stepbro. That concludes the physical exam. I’ve noted some mild tenderness and slight enlargement of the epididymis on both sides. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect this could be epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Epididymitis… Yes, that sounds… less frightening than some other things. Tests… Yes, please. Anything to know for sure. What kind of tests? Will they be… painful? I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Stepbro. Epididymitis is often caused by a bacterial infection and is usually treatable with antibiotics. The tests I'd like to order are a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for infection, and a complete blood count to look for signs of inflammation. I’ll also order a test to rule out sexually transmitted infections, just to be thorough. The urine analysis is just a simple urine sample, and the urine culture involves sending a sample to the lab to see if any bacteria are present. The blood draw will involve a small needle prick, and may cause mild discomfort, but it's usually very quick. The STI test can be done with a urine sample as well. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I understand. Urine sample… blood draw… not ideal, but… necessary, I suppose. STI test… well, that’s a bit… unsettling. But, if it needs to be done… Will I need to come back for a separate appointment to get the blood drawn? And… when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stepbro. The STI test is just a precaution, and it's important to rule out all possibilities. We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic after this consultation. It will only take a few minutes. As for the results, the urine analysis results usually come back within an hour or so. The urine culture results take a few days, typically 24-48 hours, as it takes time to grow the bacteria in the lab. The STI test results will also take a few days, usually around 2-3 days. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and wearing supportive underwear to provide comfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that answers everything. Supportive underwear… and no strenuous activity. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. And patient. I appreciate it. So… the blood draw now? And then… we wait. Okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. I'm glad I could help. And yes, let's get the blood draw done now. It will be quick and relatively painless. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood. Once that's done, you can relax and I'll be in touch once the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns in the meantime.
