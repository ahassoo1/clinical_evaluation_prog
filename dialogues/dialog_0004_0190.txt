DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It’s not constant, but it’s… concerning. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been happening more frequently.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Unsteady on your feet,” you say. And it's been increasing in frequency. Alright. Can you describe what you mean by unsteady?
PATIENT: It’s… like I’m going to fall, sometimes. Not a full stumble, necessarily, but a loss of balance. It’s hard to describe. Like the ground is… shifting, perhaps? Or… like I’m a bit too tall for my own good, if that makes any sense. I work with… drills, you see, and need to be quite firm on my feet. It’s a bit worrying for that reason, mostly.
DOCTOR: "Like the ground is shifting," interesting. And you mentioned you work with drills… what kind of work is that, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Rotary drills. For oil and gas. I operate them, mostly. It's… a physical job, yes. Lots of… standing and maneuvering. It requires a good deal of… stability. And… focus. Though, lately, that’s been difficult with this… unsteadiness. I apologize, I'm not very good at explaining technical things. It's more hands-on work than… words.
DOCTOR: Right. "Hands-on work." So, this unsteadiness… does it happen more when you’re actively operating the drills, or is it present even when you’re not working?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think it’s worse when I’m at work. When I’m concentrating on the drills, and moving around. But… honestly, I’ve noticed it a few times just walking around the house, too. It’s just… more noticeable when I need to be steady, I suppose. I’m… not very good at keeping track of when it happens, if that makes sense. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: "Not very good at keeping track…" Alright. Let's try to be more specific. Have you experienced any dizziness with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. That is… a tricky one. Sometimes, yes, I think so. A sort of… lightheadedness, perhaps? Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… the room feels a bit… distant? But other times, it’s just the feeling of being off-balance, without any dizziness at all. It’s… difficult to pinpoint. I apologize for being so vague. It feels like a jumble, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: "A jumble…" Well, we'll try to untangle it. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this—changes in your vision, headaches, nausea, ringing in your ears, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it, yes. My vision has been a bit blurry at times, particularly towards the end of the day. And… I’ve had a few headaches, nothing severe, just a sort of dull ache. And… yes, I suppose there has been a slight ringing in my ears, intermittently. It’s not constant, and I hadn’t thought much of it. Everything feels… a bit disconnected lately, if that makes sense. It's like… a faint background noise.
DOCTOR: Right. Blurry vision, headaches, ringing in the ears… and this feeling of disconnection. Okay. Now, have you had any recent illnesses or injuries—even a minor cold or a bump to the head?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think. I… I believe I had a rather nasty cold a few months back. Perhaps… February? It knocked me off my feet for a week or so. And… yes, now that you mention it, I did bump my head rather awkwardly on a pipe at work a few weeks ago. It wasn't a hard bump, but it did sting for a bit. I didn't think much of it at the time, just a bit of a bruise. It didn't seem serious. I apologize, I often forget these sorts of things. It’s… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: “Often forget these sorts of things…” Alright. We’re getting somewhere. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… I… I believe I was told, some time ago, that my blood pressure was slightly elevated. But I don’t recall the specifics. It was… a long time ago. And no, I don't believe I have diabetes. My husband… my late husband… he was the one with health issues, not me. I apologize, my memory isn't very reliable when it comes to medical things. I mostly just went to the doctor when he needed to. I didn't pay much attention to my own health, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Slightly elevated blood pressure in the past. And you said your late husband had health issues… can you tell me about those?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. He… he had heart problems. Congestive heart failure, I believe it was. He… he was quite ill for a long time. It was… difficult. He was in and out of the hospital frequently. He also… he had some issues with his balance, towards the end. It wasn’t quite like my unsteadiness, more like… weakness. I… I apologize, it’s still difficult to talk about. It was… a long time ago, but the memories are still… vivid. He passed away… two years ago, in March. I’m… still adjusting, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. And do you have any other family members with similar issues—heart problems, balance difficulties, neurological conditions of any kind?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had some issues with her memory later in life. Not quite like dementia, but… forgetfulness, and some confusion. And… I believe my uncle, on my father’s side, had some sort of nerve condition. But I don’t recall the specifics. We weren’t very close, and my family… we didn’t discuss health issues openly. It was… a cultural thing, I suppose. It wasn't considered polite to ask about such things. I apologize, I'm not much help. I wish I could provide more information. It’s… frustrating, really, not being able to recall these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I don't smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. My late husband… he used to enjoy a drink now and then, but I’ve never been one for it. It… never appealed to me. I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a good book. I apologize, I'm not very exciting, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… just a multivitamin, I believe. And sometimes, if my headache is particularly bad, I take ibuprofen. Nothing else. I… I haven’t really needed much medication in the past. My late husband was the one with the pills, not me. I apologize, I'm not very good at remembering these things. I just take what the pharmacist suggests when I need something. It's… frustrating, really, not being able to recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don't believe so. As far as I'm aware, I'm not allergic to anything. I've never had a reaction to any medication or food. My late husband… he was allergic to penicillin, I believe. But I… I don't have any allergies myself. I apologize, I'm not very helpful when it comes to medical details. It's… frustrating, really, not being able to recall these things. I wish I could provide more information. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. We've covered a lot of ground. Given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, dizziness, blurry vision, headaches, ringing in your ears – and your history of a recent cold and a minor head bump, as well as the family history of heart problems and neurological issues, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Yes, a physical exam would be… helpful, I suppose. I’m… quite willing to do whatever you think is best. I apologize for being so vague, and for my poor memory. I just… want to understand what’s happening. Yes, please, proceed with the exam. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could follow me, please. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll assess your neurological function – balance, coordination, reflexes – and do a basic eye exam. Please sit here on the examination table. First, let’s take your blood pressure. I'll need you to relax your arm for a moment.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Relax, you say? Yes, I shall try. Though, I must admit, I’m always a bit nervous at the doctor’s office. Not that I’m afraid of needles, precisely… just… apprehensive, I suppose. Yes, please, proceed. I shall try to relax.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, Ms. Snerling, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Breath sounds are slightly diminished, but nothing concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s assess your balance. Could you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Slowly, you say? Yes, I can do that. Oh… a little unsteady, perhaps. But I’m standing. Yes, I'm standing. It's… a bit difficult, admittedly. But I'm attempting to remain upright. Is this what you wished to assess? My balance, you say? It feels… precarious, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Snerling, this is exactly what I wished to assess. It appears you do have some difficulty with balance, as you mentioned. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend your arms in front of you. This is called the Romberg test. Try to maintain this position for 30 seconds. Alright, you can open your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh… this is… difficult. Very difficult. Oh! That… that was rather unsettling. Yes, quite unsettling. It seems… my balance is considerably worse with my eyes closed. Is this… normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Ms. Snerling, but not necessarily alarming at this stage. The Romberg test indicates some impairment in your proprioception – your body's ability to sense its position in space. Now, I'd like to check your cranial nerves. This involves a few simple tests to assess your vision, eye movements, and facial sensation. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I shall attempt to follow your finger. This… this is a bit difficult. My vision… it's not quite as sharp as it used to be. Yes, I am following your finger, but it requires… considerable concentration. And my eyes… they feel rather tired. Yes, I am following. Is this… satisfactory, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears you have some mild nystagmus, which can contribute to dizziness and unsteadiness. Now, I'm going to check your hearing. Hearing appears normal in both ears. Now, to complete the exam, I'm going to palpate your sinuses and check your neck for any swelling or tenderness. No tenderness or swelling. Alright, Ms. Snerling, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That… that was thorough. Yes, quite thorough. I appreciate your diligence. Yes, I trust your assessment. Now… what do you think is causing my… unsteadiness, Doctor? And what can be done about it? Yes, I am anxious to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Based on your history and the physical exam findings – the elevated blood pressure, the mild nystagmus, the impairment in proprioception, and the recent cold and minor head injury – I suspect several possibilities. The mild nystagmus could indicate an inner ear issue, such as vestibular neuritis, which often follows a viral infection like the cold you had. The head injury could also be contributing, causing a mild concussion. The elevated blood pressure isn't significantly high, but it needs to be monitored. Given your symptoms and history, I'm also considering the possibility of early migraine associated vertigo, although further testing will be needed to confirm or exclude that. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection. Second, an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities and assess for any signs of concussion. And third, a vestibular function test to evaluate your inner ear balance system. We’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: MRI… and blood tests… yes, that sounds… rather extensive. Vestibular function test… I’m not familiar with that. And early migraine… I have never suffered from migraines, precisely. Though, I do occasionally experience headaches, as we discussed. So… you're not certain what is causing my unsteadiness? It’s… several possibilities, you say? And the tests will help determine which one is correct? And… will these tests be painful, Doctor? I'm… not particularly fond of needles, or… enclosed spaces.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Ms. Snerling. At this stage, we don't have a definitive answer. That’s why the tests are important. They will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of treatment. Regarding your concerns, the blood tests are relatively straightforward – a small amount of blood drawn from your arm. As for the MRI, it is a painless procedure. You will lie inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It can be a bit noisy and you will need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes, but it is not harmful. It can be claustrophobic for some people, but we can provide anti-anxiety medication if needed, or even an open MRI if you are particularly anxious. The vestibular function test involves wearing goggles and having sensors placed on your face while you perform some simple movements. It’s not painful, but it can sometimes cause dizziness, so it’s performed under the supervision of a trained technician. I will write you a referral for these tests and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate your dizziness, and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Anti-anxiety medication… yes, that is… reassuring. And an open MRI… that sounds… preferable, if possible. Yes, I believe I would prefer that. So… avoiding activities that exacerbate my dizziness… and rest. Yes, I can manage that. Is there… anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Any specific foods I should avoid? Any exercises I should not be doing? And… is it safe to drive? I… I need to go to the grocery store, and… well, I don't want to risk endangering anyone.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Snerling. Regarding diet, there's no specific food to avoid at this time. However, staying well-hydrated is always important, as dehydration can worsen dizziness. As for exercise, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity or anything that requires a lot of balance – swimming, cycling, heavy lifting – until we have a better understanding of what's causing your dizziness. Regarding driving… that's a bit more complicated. Given your symptoms, I advise against driving until we have a clearer diagnosis and you’ve had a chance to assess your tolerance. It's better to err on the side of caution and avoid putting yourself or others at risk. I can write you a temporary note excusing you from driving if needed. I will also write a referral to a physical therapist specializing in vestibular rehabilitation. Even if the tests come back negative, physical therapy can help improve your balance and coordination. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… yes, that sounds… sensible. And a note excusing me from driving… yes, please, that would be very helpful. I appreciate your thoughtfulness, Doctor. I believe… I believe that is all for now. I am… rather overwhelmed, to be honest. But… I appreciate your patience, and your thoroughness. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I shall… I shall schedule the tests, and the physical therapy appointment. And… I shall avoid driving, and strenuous activity. Yes, I shall. Thank you, Doctor Deschane. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. Remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and please rest. I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
