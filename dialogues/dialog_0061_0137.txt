DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Lindra. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My husband… he think I need… how you say… okay for old people place? Senior living? He make appointment. I no feel sick, but he worry.
DOCTOR: “Bula vinaka to you as well, Lindra. It sounds like your husband is concerned about you potentially moving to a senior living community. That’s very thoughtful of him. It’s good he’s looking out for you. So, just to clarify, you aren’t feeling unwell, but he's noticed some changes and wants to get my opinion?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. He say I… forget things sometimes. Not big things, but… where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. Little things. He say it’s getting more. I think he worry too much. But he want me check. Is okay, I come.
DOCTOR: “Okay, I understand. It’s common for little things to slip our minds as we get older, and it’s good your husband is proactive about getting things checked out. It’s always best to rule things out. So, these memory lapses… when did you first start noticing them?
PATIENT: Hmm… is hard to say. Maybe… six months ago? A little before that. Not every day. Sometimes days go by and I remember everything. Other days… I have to ask my husband. He no get mad, he just… look at me with worry face. He cook good food, you know. Is good husband. But he worry too much!
DOCTOR: “He sounds like a very caring husband, Lindra. It's good he's supportive. Six months ago is helpful to know. And it’s good that it isn’t happening every day. Now, besides the memory slips, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… I get tired easier, maybe. Before, I could work all day at the bar, no problem. Now, sometimes after a few hours, I need to sit down. And… my hands shake a little bit. Not all the time, but when I pour drinks sometimes. Is scary to me, to be honest. I no want to spill on customers!
DOCTOR: “I understand that’s concerning, Lindra. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Fatigue and hand tremors are things we definitely want to look into. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep is… okay. I sleep good, usually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but is not so bad. Just get up, go to the bathroom. Mood… I feel sad sometimes, but who no feel sad? Is life, you know? I try to be happy. My husband tell me jokes, he is funny man. I think I am okay. Just getting old, maybe. Is that all?
DOCTOR: “That’s good to hear you’re sleeping alright and that your husband keeps your spirits up! It’s completely normal to feel down sometimes, especially with life’s challenges. We'll definitely explore what's going on. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doctor say I have… the pressure. High blood pressure, yes. A long time ago. I take the little white pills for it. Every morning. And… I had a problem with my heart, many years ago. But doctor fix it. I take pills for that too. Not every day now. Just sometimes, when I feel… funny. Is that all you need to know? I forget the names of the pills, sorry!
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Lindra, don’t worry about remembering the names. We have your records here, so we can look those up. So, you have a history of high blood pressure and a heart condition, both managed with medication. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, one surgery. A long time ago. For my… tummy. Is bad, but doctor fix it. I was very sick. Had to stay in hospital for many days. But I feel good now. No problem with tummy anymore. Is long, long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? I no remember very good. Sorry.
DOCTOR: “No need to apologize, Lindra. Twenty years ago is a long time. Okay, so surgery on your abdomen many years ago. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had… the sugar. Diabetes, yes. She was sick for many years. And my father… he forget things at the end. Very bad. He no know who we were sometimes. Is sad. My sister, she have the heart problems too. But I no know much about it. Is long ago, we no talk much now.
DOCTOR: “Thank you for sharing that, Lindra. That’s helpful to know about your family history. It sounds like there’s a tendency towards diabetes, heart problems, and some memory issues in your family. Now, just a few more questions. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. I no smoke. Never. And no drugs, never. I drink… sometimes a little wine with dinner. Is red wine, good for the heart, my husband say. Not every day, just… special occasions. And I used to drink at work, of course! But I no drink so much anymore. Is bad for me now, I think.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so occasional red wine. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the ones we've already discussed for your blood pressure and heart?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes. I take a little pill for my… bones. The doctor say I have weak bones. Is for old people. I take it every morning with my other pills. And… sometimes I take something for my… pain. When my knees hurt. But not every day, just when I walk too much. Is that all? I think that is all. My purse is full of pills! Sorry, doctor.
DOCTOR: “That’s alright, Lindra, many people take multiple medications. So, a pill for osteoporosis, to strengthen your bones, and something for knee pain as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. I like all the foods. No problems with pills either. I take so many, I would know if I was allergic! No, no allergies. I am good. Is good, yes? No problems with allergies.
DOCTOR: “That’s excellent, Lindra. No allergies is very good to know. Okay, so let’s do a quick physical exam now. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few simple tests to assess your balance and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is okay. You do what you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I hope is not too bad. I no like doctors very much, but you are nice.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Lindra. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, but nothing too concerning at this point. Your lungs sound good. Now, when I ask you to stand up, I want you to do so slowly. How do you feel?
PATIENT: I feel… a little dizzy. Not so bad, but… whoosh. Like the room is moving. I hold on to the chair, you see? Is normal, doctor? I get dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. Maybe is old age?
DOCTOR: “It’s good you told me, Lindra. A little dizziness when standing up can be common, but we need to investigate why it's happening. It could be due to a number of things, including your blood pressure medication, dehydration, or something else. Now, I’d like to order a few blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your blood sugar, kidney function, thyroid levels, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. We’ll also do an EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is okay. Do what you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Is going to be much blood? I no like needles very much… but I do what you say.
DOCTOR: “We’ll only need a small amount of blood, Lindra, just a few vials. It will be a quick pinch, and our phlebotomist is very skilled. And you’re right, it’s important to do what’s necessary to figure out what’s going on. While we wait for the lab results, let’s talk about some things you can do at home. It's important to stay well-hydrated, so aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day. Avoid standing up too quickly, and if you do feel dizzy, sit down immediately. And try to get regular, gentle exercise, like walking, if you're able. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… is much water! But I try. And no standing up too fast… I remember. Is hard to remember everything, you know? Um… about the old people place… the senior living… You think I need it? Is my brain bad? Am I getting… sick?
DOCTOR: “Those are very important questions, Lindra, and it’s good you’re asking them. It’s completely normal to be concerned about changes in your memory, and it doesn’t automatically mean you need to move to a senior living community. We need to figure out why you’re experiencing these lapses first. There are many possible causes, and not all of them are serious. Right now, it’s too early to say whether you need to move to a senior living facility. We need to get the lab results back and see what they tell us. We'll also talk about your overall lifestyle and see if there are any simple changes we can make to improve your memory and well-being. We'll rule out any potential medical causes first. Then, if necessary, we can discuss other options. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay… You think maybe is just… old age? And I need more water? Is good to hear you say that. My husband… he worry too much. He always worry. Is good to have a doctor who no scare me. Thank you, Doctor. Is very kind.
DOCTOR: “That’s very understandable, Lindra. It could very well be just normal age-related changes, and staying hydrated is always a good idea! And I’m glad I could reassure you. My goal is to help you feel your best, and that includes addressing your concerns and providing you with honest and clear information. We’ll get these lab results back as quickly as possible. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you again, Doctor. You are very good doctor. And please… tell my husband no to worry so much! I think… I think I am okay. For now.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Lindra. I’ll do my best to reassure your husband when I have the chance. And you’re right, you seem to be doing okay for now. We'll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
