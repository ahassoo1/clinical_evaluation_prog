DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Carlotta is right. Yes... my wife and I... we thinking about... a baby. Maybe. It's been a long time, you see. Long, long time. We want to make sure... everything is okay first. I don't remember much about... things like this, though. Old man problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… certainly a decision. While I specialize in internal medicine, and your concern is… reproductive health, let’s gather some information. It’s good you’re thinking proactively. First, just to clarify, you and your wife are considering attempting to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s right. Trying. Maybe. We haven't... started yet, exactly. Just talking. And... checking. I want to be sure I can... you know... be a father. If it is meant to be. It's a big thing, a baby. Is that… okay? I hope I am not bothering you with old man questions.
DOCTOR: It’s not a matter of “bothering” me, Mr. Carlotta. It's simply outside my area of expertise. However, we can certainly discuss your overall health to ensure you're in the best possible condition should you and your wife decide to proceed. Let's start with your medical history. Have you seen a physician regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. That’s a hard one. I had a doctor… back in… Mogadishu, I think. A long, long time ago. Here? Not so much. Medicare takes care of some things, but… mostly just when something really breaks. I make things with my hands, you see. Metal and plastic. Sometimes I cut myself, little things. But nothing serious. I haven’t been sick, not really, in… many years. Does that make sense? I forget dates, Doctor. Everything is… blurry.
DOCTOR: So, limited recent medical care, and a history of minor injuries related to your work. That’s helpful. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just… something for my knee. It aches sometimes, when the weather is bad. The little blue pill. I don’t remember the name. My wife gets it for me. And sometimes, a pain reliever for my back, when I’ve been bending a lot. The white ones. That's it, I think. Nothing else. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel… strange. Fuzzy-headed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife says I get a little itchy sometimes after eating shellfish, but she says it’s just old age. And dust, maybe. I sneeze a lot when cleaning the workshop. But nothing… serious. Never been to the hospital for allergies. I have always been a strong man. A tough man. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Right. And, Mr. Carlotta, just to be thorough, can you tell me about any past surgeries or serious illnesses you've had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had my appendix out. A long, long time ago. That’s all I remember. And… maybe a broken arm, when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But it healed well. Serious illnesses… I had a fever once, a bad one. But it passed. Nothing… lasting. My wife says I had some trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been… okay lately. I think. Is this important? All these questions… are you finding something wrong?
DOCTOR: It's important to have a complete picture, Mr. Carlotta. Your history is… somewhat sparse, which makes a thorough evaluation more challenging. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That is hard. My parents… they are gone now, a long time ago. I had many brothers and sisters, but we haven’t seen each other in… decades. Somalia was… difficult. I don't know much about their health. My wife’s family… she says her mother had trouble with her heart, but I don't know the details. She died many years ago, too. It's hard to remember. It's been so long. Everyone is… gone. Does it matter? If I don’t know, can we still… try?
DOCTOR: While it’s not impossible to proceed without a detailed family history, it does limit our ability to assess potential risks. Now, I need to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My wife doesn't allow it. Bad for the health, she says. Alcohol… sometimes, a small glass of wine with dinner. Just on special occasions. Recreational drugs? No, never. I am a working man. I need my hands steady. No, no. A good, clean life. Mostly. Just the aches and pains of getting old. That's enough trouble, I think. So, are we getting anywhere? Can we… think about a baby?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your desire to explore this possibility. However, given your limited medical history and lack of recent care, I can’t offer a definitive assessment of your suitability for fatherhood at this time. I need to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of your overall health. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical… yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, I will do it. I just… want to know if it’s possible. If my old body can still… do what it needs to do. But please, be gentle. I am not a young man anymore. And don’t be surprised if I ask you to repeat things. My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but breathing is somewhat labored. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen to check for any abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Now, I am going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I am trying to relax, but… it's hard when I don't know what you are looking for. Ah, that's a little sore. Old injury, maybe? From the workshop. I bend a lot, you see. Metal and plastic… it's hard on the body. And the bending… it's always on this side, the left. Is that bad? The soreness? I am a stubborn man. I work through the pain. Usually.
DOCTOR: The soreness is noted, Mr. Carlotta. It could be related to your work, or it could be indicative of something else. We will need further investigation to determine the cause. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are somewhat diminished, but still within acceptable limits. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Based on my preliminary examination, there are a few areas of concern that require further investigation. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, there is a slight murmur in your heart, and your reflexes are diminished. The soreness in your abdomen also warrants further evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn't sound good, does it? I knew I was an old man. What does that mean? What kind of investigation? More poking and prodding? And what if… what if it's something bad? Will I be able to… work? Will I be able to… be a father? Please, tell me the truth. Even if it's not what I want to hear. I am a stubborn man, but I need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your concerns. It’s important to be realistic, but also not to jump to conclusions. These findings do require further investigation, but they don’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. I recommend the following: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function, and an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the source of your pain. I also recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation of your heart murmur. As for your ability to work or be a father, we need to determine the underlying cause of these findings before we can answer those questions. I will provide you with a list of laboratories and imaging centers in the area. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss your options and develop a plan of action. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Tests… so many tests. A cardiologist… that sounds serious. And how long will that take? All this… waiting. It's hard for an old man to wait. What if… what if it's something really bad? Something that… stops everything? I suppose I should be thankful you are looking into it. But it's a lot to take in. A list… yes, a list would be good. And… can you explain what these tests are for? In simple words? My memory… it's not what it used to be. I just want to know if I can… give my wife a little happiness. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let me explain the tests in simpler terms. The complete blood count checks for any abnormalities in your blood cells. The comprehensive metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, and checks your blood sugar levels. The electrocardiogram records the electrical activity of your heart, to identify any irregularities. The abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of your abdominal organs, to identify the source of your pain. This document provides more detailed information about each test. The results should be available within a few days to a week. As for the cardiologist referral, I will submit the request today. You should receive a call within the next week to schedule an appointment. I understand your desire to give your wife happiness. We will do everything we can to determine the underlying cause of these findings and develop a plan of action. It's important to remember that these tests are simply a preliminary step. We will discuss the results thoroughly and make a decision based on those findings. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm. Lots of big words. I’ll need my wife to read this for me. She’s much better with… paperwork. So, you're not saying it's definitely bad? You're just… checking? That’s good. A little bit of checking is better than… everything being over before it begins. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For not… scaring me too much. And for trying to help an old man. I guess I'll go home now and… tell my wife. She'll know what to do. She always does. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. Please let your wife know to call my office if she has any questions. And don’t hesitate to contact me if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. I wish you and your wife all the best. .
