DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Kilton, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Fourney. Now, you’re 76, if I’m reading this chart correctly. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Seventy-six years. It is nice to meet you Doctor Fourney. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I try to take a deep breath. It worries me some.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… a kettle, almost. But inside my chest. It happens mostly when I walk, or if I try to do too much. I used to be very active, you see. I was an athletic trainer for many years. But now… even small things make it hard to breathe.
DOCTOR: An athletic trainer, impressive. Alright, so it’s exertion-related, mostly. And a whistling sound… that gives us something to work with. How long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It has been… a few months now, I think. At first, it was just now and then. I thought it was just my age, you know? But it has gotten worse. Maybe… three months? It is hard to remember exactly. Everything feels a little blurry lately.
DOCTOR: Blurry, alright. We'll try to get things a bit clearer here. Has anything, specifically, made it worse in the last three months?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. The heat, I think. This summer has been very warm, yes? And…dust. My daughter, she comes to visit, and we do a little gardening. The dust from the plants makes it harder, I believe. Also, I was visiting my sister last month, and her house… many cats. The cat hair, I think it bothered my breathing.
DOCTOR: Right, heat, dust, and cat dander. You're giving me a good list, Mrs. Kilton. So, it sounds like it’s aggravated by environmental factors. Do you notice any other symptoms when you’re short of breath?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes… my chest feels tight. Like a heavy weight on it. And… I get tired very easily. Even walking to the kitchen makes me need to sit down. And a little… a little worried feeling, if I think about it too much. It is a bit frightening when you can't catch your breath.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tightness, fatigue, and a little anxiety with it. Have you had a cough at all, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: A cough? Not really… not a big one. Just a little tickle in my throat sometimes. Mostly in the mornings. Nothing that keeps me up at night, or anything. Just a small cough. Is that important, Doctor? I do not want to bother you with small things.
DOCTOR: It’s never a small thing if it's bothering you, Mrs. Kilton. And a cough can be important. Is the cough productive?
PATIENT: Productive? I… I do not know what that means, Doctor. Does that mean… do I cough up anything? Sometimes, a little bit of… phlegm, maybe? It is clear, usually. Not much. I am sorry, I do not understand all these words. I just feel tired and…wheezy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Don't apologize, Mrs. Kilton. We'll take it slow. A little clear phlegm when you cough. Good. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had the flu, many years ago. And…my blood pressure was high, once. The doctor gave me a pill for it, and it went down. But…nothing else, really. I have always been healthy, mostly. I walked every day, for years. And I ate my vegetables! Until this breathing trouble, I was very strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in the past, managed with medication. Good. And no other major illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I remember, or that they told me about. Just the usual old age aches and pains, you know? My knees bother me sometimes, and my back… but that is just getting old, I think. Is there something… serious, Doctor? I am getting a little worried now. My daughter says I should come to the doctor, but I do not like to worry people.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Kilton, worrying is part of my job. And frankly, at your age, it’s always best to rule things out. Now, have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never. My mother, she smoked, and it was terrible. She had a very bad cough, and…well, I always stayed away from it. No, never smoked. Not even a puff. I always told my students to stay away from it too, as an athletic trainer. It is bad for your lungs, you see.
DOCTOR: Good. Very good. Alright. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I do sneeze sometimes, in the spring. When the flowers bloom, you know? And… I think dust makes me sneeze too. But not a terrible allergy. Just a little bit of sneezing. My daughter has terrible allergies, though. She is always taking medicine for them. I am lucky, mostly. I do not get sick very often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Seasonal allergies, dust. Now, are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure. It is very small, and I take it every morning. And…sometimes, a little pain reliever for my knees, if they bother me. But not every day. Just when they are very sore. Is that okay, Doctor? I always tell my doctor what I take, you know. I do not want to mix anything up.
DOCTOR: Good, good. It sounds like you are quite conscientious about your health, Mrs. Kilton, despite everything. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs, if that’s alright. And then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Just a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Listen to my lungs, you said? That is good. I am glad you are listening. I hope you can find out what is wrong. Please, be gentle. My chest feels a little… fragile, you know? I will try to breathe deeply, if you tell me to. Just take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Another one… that’s it. Hmm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terrible. Pulse is normal. Alright. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, Mrs. Kilton. That correlates with your symptoms. It sounds like you might have some mild asthma, or possibly COPD, but we need to do some further testing to confirm.
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? Those sound…serious, Doctor. I have never been told I had anything like that. Is that… from the dust? Or the heat? What does that mean, Doctor? I do not understand. Will I have to take pills forever? I am a bit frightened now, you see. Is it something…catchable? Will my daughter be worried?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, please try to remain calm. Asthma and COPD are common conditions, especially in older adults. It doesn't mean you are gravely ill. They are manageable conditions. Asthma is inflammation of the airways, often triggered by allergens like dust or pollen. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is often related to smoking, though you don't have that risk factor, it can sometimes develop with long-term exposure to irritants. It’s not “catchable”, no. Your daughter will not be at risk. As for medication, it might be necessary. We'll need to do a spirometry test – a breathing test – to assess the function of your lungs. Then, we can determine the best course of action. We'll start with a bronchodilator inhaler to open up your airways and see if that provides relief. If that helps, we can discuss long-term management options. Do you understand so far?
PATIENT: A breathing test… and an inhaler… Yes, I think I understand. It is… a little bit scary, but I am glad you are explaining it to me. A bronchodilator… that will open up my airways? Will it make me feel better right away? And you said I might need medication…for a long time? Is it…expensive? My insurance is private, but still… I do not want to be a burden to my daughter. She helps me with so much already. I am just a little worried about all of it, you see.
DOCTOR: The breathing test is simple, Mrs. Kilton. You just blow into a tube. It doesn't hurt. And the bronchodilator inhaler often provides relief quite quickly. Within minutes, you should feel less wheezing and shortness of breath. As for the medication, it depends. Some people require long-term treatment, while others only need it occasionally, during flare-ups. We'll assess your condition and determine the most appropriate course of action. Regarding the cost, let’s leave that for now. I'll have my nurse check your insurance coverage and provide you with an estimate. We'll find a solution that works for you. Don't worry about being a burden. That's what we're here for. Now, I'm going to order the spirometry test and a chest X-ray. The X-ray will help rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray too… Yes. That sounds like a lot. But… I trust you, Doctor. You seem very knowledgeable. Will the X-ray…show if my lungs are damaged? And if they are… can they get better? And… what if it is not asthma? What else could it be? My daughter, she worries about everything. She will want to know all of the possibilities. I do not want to scare her needlessly. Just… tell me plainly, Doctor. What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, it’s good that you're asking questions. But frankly, you’re getting ahead of yourself. We haven't even done the tests yet. The X-ray will help us rule out things like pneumonia, heart failure, or a lung tumor. It’s a precaution. As for what if it’s not asthma, there are several possibilities. It could be chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or even a reaction to an irritant. But it’s too early to speculate. And your daughter...well, I understand her concern. But let’s get the test results first. We don't need to cause unnecessary anxiety. I'll explain everything to you once we have a clearer picture. We’ll take it one step at a time, alright?
PATIENT: Yes. One step at a time. That sounds…better. I do not want to worry my daughter needlessly. She has enough on her plate. So…the breathing test and the X-ray…and then we talk? Where will I do the breathing test? And… will I need an appointment? I do not like to wait too long. My knees bother me when I sit for a long time. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. I do apologize for asking so many questions. It is just… I want to understand.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mrs. Kilton. It’s my job. The breathing test is done right here in the clinic. My nurse, Susan, will schedule you for it before you leave. It usually takes about fifteen minutes. And the X-ray is done across the hall. They'll call you if there's a wait. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of prednisone to help reduce the inflammation in your airways. Take this with food. Now, do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Prednisone… is that a steroid, Doctor? I have heard those can have side effects. And… will it interact with my blood pressure medicine? I always worry about mixing things up. My daughter says I should keep a list of all my medications, which I do. And… if I feel worse after taking the prednisone… what should I do? Should I call you? Or go to the emergency room? I am just trying to be prepared. It is better to be safe than sorry, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, prednisone is a steroid. It can have side effects, but a short course like this is generally well-tolerated. Common side effects include increased appetite, difficulty sleeping, and a slightly elevated blood sugar. As for interaction with your blood pressure medication, it’s unlikely, but it's always best to be cautious. I’ll put a note in your chart and Susan will review it with you. If you feel worse after taking the prednisone – say, if you develop severe nausea, vomiting, or chest pain – then absolutely call my office immediately. If it's after hours and you’re experiencing severe symptoms, then go to the emergency room. Now, are we quite finished?
PATIENT: Yes. I think we are. You have answered all of my questions, Doctor. And you have been very patient with me, even when I asked too many. I appreciate that. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little bit better now, just knowing what we are looking for. I will schedule the tests with Susan, and I will be sure to call if I have any problems. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. You have a good day now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Susan will take good care of you. Have a good day as well, Mrs. Kilton. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
