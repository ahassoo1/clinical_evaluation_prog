DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Ronnald Limtiaco. Though, everyone just calls me Ron. It's… good to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, was it? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Though frankly, what is everyone’s name these days?
PATIENT: Heh. Tell me about it. I struggle with names myself. I’m here… well, my wife mostly set this up. Something about papers? For… time off? I’m with the church, you see. Directors, Religious Activities and Education… that’s what they call it. It’s a bit fuzzy what exactly she needs me to get from you, though. She handles most of the… official bits.
DOCTOR: “Papers for time off”?
PATIENT: Right. That sounds about right. Something to do with… needing a bit of time away. I’ve been… not feeling quite myself lately. Tired, mostly. And a little… confused, if I'm honest. Not a big deal, I don’t think. But my wife, bless her heart, she worries. She said something about FMLA or… disability? Does that ring a bell? I really don’t follow these things.
DOCTOR: So, you're experiencing fatigue and some confusion… and your wife is concerned about possible leave from your… religious work. How long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think… It’s been… a while. Several months, at least. Maybe longer? It comes and goes, you see. Some days I feel alright, pretty normal. Other days… well, other days I just want to sit down. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. My wife probably has a better idea. She keeps a calendar, you know. I just… go with the flow. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A calendar would be… helpful, yes. And is this fatigue interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. It makes it hard to… concentrate, mostly. Leading services, that requires a lot of focus, you know? And the education stuff… remembering names, dates, all that. It’s getting tricky. I find myself… stumbling over things more and more. My wife has started helping me with the lesson plans. She’s a lifesaver, really. It’s embarrassing, to be honest, but she says it’s alright. Says everyone gets a little forgetful as they get older. Is that… what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Hmm. Let me think. My wife says I’ve been… quieter. More withdrawn, she called it. I don’t feel different, exactly. Just… less inclined to chat, I suppose. And… I’ve been sleeping more. Even during the day sometimes. Just a little nap, mind you. But more than usual. Oh, and… I think my appetite has been a little off. Not much of an appetite, that is. Everything tastes… bland, somehow. Does that make sense? I’m not sure what all this means, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any… difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: Balance… now that you mention it… I have felt a little unsteady on my feet a couple of times. Nothing major, just a little wobbly. I thought it was just my age, you know? Old knees acting up. I haven’t fallen or anything, thankfully. But… yes, I suppose I have noticed that. It's fleeting, though. Doesn't happen often. Is that… worrying? My wife will be very concerned if it is. She’s always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Let's just do a few quick tests. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I hope I’m not making a mess of things. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be either, you see. It’s all going, bit by bit. I'm getting to the age where everything seems to be… fading.
DOCTOR: Okay, just walk normally across the room, please. And try not to stumble.
PATIENT: There… I think that went alright. A little wobbly, maybe? It's hard to tell. These floors are so… shiny. Makes me a bit dizzy, to be honest. I really should get my eyes checked, shouldn't I? My wife has been telling me that for months.
DOCTOR: Well, based on this brief assessment, and given your wife’s concerns… it’s difficult to say definitively. We need some further testing. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. Also, I think a brain scan would be prudent. An MRI, ideally. And I’m referring you to a neurologist. They can conduct a more thorough evaluation. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of tests. My wife will be… relieved, I suppose. But I’m not a fan of hospitals, you see. Too many… beeping noises. Allergies? Let me think… No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty good, constitution-wise. Maybe a little sensitive to shellfish, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I don’t take any medications regularly either, if that’s helpful. Just… a little something for my knees when they act up, but that’s all. When would I… when would I need to do these tests?
DOCTOR: Here are the lab requisitions. You can get these done at any Quest Diagnostics location. As for the MRI… the neurology office will schedule that for you. They’re located at 123 Main Street. The number is on the referral sheet. And yes, I know it’s a lot. But it’s best to rule things out. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… right. I think I know where that is. My wife usually handles all this, you see. I get… flustered easily. Questions… Hmm. Well… what are we looking for, exactly? Is it something… serious? My wife didn’t say anything, but… I can tell she’s worried. Is it my memory? Is that what these tests are for?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it's impossible to say definitively without the results of the tests. We’re assessing for a range of possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and neurological conditions. It could be related to your memory issues, or it could be something entirely different. Frankly, fatigue and confusion can have numerous causes. I’m ordering these tests to get a clearer picture. I’m not going to speculate without concrete data. Do not self-diagnose. And please, let your wife handle the scheduling. It will be far less stressful for everyone involved. Are there any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very thorough, if nothing else. I suppose that’s a good thing. I’ll… let my wife handle everything. She always does. I just hope… I hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. The nurse will escort you to the checkout. Have a good day. .
