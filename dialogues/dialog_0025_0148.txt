DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepno. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having some pain… down there. It's in… my groin, I suppose? It’s difficult to explain, and truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I hope you don’t mind my being a little… vague.
DOCTOR: Embarrassment is perfectly normal when discussing these things, Ms. Stepno. Don’t worry about being vague; we'll get to the bottom of it. "Down there" and "groin pain" are a good start. Now, can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, I think. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times… it’s quite uncomfortable. It seems to be worse after I’ve been… working. You know, with the wood. But I can’t be entirely certain. It’s all a bit… hazy. Is that helpful? I apologize for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Stepno. Though “hazy” isn’t exactly a medical term, I appreciate you trying to articulate it. You mentioned working with wood – are you involved in any strenuous physical activity?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I… I make things. Furniture, mostly. Little tables, chairs… sometimes bigger pieces if I’m feeling ambitious. It keeps me busy, you know? And it… it requires a bit of lifting, and bending, and… well, a lot of physical effort. I’ve been doing it for… a long time. I honestly can’t recall exactly how long. Is that relevant? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Stepno. Lifting and bending, especially repetitive movements, can certainly contribute to pain in that area. Now, has this pain been increasing gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. I believe… gradually. It wasn’t a sudden shock, if that makes sense. It just… slowly became more noticeable. A little ache here and there, and then… more frequent, and… more bothersome. Honestly, I’ve been trying to ignore it, hoping it would just go away on its own. Perhaps that wasn’t the wisest course of action.
DOCTOR: Ignoring pain rarely makes it disappear, Ms. Stepno. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give this pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A number… Hmm… at its worst… I suppose… a six? Maybe a seven on a bad day. It’s not debilitating, I can still function, but it’s certainly… distracting. And uncomfortable, of course. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, does it? I don’t think so… just right there. I’m afraid I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: A six or seven is significant, Ms. Stepno. And staying localized is good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No fever, I don't believe. And no nausea. Hmm… I have been a little more tired than usual, but I just assumed that was… old age. And perhaps… a little bit of swelling, maybe? It’s hard to say for certain. I haven't really… examined myself closely, if you understand what I mean. It's… a delicate area. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and possible swelling are worth noting, Ms. Stepno. Don’t apologize – it’s perfectly understandable. Now, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That’s… a personal question, Doctor. I… I am single, as you know. And… not currently. It’s been… a long time. But… yes, I was, in the past. I hope that answers your question adequately. Is that… relevant to the pain?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Stepno. It helps to understand your overall health history. Now, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I haven’t taken many medications in my life, truthfully. Just… the occasional pain reliever for headaches. And I don’t recall any reactions. I did have a… a rash once, many years ago, after using a new soap, but I didn’t think that was an allergy, just… sensitive skin. Is there a particular medication you’re concerned about? I apologize for being so vague. I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stepno. We'll piece things together. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis in my hands, when it flares up. But it's not a regular thing. Just when I really need it. And… sometimes a little bit of chamomile tea, if I’m having trouble sleeping. Does that count? I apologize for rambling. I feel like I'm just… listing things at random.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea doesn't count, Ms. Stepno. Ibuprofen is good to know. And no other supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Hmm… Oh! Well, my neighbor, Elena, she gave me some… some cream for my hands. She said it was made with all-natural ingredients, something from the rainforest. It smelled very nice, like flowers. I’ve only used it a couple of times, though. I wasn’t sure if it was helping much, so I stopped. I don’t even remember what she called it. Is that important? I apologize. My mind is like a sieve these days.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Ms. Stepno. “All-natural” doesn't necessarily mean safe. Okay, let’s move on. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had something with his heart, many years ago. As for me… the doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high a few years back, but he said I could manage it with diet. And… I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, as I mentioned. That’s why I take the ibuprofen sometimes. Nothing else, I think. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. My memory… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Stepno. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils removed. That’s the only surgery I can recall. And… I was in the hospital once, many years ago, when I had a very bad flu. But that was just for a couple of days. Nothing else, I think. I apologize. My memory is like a… a broken record. It keeps skipping around.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My mother passed away many years ago. And my father… he died even longer ago. It was… a long time ago. I don’t like to dwell on it. I’m sorry. Is it important to know how they died? I apologize for being so… emotional. This is bringing back a lot of memories.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stepno. Don’t apologize. It's perfectly normal to feel emotional. Knowing their medical history can be helpful. If you're comfortable sharing, did either of your parents have any significant medical problems, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes… my mother, she had… she had heart problems, towards the end. She was very frail. And… my father, he had cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. He smoked for many years. It was… a difficult time. I'm sorry. Is that helpful? I apologize. I feel like I'm just… unloading everything. It's been a long time since I've talked about this.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Stepno. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine on special occasions. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a very… respectable woman. I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a good book. Is that helpful? I apologize. I feel like I'm rambling again. It's just… I'm not used to talking about these things.
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. Stepno. Now, tell me about your work. You mentioned working with wood. How physically demanding is it, on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, it varies. Some days are easier than others. Mostly, it’s a lot of lifting, bending, sawing… you know. I lift heavy pieces of wood, sometimes. And I'm on my feet a lot. It can be quite tiring, especially in the summer, when it’s hot and humid. And occasionally, I cut myself, nothing serious, just little scrapes and bruises. But lately… it feels more strenuous than usual. It's harder to get up in the morning, and my muscles ache more. Is that helpful? I apologize. I feel like I'm just describing my daily routine.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Stepno. It paints a picture. Now, finally, before we move on to an exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don’t think so. I’ve told you everything I can remember, which… isn't much, I'm afraid. Except… sometimes, I have a little bit of trouble sleeping. And… I’ve been feeling a little bit more anxious lately, but I just assumed that was… age. Is that helpful? I apologize. I truly wish I could be more informative. It's just… my memory… it's like a sieve, as I mentioned before. I’m afraid I’m not very good at this. Is an exam a good idea? I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: An exam is a very good idea, Ms. Stepno. And it’s perfectly alright that your memory isn’t what it used to be. We’ll take things slowly. Let’s start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll do a physical examination. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly agreeable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your expertise completely. Thank you for being so patient with me. And… thank you for listening. I feel… a little bit relieved, just having talked about it. Please, just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepno. If you'll just have a seat on the table here. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Now, I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just relax, and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale… good. And again… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. Now, I'm going to examine the groin area. I’ll need you to bend your knees and relax your muscles. I'll be quick and gentle.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm… a little bit self-conscious about this, if you don’t mind. But I understand it's necessary. Please… just be gentle. And… let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm… trying to relax, but it's difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepno. I'm feeling for any lumps or tenderness. There's a slight bulge on the left side, but it's not particularly painful to the touch. No significant tenderness or inflammation. I'm also checking your range of motion in your hips… can you lift your leg up like this?
PATIENT: Ouch… that’s a little bit uncomfortable, Doctor. Not terribly painful, but… definitely noticeable. It’s a bit stiff, I suppose. I don’t usually move my legs like that. Is that… normal? I apologize for being such a difficult patient. I’m afraid I’m not very flexible.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Stepno. It's good you're telling me what you're feeling. Reduced range of motion and slight discomfort are worth noting. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems… within normal limits, but the bulge and the reduced range of motion in your left hip warrant further investigation. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, I suspect this could be a mild inguinal hernia, or possibly a muscle strain. However, to be sure, I'd like to order some imaging - an ultrasound of your groin area. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds perfectly agreeable, Doctor. I’m glad you’re taking this seriously. It’s been worrying me for a while now, and I’m just… relieved to finally know what’s going on, or at least, to be on the path to finding out. I trust your judgment completely. Will you schedule that for me? And… what happens after the ultrasound? Will you explain the results? I apologize for all my questions. I’m just a little bit anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stepno. Questions are good. Yes, I’ll schedule an ultrasound for you. We have an appointment available next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. I’ll send the order to the imaging center, and they will contact you to confirm. After the ultrasound, they will send the results to me, and I’ll review them. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment so I can discuss the results with you and create a treatment plan. Depending on the results, that might involve physical therapy, or, in some cases, a consultation with a surgeon. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates the pain, and you can continue taking ibuprofen as needed. If the pain becomes severe, or you notice any redness or swelling, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Tuesday at 2:00 PM is fine. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Avoiding strenuous activity and continuing the ibuprofen… I can certainly do that. And I will contact the office if the pain worsens. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. I feel… much better now, knowing that we have a plan. I truly appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepno. I'm glad I could help. Just remember to take it easy, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday.
