DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it's about my…business. Down there. I noticed something wasn't quite right, and frankly, at my age, a man doesn’t like surprises. It was in the stool, you see. Blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make me take notice. And I do notice things. I was a pilot for forty years, always had to be alert.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for telling me, Mr. Rowbottom. It's good you're being proactive about this. Any bleeding, even a small amount, is worth checking out. And your history as a pilot certainly speaks to your attention to detail, which is very helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint a picture? It was…red. Obviously. And not bright red, like a fresh cut. More…darker. Like old pennies, maybe? Not clumps, though. More like streaks. Mixed in, you see? Not…separate. Honestly, I haven’t been examining my…leavings that closely, if you don't mind me saying so. I just noticed it wasn't right. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. Darker red, like old pennies, and mixed in with the stool rather than separate – that gives me some useful information. And please, don’t apologize for the level of detail – you're doing a very good job describing what you've observed. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits alongside this bleeding?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you’re asking me to be a…a naturalist. Look, I go when I need to go. Sometimes it’s…firmer, sometimes it’s…less so. Isn't that how it works? I wouldn't say there's been a dramatic change. Maybe a little looser than usual, now that you mention it. And I’ve been going a bit more frequently. But again, at my age, things shift. It's…natural. I’m not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point out changes are common with age, Mr. Rowbottom. And you’re very observant, noting the looser consistency and increased frequency. That’s good information. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in your abdomen, or any other symptoms alongside this – such as fatigue, weight loss, or feeling generally unwell?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A bit of a rumble now and then, but I attribute that to the fish and chips I had last week. Old age comes with its aches and pains, you know. Fatigue…well, I am 88. I tire easily. As for weight loss, I haven't been weighing myself. My wife used to, but…well, that was a long time ago. I eat, I sleep, I generally feel…old. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: "Old" is certainly a symptom of getting older, Mr. Rowbottom, and perfectly valid! But thank you for clarifying, and I appreciate your honesty. No significant pain, and you haven't noticed any unintentional weight loss – that's reassuring. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Humph. Doctors always want a list. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. And the wife always said my blood pressure was a bit high, but I never liked taking pills. Wouldn’t touch ‘em. She made me go to a doctor now and then, but I mostly ignored what he said. Truth is, I've always been a healthy man. Strong as an ox, right up until…well, you know. And I don't recall anything serious. Never had any of those fancy illnesses everyone's talking about these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’ve generally been a healthy man, Mr. Rowbottom. And it's helpful to hear about the appendix removal and history of slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, can you tell me about any medications you currently take, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? As I said, I don't like taking pills. Absolutely nothing. Not a one. And supplements? What would an old pilot need with supplements? I get my vitamins from a good breakfast, thank you very much. Eggs, bacon, toast…that's all a man needs. Honestly, doctors these days…always trying to sell something.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a natural approach, Mr. Rowbottom. That's perfectly valid. And I assure you, I'm not trying to sell anything. I simply want a complete picture of your health. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. I've eaten everything. Travelled the world, tried all sorts of things. Never had a reaction. I used to fly into some pretty rough places, ate whatever they put in front of me. Builds character, you know. Besides, if I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You've certainly lived a full life, Mr. Rowbottom, and that’s a testament to your resilience. No known allergies – that’s good to hear. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. Well, my father lived to be 75, which wasn't bad for a fisherman. He died of…something. Heart, I think. Mother lived a bit longer, maybe 80, but she was frail her whole life. Had some sort of…weakness. A sister, but she died young, in her 40s, from a fever, I believe. Not much to tell, really. They weren't a particularly healthy bunch, if you want the truth. And I haven’t spoken to any of my cousins in decades. Mostly just left it at that. It’s not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rowbottom. That gives me a better understanding of your family background. It sounds like there was some history of heart problems and a general fragility, but nothing definitive. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and a few other basic things. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Humph. Exam, is it? Very well. But don't poke around too much. I’m an old man, not a sack of potatoes. And be quick about it. I haven't got all day. I still have things to do, you know. Birds to watch, memories to…reminisce over. Just get it done. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, though a bit slow, and your lungs are clear. I did notice some tenderness when I pressed on your lower left abdomen. I'm going to check your stool for any evidence of blood. It's a simple test and will help us understand what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Stool test, eh? Really scraping the barrel now, aren't you? Very well. Get it over with. I suppose it's better than nothing. Just try not to…linger. And be sure to wash your hands afterwards. You never know what you’ll find in there. Honestly, these doctors… always poking and prodding. Never a moment's peace.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as quick and discreet as possible. Okay, the sample is collected. We will send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a few days. While we wait for those results, I think it's prudent to consider a few possibilities. The blood you've observed, combined with the tenderness in your abdomen, could be due to a number of things - diverticulitis, colitis, or even something relatively minor like hemorrhoids. We need to rule out anything more serious, however. Given your age and lack of other symptoms, I'm not overly concerned, but I would like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Anemia? Infection? Now you're starting to scare an old man. Look, I just have a bit of blood in my stool. It doesn’t mean I'm on my deathbed. But, very well, if you insist. A blood count. Get it over with. But don’t go making a fuss over nothing. I've lived a long life, seen a lot of things. A little blood isn’t going to stop me now. Just…be quick about it. I’m not fond of needles. And tell me when I can leave. I have a date with a particularly fine robin in my garden.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to want to take things in stride, Mr. Rowbottom. A complete blood count is simply a routine precaution to help us understand what’s going on and to rule out any underlying issues. We are not making any assumptions and are simply being thorough. Alright, the blood sample is collected. It will take a few minutes to process. While we wait, let’s talk about what we’ll do with the results. If the complete blood count comes back normal, and the stool test is negative for infection, we may simply monitor your symptoms and see if they resolve on their own. If anything concerning shows up, we will discuss further testing and treatment options. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or weakness – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fever, dizziness… honestly. You’re painting a dreadful picture. Very well. Monitor symptoms, contact clinic, all the usual doctor talk. I'll try to stay out of trouble, but a man my age can’t always control things. And if this test comes back negative, are you going to stop poking around in my… business? I'm getting rather tired of this whole ordeal. Just tell me when I can go see my robin. It's a particularly handsome specimen, and I don't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: If the tests come back negative, Mr. Rowbottom, we will certainly stop poking around, as you put it. We won't continue unnecessary testing. Our goal is to provide you with peace of mind and to help you continue enjoying your life – including watching your handsome robin. The preliminary results of your blood count are back, and they appear to be within normal limits. That's encouraging. We're still awaiting the results of the stool test, which should be back within a few days. For now, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms. If they worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. Would you like a copy of these preliminary results for your records?
PATIENT: Results within normal limits… finally some good news. A handsome robin is a good sign, I always say. And no, I don’t want a copy of the results. Just tell me I’m not about to drop dead, and I'll be fine. Paperwork just ends up in a pile, and I haven’t got the energy to sort through it. So, can I go now? My robin is waiting. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a bit peckish myself.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, based on the results we have so far, there's no indication that you are about to drop dead. You are perfectly safe to go and enjoy your robin. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And enjoy your day – and your handsome robin! .
PATIENT: Humph. Well. That's…reassuring. A pleasure meeting you too, I suppose. And yes, I will enjoy my robin. It’s the highlight of my day.
