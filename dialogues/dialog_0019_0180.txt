DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I don't have all day. Just... tired. Real tired. And I keep... eating dirt. It sounds crazy, I know, but I can't seem to stop. It started a few months ago, maybe? I dunno. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Just get me something for it, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. “Tired” and… eating dirt. It doesn’t sound crazy to me, and we’ll figure this out together. A few months ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, around then. Maybe spring? Everything's a blur these days. I just want to feel normal again. It's not like I want to eat the stuff, it just... happens. And it doesn’t even taste good, you know? Makes my stomach feel weird. Now, are we done here? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, around spring. And it doesn’t taste good, but you feel compelled to do it. I understand wanting to feel normal, and we’ll work towards that. Before we get to "done," I need to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. It'll help me figure out the best way to help you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, questions? Fine, but make it quick. Honestly, I don’t remember much of anything these days. What kind of questions? And don't ask me about my childhood, I swear. That was a long time ago and not relevant. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: No childhood questions, I promise. We'll focus on now. Okay. First, when you say “tired,” is that just feeling sleepy all the time, or is it more like a lack of energy, even when you’ve slept?
PATIENT: Both, okay? I sleep, but I wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep at all. Like… drained. Empty. It's not just sleepy, it's like my body is… heavy. And I still feel tired even after a full night. It’s awful. Now, can we please move on? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, both sleepy and drained, even after a full night's sleep. That’s very helpful. And the dirt… can you describe when this happens?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? It just… happens. Usually when I'm stressed, I guess? Or bored? Honestly, I don't pay much attention. I just get this… craving. Like I need it. It's hard to explain. It's usually red clay, if that makes a difference. The stuff from the backyard. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing! Just… fix it, okay? I don’t want to be eating dirt forever.
DOCTOR: I won't tell anyone. Red clay, and it happens when you're stressed or bored. That gives us something to work with. Do you find yourself craving anything else unusual?
PATIENT: Unusual? What do you mean? Like… besides dirt? No, not really. Well… sometimes I like really, really cold water. Like, ice cold. But that’s not unusual, is it? Everyone likes cold water. Don't make a big deal out of it. This whole thing is ridiculous. I'm a grown woman, not a baby! Now, can we get to the actual help part? Pills? Something? I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, and the very cold water. It’s good you mention these things, it all helps. It's not ridiculous at all. Now, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I dunno, doc. I’m not exactly paying attention to everything that’s going on with my body. I’m tired, I eat dirt, and I like cold water. What more do you want? My hair's a little thin, maybe? And I bruise easily, I think. I don't really keep track of it. Honestly, I just feel…off. Everything is just…blah. Now, are we getting anywhere, or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: Okay, thinning hair and bruising easily, in addition to feeling “off.” That’s helpful. Now, are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t like pills. Never have. I had a bad experience with something when I was younger, I don’t remember what it was. Just… no. I don’t take anything. And please don’t try to give me something. I don’t want to hear it. Now, can we skip this part? It's pointless! I'm a perfectly healthy person... except for the dirt and the tiredness, of course. But still. No pills. .
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. And you had a bad experience with something in the past. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
