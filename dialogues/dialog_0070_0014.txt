DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Uh, yes, pleasure to meet you as well. Let me see… what brought me in… Oh, right. It’s about some papers. My wife, bless her heart, she said I need something… for work. Something about needing time off, or… maybe not working for a bit? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something with the government, I think? She called it… FMLA? Or… Disability? One of those. I’m the Director of Religious Activities and Education at my church, you see. It’s a lot of responsibility.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your wife is proactively looking into options for potential leave from your position at the church. Both FMLA – Family and Medical Leave Act – and short-term disability are possibilities, depending on the reason for the leave. To help me understand what might be appropriate, could you tell me a little more about why you might need time off?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. See, that’s the part that’s blurry. I’ve been… not myself lately. A bit tired, mostly. And… things just don’t stick in my head like they used to. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. My wife says I’ve been more forgetful, and… well, she worries. I forget things, appointments mostly. And names. Even what I had for breakfast sometimes! It’s worrying her, and, honestly, it’s starting to worry me a little too. It just makes… focusing on things at work harder, you know? It’s a lot to manage, all the activities and education programs.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re experiencing some increasing forgetfulness and difficulty with concentration, and it’s impacting your ability to manage your responsibilities at work. That’s certainly something we need to explore further. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. It wasn’t a sudden thing, like a light switch. It’s been… gradual, over the last… well, maybe six months? A year, even? It’s hard to pinpoint. At first, it was just little things. Misplacing my keys, forgetting a name here and there. But it’s gotten… more frequent, I suppose. My wife says I repeat myself more often, ask the same questions. And… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. It’s frustrating, you know? I always prided myself on my memory.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be frustrating, especially when you’ve always relied on a good memory. Six to twelve months of gradual changes is helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or appetite alongside these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep… it’s been okay, I suppose. Not as restful as it used to be, maybe. I wake up a few times during the night, but nothing major. My appetite… that’s been pretty normal, I think. I still enjoy my meals. Mood… well, I get a little frustrated sometimes, like I said, when I can’t remember things. And maybe a little… anxious? Worrying about it, you know? My wife is a wonderful woman, she does a lot to help, but I don't want to be a burden. It’s just… unsettling, not being myself, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s very helpful. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that much I remember! And… high blood pressure, a few years back. The doctor put me on medication for that, and it’s been pretty well controlled since then. Other than that… not much, to be honest. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. We didn't have much in the way of doctors growing up in Tahiti. Mostly just… natural remedies, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you’ve been managing the high blood pressure with medication successfully?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, quite successfully. I take a small pill every morning. No problems at all. The doctor checks it regularly, and it's always within a good range. I’m very diligent about taking it, you see. My wife reminds me, just in case! She’s very good at keeping me on track. I think… it’s a small orange pill? Or maybe yellow? Oh dear, now I'm getting confused again. It's definitely a pill, though! I'm sure of that.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We can easily verify the details of your medication. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Just the appendix when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. Not much else. I’ve always tried to stay active, you see. Swimming, mostly. We did a lot of swimming in Tahiti. It’s good for the soul, and good for the body. Not been in the water much lately, though. Been too busy, I suppose. And… a little tired, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family, are there any members who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble remembering things towards the end of her life, I suppose. But she lived to be a very old woman, you see. And she always said she was just a bit… scatterbrained! It was just her personality, I think. My father… he was a strong, healthy man. Never had any problems with his memory, as far as I know. We didn’t talk about those things much, you see. It wasn’t something we… dwelled on.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for those things not to be discussed openly. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I'm retired now, as I said, Director of Religious Activities and Education at my church, very involved. I try to stay active, but like I said, I've been a little tired lately. I don't drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. I enjoy reading, mostly history books, and spending time with my wife. We have a lovely garden, she does most of the work in it though, bless her heart. We also volunteer at the local soup kitchen a few times a month. I used to fish more, but haven’t been out in quite a while.
DOCTOR: That’s a very active and fulfilling lifestyle, Mr. Limtiaco. And finally, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. Just the orange… or yellow pill for my blood pressure. No, no, wait! I take a small white pill sometimes, for… allergies. Just when the pollen count is high. My wife reminds me to take that one too, you see. She’s very good at keeping me organized. But that’s it, I think. Just those two. Unless… oh, now I’m getting all confused again. Maybe I should write these things down…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel confused, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s good you have your wife to help keep track of things. We can confirm everything with your pharmacy records later. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check of your vital signs, neurological function, and a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I always figured a good look-over was in order. It’s been a while since I've been to a doctor, you see. Just do whatever you need to do. I’ll just sit here quietly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 138 over 76, which is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within a normal range for your age. Finally, I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment - just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I’ll do my best. A few questions won't hurt, will they? Just try not to make them too difficult, alright? My mind isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course not. We’ll start with something simple. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… today’s date… let me see… It's… August, isn't it? Yes, August… the 2nd? Or is it the 3rd? Oh, I'm so sorry. I just… can’t quite recall. It’s been one of those days. It’s definitely August, though. I’m sure of that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. No need to worry. Let’s try something else. Can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That one… that one should be easy. Uh… let me see… It’s a… a nice town. Lots of… houses. And trees. My wife likes the shops here. I… I think it’s… Suburbia? Is that right? Or is it… something else? It’s a nice place, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: That’s okay. It can be difficult to remember things sometimes. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and then I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and penny. Yes, I can repeat them. Apple, table, penny. I think… I think I’ve got them. But… they seem to be… slipping away already. It's like trying to hold water in my hands, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Don't worry about it. We’ll see how you do. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your medical history again, just to confirm some information. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear… here we go again. Let me see… I’m taking… a pill for my blood pressure. Orange… or yellow? And a white pill sometimes, for… allergies. My wife reminds me. But… that’s it, I think. Unless… oh, I’m so confused. I’m sorry, Doctor. My mind is just… a jumble. I used to have such a good memory!
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We're getting a clearer picture, and it's perfectly normal to feel confused. Thank you for your patience. Now, let's go back to those three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the three words… let me see… This is awful. I… I can’t remember them at all. It’s just… blank. I’m so sorry, Doctor. I’m letting you down. I used to be so sharp. I could remember everything! Now… now I can’t even remember three simple words.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Don't worry about it at all. It’s perfectly understandable. Based on the history you’ve provided and the results of this brief examination, it appears you are experiencing some degree of cognitive impairment, likely affecting your memory and concentration. Now, it’s important to determine the cause of these changes. Several things could be contributing, including medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or early stages of dementia. I recommend we order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We should also consider a more comprehensive cognitive assessment to evaluate the extent of the impairment. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Dementia? Is that… serious? I… I don’t know. Blood work… a comprehensive assessment… It all sounds… rather frightening. But… if it will help, then… yes, I suppose. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I don't want to be a burden to my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. Dementia is a broad term, and there are many different causes and levels of severity. Getting a proper diagnosis is the first step in understanding what's happening and developing a plan. The blood work will help rule out other potential causes, and the comprehensive assessment will give us a clearer picture of your cognitive abilities. I'm going to write an order for the blood work now, and I’ll also schedule you an appointment with a neurologist – a specialist in brain health – for the comprehensive assessment. In the meantime, I recommend that your wife accompany you to the appointments, as she can provide valuable insights. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss with the neurologist?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Having my wife there would be wonderful. She… she remembers everything. And… yes, if I could ask the neurologist… to look into anything that might be causing the forgetfulness. And… anything that might help me… stay sharp, for as long as possible. I still want to be able to enjoy life, you see. And… be there for my wife.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll make sure the neurologist is aware of your concerns. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a social worker who can provide resources and support for both you and your wife. Here are the orders for the blood work and the referral for the neurologist. The scheduling department will contact you to set up the appointments. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And… for being so kind. I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. But… I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. I’ll have my wife call and schedule everything. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand it’s a lot to process, and you’re not alone in this. Remember, early detection and intervention are key. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you and your wife all the best.
