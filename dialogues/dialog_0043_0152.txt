DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a bit high. Hyper… something, I don't remember the big word. They said I should come talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Hyperlipidemia, you mean – high cholesterol. That's a very common finding, Ms. Geho, and we can certainly address it. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, hyper…lipidemia. Yes, that's it. Overall health… hmm. Well, I feel pretty good, actually. I work as an aerospace engineer, so I’m usually pretty busy with projects. I don’t get sick often. I'm single, live alone, and I have Medicare for insurance. Does that help? I'm quite tall, almost seven feet, if you were wondering about that.
DOCTOR: That is all very helpful, Ms. Geho. Seven feet is quite tall, yes! It's good to hear you generally feel well and aren't often ill. Aerospace engineering sounds fascinating. To help me understand the situation a bit better, let's go through a few things. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. No one has ever said anything about blood pressure, and I haven't been told I have diabetes either. I get checkups with my regular doctor, of course, but they usually just check my heart and lungs, and give me a flu shot. I don’t think they ever specifically mentioned those things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Geho. Routine checkups can vary in scope. Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had a bad reaction to any medicine. I don’t take any medicine regularly, just sometimes an aspirin if I have a headache. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body, if that makes any sense. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Geho. Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol are very positive habits. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any heart problems, high cholesterol, diabetes, or stroke in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother... she had some heart trouble when she got older. She needed a pacemaker, I think? And my grandfather… on my father's side… he had a stroke, yes. But other than that, not really. My father was very healthy, and I don’t really know much about my grandmother's health. We weren’t very close. I hope that helps? It’s a bit fuzzy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Geho. Knowing about your mother’s heart condition and your grandfather’s stroke gives us some valuable information. It’s perfectly alright that the details are a bit fuzzy; family history can be difficult to recall precisely. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Well… usually I have a quick breakfast – toast and coffee. Lunch is often a sandwich, something easy I can eat at my desk. Dinner is… variable. Sometimes I cook, fish or chicken with vegetables. Other times I order takeout. I try to eat healthy, but it can be hard when I'm busy with work. I do like my sweets, though. Chocolate, mostly. I don’t really drink soda. Does that sound… terrible?
DOCTOR: Not terrible at all, Ms. Geho. It sounds like a fairly typical diet for someone with a busy lifestyle. The chocolate is perfectly fine in moderation. To get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. That would involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I haven't had a proper physical in… oh, I don’t even remember how long. So, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/90. That's a little elevated. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, the exam is unremarkable, Ms. Geho, but the elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, returning to your cholesterol, do you recall what specific numbers were elevated on the lab report?
PATIENT: Oh. Is 142/90 bad? I don’t really understand numbers. And… no, I don’t remember the specific numbers. Just that the doctor's office called and said it was "high." I think they said something about LDL and HDL? But I don't know what those are, either. I honestly just wanted someone to explain it to me in plain English. Everything feels so… complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Geho. It is complicated, and a lot of medical jargon can be confusing. Let me explain it in plain English. Your blood pressure of 142/90 is slightly elevated. We consider normal to be around 120/80. It doesn't mean you need to panic, but it indicates that your arteries are experiencing a little more pressure than ideal. Now, regarding your cholesterol, think of it like different types of fats circulating in your blood. LDL cholesterol, or "bad" cholesterol, can build up in your arteries, like plaque, and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. HDL cholesterol, or "good" cholesterol, helps remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries. The lab report showed your LDL is elevated at 160 mg/dL, and your HDL is a bit low at 35 mg/dL. These numbers, along with your family history and blood pressure, indicate we need to take some steps to improve your cardiovascular health. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so, LDL is bad and HDL is good. And mine are… the wrong way around. 160 and 35, you said? Yes, that makes a little more sense, thank you. So… what do we do about it? Do I need medicine? I don't really want to take a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. Is there something I can change with my diet, maybe? Or exercise? I walk sometimes, but I'm not very… athletic.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Geho. Let’s talk about that. Fortunately, often lifestyle changes can make a significant difference. Before we discuss medication, let’s focus on diet and exercise. The first step is to reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats. These are found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increasing your fiber intake, through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can also help lower LDL cholesterol. As for exercise, you don't need to be an athlete! Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking is excellent! Even brisk walking can make a big difference. We can also discuss a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a personalized meal plan. Now, regarding medication, your LDL cholesterol is somewhat elevated, and your blood pressure is also a concern. We could consider starting a low-dose statin to help lower your cholesterol and, potentially, a low-dose blood pressure medication. However, let's try lifestyle changes for 3 months first, and then recheck your cholesterol and blood pressure. If those changes aren’t enough, we can revisit the medication discussion. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Three months sounds… good. I'd rather try changing things myself first, if possible. A dietitian sounds like a good idea, too. Maybe they can give me some easy recipes or something. I'm not a very good cook. And walking... I can definitely do more walking. I live near a park, so that’s convenient. Okay. So, a dietitian referral and more walking. And we check the numbers again in three months? That feels… manageable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very sensible approach, Ms. Geho. I will write a referral to a registered dietitian for you. They will be able to provide you with personalized meal plans and recipes tailored to your preferences and needs. I will also give you a handout with information about lifestyle modifications for lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your cholesterol and blood pressure levels. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot less worried now. It’s helpful to have a plan, and to know I don’t have to start taking pills right away.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with the referral information. Have a wonderful day, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. .
