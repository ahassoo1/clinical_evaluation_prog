DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it's about this… shaking. It's just… annoying. Been going on for a while now, honestly. Don't remember exactly when it started, but it's getting worse, I suppose. Just want it fixed, you know? Don't have time for this nonsense.
DOCTOR: "Annoying," you say. Right. And getting worse… can you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? How am I supposed to describe it? It's… my hands, mostly. They tremble. Like a leaf, I guess. Though I haven’t really looked at leaves lately. It happens when I try to do things, like… hold a fork. Or write. Which I don’t do much of anymore, thankfully. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Hmm. Does it happen constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not all the time, no. It’s… when I’m trying to do something with my hands. Sitting still, I don’t notice it much. Though, now that you mention it, maybe it is a little shaky even then? I don’t pay attention to these things, really. Too busy thinking about more important matters.
DOCTOR: So, primarily with action, but perhaps a resting tremor as well… Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… Well, stress, probably. Anything stressful. Though, at my age, everything is stressful! And… uh… coffee, I guess. I used to drink a lot of coffee. Not so much anymore, though. Gives me the jitters, even without the shaking. Don't need more jitters, you understand?
DOCTOR: Stress and coffee… alright. And do you have any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I feel fine, mostly. A little tired, sure, but that’s just getting old. My joints ache, naturally. And… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be. But that's not a symptom, is it? Just… old age. Honestly, I'm not one for dwelling on aches and pains. Waste of good energy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, joint pain… and you mentioned memory issues. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything previously?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with anything? Oh, goodness, probably something back when I was a young man. All sorts of things, I'm sure. I was a busy producer, always traveling, always meeting people… probably caught every bug going around. Can’t rightly remember the specifics. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor always went on about my blood pressure. But it's all a blur, really. Honestly, I'm not much for doctors and hospitals.
DOCTOR: Let me see… the record does indicate hypertension, diagnosed approximately fifteen years ago. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh, let me think. There was that time I fell off a horse when I was younger, but I don't think they operated. Just a lot of bandages and a very angry wife. And… uh… maybe a tonsillectomy when I was a child? Something like that. It was a long time ago. Look, are we getting anywhere with this shaking thing or are we just going to talk about my medical history all day?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Baide. It’s important information. Now, family history. Are there any neurological conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… Oh, now you’re asking! My mother… she was a bit forgetful in her later years, I suppose. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? And my uncle… he was a bit… eccentric. Kept talking to himself and wandering off. But he was always a bit odd. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to family history. Everyone has their quirks, you know? It doesn’t mean anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you currently take any medications, or have you stopped taking any recently?
PATIENT: Medications? Just what the doctor prescribed for the blood pressure, I suppose. Little white pills. Don’t even know what they’re called. Take them every morning, same as always. Stopped taking… hmm… nothing recently, no. Used to take something for my knees, years ago. But it didn’t do much good, so I just stopped. Honestly, I prefer to deal with a little discomfort than fill myself with all sorts of chemicals.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all rather unnecessary. I can feel my hands shaking. What are you hoping to find? But fine, here. Palms up, you said? Don't expect much. It's not like this is going to magically disappear.
DOCTOR: I’m observing the tremor, Mr. Baide. It appears to be a resting tremor, with some increase in amplitude with movement. I also notice a slight rigidity. Your muscle tone feels a little stiff. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose a few times?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s not exactly a graceful performance, is it? And it feels ridiculous, doing this in front of a doctor. Honestly, I feel like a child. Just tell me what's wrong and let me get on with my day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve described and what I've observed, the presentation is suggestive of essential tremor, although it could also be early Parkinson’s disease. It's difficult to say definitively at this stage. We'll need to rule out other potential causes. I would like to order some blood work to assess your thyroid function and vitamin levels. And, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform a more detailed neurological exam and potentially a DaTscan. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: DaTscan? Blood work? A neurologist? Honestly! It's just a little shaking! Do I have to go through all this? I don’t want to be poked and prodded and have all sorts of tests done. Look, is there anything… anything at all… I can take to just make it stop? A pill? A cream? Something simple? I don't have time for specialists and scans and… all this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your reluctance. However, it’s important to determine the cause of the shaking to ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment. While a simple fix would be ideal, we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. There are medications that can help manage the symptoms of essential tremor, but they won’t address any other potential causes. I strongly recommend the neurological evaluation. It's the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and discuss your treatment options. In the meantime, I can prescribe a low dose beta-blocker to see if that helps manage the tremors, but it is not a long-term solution without a proper diagnosis. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Fine! Fine, yes! Give me the pill. Just… make it a small one. And don’t bother me with all the other tests unless absolutely necessary. I suppose a neurologist is better than just letting it get worse. But I’m telling you, I don’t have time for this. And if it doesn't work, I'm not coming back. Is that understood? Now, can I go?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. I'll write a prescription for Propranolol 40mg twice daily. Please start taking it as directed. I'm also going to give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist in the city. Her number and address are on this slip. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to see how you're responding to the medication. If the tremors worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please contact the office immediately. And I do advise following up with Dr. Reed, even if you feel better. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the pill, the neurologist… fine. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have better things to do. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Baide. .
