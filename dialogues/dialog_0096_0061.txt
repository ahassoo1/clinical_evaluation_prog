DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Vilma Burlingham, pleased to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Burlingham. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my son, he says I gotta get checked out. Something about a… a team? He signed me up for somethin’. Old man’s sports, I think he said. My memory ain’t what it used to be, you know? He just said I needed a look-see before I start.
DOCTOR: A team, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. A team… somethin’ with runnin’ and… other folks. He was real excited about it. Said it’d be good for me. I mostly just walk my dog these days, you know? Little chihuahua named Chico. He gets more exercise than I do, probably. I don’t remember much about signin’ up for anythin’. My wife, Elena, she probably knows more details.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Murph, it sounds like your son is… proactive about your health. We’ll figure it out. Before we delve into this “team,” let's just do a general check-up, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds good, Doctor. A general check-up… yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. My bones feel a little creaky in the mornin’, but I guess that’s just gettin’ old, huh? I ain’t had any big problems, nothin’ serious. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Creaky in the morning… alright. Any pain anywhere specific, or just all over?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees, Doctor. And my lower back sometimes, when I bend over to pick somethin' up. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. I try not to lift too much. Elena, she does most of the heavy work now, bless her heart. She's a strong woman.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you been experiencing these aches, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a while now. Years, I reckon. Comes and goes, really. Worse in the winter, when it's cold and damp. I just figured it was the weather. You know, old age and all that. It ain't kept me from walkin' Chico, though! He needs his exercise, rain or shine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Let’s move on. Any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I get a little tired sometimes, but I’m seventy years old, right? I sleep okay, eat pretty good... Elena makes sure of that. Maybe I cough a little in the mornin’, but nothing major. I don’t… I don’t think I’m sick or anything. Is this team… is it somethin’ physical? Like, runnin' and jumpin'? Because my knees ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: A cough, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just a little one. Mostly in the mornin' when I first wake up. It’s not a bad cough, more of a tickle, really. Doesn’t bother me too much. I drink some tea with honey, and it usually goes away. It’s been goin’ on… oh, I don’t know, maybe a few months? It comes and goes with the seasons, I think. More in the winter, like everything else. Does that matter, Doctor? Should I be worried about it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, we are trying to establish a baseline here. Has the cough produced any phlegm?
PATIENT: Phlegm? Uh… I don’t know what that is, Doctor. Like… spit? Sometimes, when I cough real hard, there’s a little… stuff. But not much. It's clear, I think. Or maybe white. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to it. Elena would know, she’s the nurse in the family. She always tells me to watch these things, but… well, I forget, you know? Does phlegm mean somethin' bad? I’m startin’ to get worried now. Is this team somethin’ I shouldn’t be doin’?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant… Hmm. Let me think. I had the flu, real bad, back in… oh, I don’t know, musta been twenty years ago? Spent a week in bed with that one. And my blood pressure was a little high for a while, but they gave me some pills, and it went down. I used to get headaches sometimes, but not so much anymore. Elena says I had a touch of arthritis, but I don’t feel much of that now. I don’t remember bein’ diagnosed with anythin’ serious. Nothing that needed… a lot of doctorin’. Do you want me to ask Elena? She remembers everything. She’s a lifesaver, that woman.
DOCTOR: Did you take those pills for your blood pressure regularly?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s a good question, Doctor. I tried to, you know? But sometimes I'd forget. And sometimes I'd feel alright, and think I didn't need ‘em anymore. Elena, she’d remind me, and I’d get back on ‘em for a while… but I wasn’t always consistent, I gotta admit. It’s hard to keep track of these things when you get older, you know? Little pills everywhere! Are you mad at me, Doctor? I didn't mean to be bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Let's just get through this. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Hmm. Let me think real hard. No… I don’t think so. I broke my wrist once when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but I didn't go to the hospital. My daddy fixed it with a cast. And… oh! I had my tonsils taken out when I was young, but that was just a quick overnight stay. Nothing serious. I mostly just stay out of the hospital if I can help it. It smells like… well, it smells like a hospital, you know? Not a nice smell. Are you sure this team is okay for me? I’m startin’ to worry I’m too old for all this. Maybe my son made a mistake.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, let’s talk about family history. Are your parents still alive?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. They’re both gone now. My daddy passed away a long time ago, when I was still a young man. And my mama… she passed away maybe fifteen years ago? Both from old age, mostly. They lived good lives, as far as I know. They didn’t have much trouble with sickness, not like some folks. They were strong people, hard workers. My daddy was a farmer, and my mama… she kept everything runnin’ smooth. They didn't go to the doctor much either, back in their day. They just… took care of themselves. Do you think that's what I should do? Just try to keep keepin’ on?
DOCTOR: And did either of your parents have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one, Doctor. They didn’t talk much about sickness, you know? Back in their day, people didn’t really have names for things like that. My daddy, he had trouble breathin’ sometimes when he got older, but they just said it was from workin’ too hard in the fields. And my mama… she had trouble with her legs towards the end, but I don’t know what it was. She just slowed down a lot. They didn’t go to the doctor much, remember? They just… suffered through it, I guess. Is this team… is it gonna make me suffer? Because I don't want that. I just want to be able to walk Chico.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good question, Doctor! Let me see… I don't think so. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to any pills I’ve taken. I take a little somethin' for my arthritis sometimes, when it flares up. And I took those blood pressure pills for a while, like I said. But I don’t remember anything bad happenin' with either of ‘em. Elena always double-checks, though. She's got a good memory. She always says, "Don't take that, Mannie, you're allergic!" even if I don’t remember bein' allergic. She's a lifesaver, that woman. Are you sure this team thing is safe? Maybe my son is tryin' to get me to do somethin' I shouldn’t be doin’. I just wanna be careful.
DOCTOR: What medications are you currently taking, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s a good question, Doctor. Let me see… um… I take somethin' for my knees. Little white pill. And somethin’ for my arthritis when it flares up. A little blue one, I think. And I still take those blood pressure pills sometimes, when I remember. And… oh! I take a little somethin’ for my stomach, too. Elena says I got heartburn. But I forget what it looks like. Little yellow one, maybe? She keeps ‘em all organized in a little box. But I don’t always take ‘em, you know? I forget. She keeps tellin’ me to take ‘em, but… well, I forget. Can you ask Elena? She knows everything. This team… is it gonna make me take more pills? Because I don't want that. I just wanna be able to walk Chico.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, with all due respect, this is extremely unhelpful. I need a list of specific medications and dosages. Do you have a pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. A list… dosages… that sounds… complicated, Doctor. Complicated. I think… I think Elena goes to Miller’s Pharmacy down the street? The little one, near the bakery? But I don’t go with her. She usually handles all that. She fills the prescriptions and brings ‘em home. I just… take ‘em. When I remember. She keeps the bottles, though. In the kitchen cabinet. The one next to the… the coffee maker. Maybe she wrote down the names on somethin’? I don't know. This team… is it gonna require a lot of rememberin'? Because I'm not good at rememberin’ things, you know? I just want to be able to walk Chico. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. Stand up… Yes, I think I can do that. Oh dear… it takes a little effort, you know? My knees aren't what they used to be. There we go… a little wobbly, but I'm up. Is this team… is it gonna require a lot of standin’ and walkin’? Because I’m not sure my knees can handle it. I just want to be able to walk Chico.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me check your blood pressure. 160/95. A bit elevated. And your pulse is… 88. Regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear, but I detect a slight murmur. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Now, if you'll turn around… let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished. Not unexpected at your age, but worth noting. Alright, that will do for now.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. That was… a lot. All that listenin' and tappin'… it makes me feel a little nervous, you know? 160/95… is that bad? My heart murmur… is that serious? All those numbers… it's makin' my head spin. Diminished reflexes… what does that even mean? I just want to be able to walk Chico, you know? Is this team… is this team gonna make all these things worse? Maybe my son shoulda asked me before signin' me up for somethin' like this. I just wanna be careful. Is it okay if I just sit down now? My knees are startin' to ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Murph, sit down. Your blood pressure is a little high, yes, but it’s not immediately life-threatening. We can discuss medication to manage it. The murmur is mild, we’ll keep an eye on it. And diminished reflexes are… common with age. It doesn't mean anything drastic. Overall, you're a 70-year-old male with some expected age-related changes. But it’s difficult to assess your overall health without a better understanding of your medication regimen. And frankly, your vague recollection of events is… unhelpful. We need to get a clear list of everything you're taking. Otherwise, I can't provide adequate care. Let's start there. Can you at least tell me what you took today?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Today… let me see… I think I took somethin’ for my knees, the little white pill. And maybe the little blue one for my arthritis, because my knuckles were feelin’ a little stiff this mornin’. And… and maybe the little yellow one for my stomach, because I had a little heartburn after breakfast. But I'm not sure. Elena usually handles it. She tells me what to take, and I just… take it. I don’t really pay attention to the names or the dosages. I just want to feel better. Is this team… is this team gonna make me have to remember all these things? Because I just… can’t. I just wanna be able to walk Chico. Maybe my son made a mistake. Maybe I should just tell him I can’t do it. I just wanna be careful. This is all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, with all due respect, this is becoming increasingly difficult. You need to understand that your lack of clarity puts your health at risk. I’m going to recommend that your son accompany you to your next appointment. Furthermore, I strongly suggest that we schedule a follow-up appointment sooner rather than later, and that Elena attend with you. Until then, I cannot provide any further recommendations regarding this "team". I am going to write you a prescription for a blood pressure medication - Lisinopril 10mg daily. I also recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist to evaluate your murmur. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Lisinopril… a cardiologist… This is… a lot. A lot of new things. My son… you want my son to come with me? And Elena too? I don’t wanna bother them. They’re busy people. And a cardiologist… is somethin’ serious wrong with my heart? I just… I just wanna be able to walk Chico, you know? Is this Lisinopril gonna make me feel different? Is it gonna interact with the little white pill and the little blue one and the little yellow one? Maybe… maybe I should just skip the team. Maybe it’s not worth all this trouble. I just wanna be careful. Is it okay if I just… stop now? Is it okay if I just go home and walk Chico? I just… I just wanna be able to walk Chico.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, I understand you are feeling overwhelmed. However, avoiding necessary medical evaluation and treatment is not a safe option. I strongly recommend you follow my instructions and bring your son and wife to your next appointment. We need to get a clear understanding of your medications and overall health. I am going to provide you with a list of local cardiologists. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I’ve provided you with the prescription for Lisinopril and the referral for a cardiologist. Follow those instructions. I am going to document my concerns regarding your memory and lack of medication adherence. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I don't think so, Doctor. I just… I just want to be able to walk Chico. My son… I’ll… I’ll tell him. And Elena… she’ll know what to do. She always does. I just… I just wish this wasn't so complicated. I guess… I guess I’ll go home now. Thank you, Doctor. I think. I just… I just want to be able to walk Chico.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Murph. Get some rest.
