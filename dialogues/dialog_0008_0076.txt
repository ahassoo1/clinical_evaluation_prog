DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda sore. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And when you say "a little while," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month or so? It started with just one, I think, and then more popped up. Not every day, you know? Slowly. It’s not a sudden thing. I didn’t fall or anything, that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so, starting with one and gradually increasing. And no injury that you recall. Are they itchy at all, or just sore?
PATIENT: Just sore, mostly. Not really itchy. They feel warm sometimes, like a little bit of a sunburn, but not as bad. More like… achy, if that makes sense? Especially when I’m walking a lot. I do a lot of walking at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, sore, warm, achy, especially with walking. That gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I'm getting old, Doctor. A few aches and pains here and there, but nothing I’d connect to these bumps. No fever, no tiredness, nothing like that. Just… the bumps. And the soreness.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no fatigue, just the bumps and soreness. Let’s take a look at them. Could you please sit on the examination table and lift up your pant legs a bit so I can get a good view of your shins?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here you go, Doctor. They’re probably not much to look at, just red little… things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them. There are quite a few. They do appear a bit inflamed and tender to the touch. No obvious breaks in the skin or drainage that I can see right now. I’m going to check your pulses in your feet to make sure circulation is good. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My wife, she always tells me to get my circulation checked. Says I walk too much.
DOCTOR: Pulses are good, 2+ bilaterally. That’s reassuring. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been told I had it. My mother had something with her sugar, but I don’t think I did. I try to eat healthy, you know? Not too much sweets. Mostly rice and fish, that’s what I like.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you travelled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anything unusual – like poison ivy, or new detergents?
PATIENT: No, not really. Been staying pretty close to home. Work, church, home. No trips, no hiking, nothing like that. And my wife does the laundry, so I don’t know what kind of soap she uses. She likes to try new things, sometimes. Probably a fancy one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. It's… lisinopril, I think? And no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't think so. My wife would definitely remember if I did!
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure and no known allergies. Let's review your medical history in the EHR just to be certain. Okay, I see you were diagnosed with hypertension five years ago, and no other significant medical issues listed. No prior surgeries. Family history shows…mother with type 2 diabetes, as you mentioned, and father with heart disease. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My father… he wasn't very healthy towards the end. And my mother, she had to watch her sugar all the time. It runs in the family, I guess. But like I said, I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, these bumps could be a few things. Given your history and the presentation, it's most likely stasis dermatitis. That's inflammation of the skin often caused by poor circulation, which can be common with hypertension. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a localized infection or vasculitis. To do that, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an inflammatory marker called an ESR or CRP. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… stasis dermatitis? Sounds… serious. Poor circulation, you say? I walk a lot, Doctor, is that bad? The tests… alright, yes, if you think it’s necessary. Whatever you need to find out what’s going on. Will they hurt? Are they expensive?
DOCTOR: No, the blood draw itself shouldn't be painful - just a quick pinch. And as for the cost, they're covered by Medicare, so your out-of-pocket expense should be minimal – typically just your standard copay. We'll submit everything to insurance for you. While we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, keeping the area moisturized, and avoiding any trauma to your shins. And, just to be safe, we can apply a topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Not too much pain, minimal cost… I can manage that. Elevate my legs, moisturizer… yes, I can do that. My wife will be happy to remind me! And the cream, yes, if it will help. What kind of cream is it? And how long do I have to put it on? I don’t want to forget.
DOCTOR: It's a mild topical steroid called triamcinolone. You'll apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day for two weeks. After that, we can re-evaluate and see if you need to continue. I’ll write you a prescription for it now. I also want to emphasize the importance of controlling your blood pressure. Are you taking your lisinopril regularly as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I try to. Most days, I do. Sometimes I forget, especially when I’m busy. But I always remember eventually. My wife keeps track too. She’s very good at that. Is it really important to take it every day? It’s just… sometimes I feel alright, so I think maybe I don’t need it as much. But you're the doctor, so I trust you.
DOCTOR: It is important to take it every day, even when you feel alright. Hypertension often doesn't have noticeable symptoms, but it's still damaging your blood vessels. Consistent medication use is crucial for preventing complications. I’ll also give you a handout with information about stasis dermatitis and leg care. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood test results and see how the cream is working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. A handout, and a follow-up… yes, that’s perfect. My wife can help me remember everything too. She's always been good at taking care of me. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better knowing what's going on, even if it's…stasis dermatitis.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It's my pleasure. We'll get those tests ordered, and I’ll see you in two weeks. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like fever, severe pain, or drainage from the bumps – please call the office immediately. Here’s the lab order and the handout. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. I just need to remember to take my pills, put on the cream, and elevate my legs. And let my wife keep track of everything! Thank you again for your time and help. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. Get well soon!
