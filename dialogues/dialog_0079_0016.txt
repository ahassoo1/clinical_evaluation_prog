DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s good to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s about my bruising, really. Seems to be…worse lately. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin…or something like that. The one the other doctor put me on after…well, never you mind. Anyway, I bump into things normally, but now I get these big, dark bruises that just don’t seem to go away. It’s becoming quite a nuisance, frankly.
DOCTOR: I see. Bruising, and you suspect it’s related to the Warfarin. And you say it's been worsening recently… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. Let me think. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but maybe the last month or so? It used to be just a little discoloration, you know, a tap and it'd fade pretty quickly. Now, I swear, I barely look at the furniture and I've got a mark. It’s…unseemly, really. And my wife… well, she would always say something about it. Never mind. It's just…more noticeable now, that's all. Is that good enough? I'm not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, that is quite sufficient. “More noticeable” is helpful. And you mentioned this started about a month ago. Have you noticed any bruising in specific areas, or is it generally all over?
PATIENT: Generally, I’d say. Though… now that you mention it, my legs seem to be the worst of it. Especially my shins. I do tend to knock them on things, admittedly. Old house, you know. Things sticking out everywhere. But it seems like even a gentle tap leaves a mark now. And… I think I had one on my arm the other day, but I can’t be certain. Honestly, I don't go around examining myself for bruises constantly. Is that what I’m supposed to do?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Farson, you are not expected to examine yourself for bruises constantly. Let’s focus on the legs then, as that’s where you’ve noticed it most prominently. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any pain with these bruises?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… a little tenderness, maybe, right after I bump something. But nothing… debilitating. It’s not like a broken bone or anything. More of a… nagging discomfort, I suppose. Honestly, the appearance of it bothers me more than the pain. It's rather unsightly, you know? And I have a… reputation to uphold. I'm a pathologist, after all. People expect a certain… decorum.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, mild tenderness immediately following an injury, but no significant pain. And you're concerned about the cosmetic aspect, given your profession. Now, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any trouble with bleeding elsewhere – nosebleeds, bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood in my stool? Good heavens, no! Certainly not. I haven't… I wouldn't know about that. And nosebleeds, not particularly. I get the occasional one, but nothing that won't stop with a little pressure. My gums… well, I haven't really paid attention, to be honest. I brush my teeth. That's about it. I don’t enjoy dwelling on these… bodily functions. It’s rather unpleasant. Are you implying I should be inspecting those things regularly now?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Farson, I am not implying you should be inspecting those things regularly. I simply need to rule out other possible causes for the bruising. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides what might require this blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well… there was… the heart thing. Years ago. Atrial fibrillation, they called it. That’s why I’m on the Warfarin, of course. And… there was a bit of trouble with my lungs, a long time ago. Pneumonia, I think. But that was ages ago. Fully recovered. Aside from that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing worth mentioning. And my wife… she always said I was a hypochondriac, bless her soul. I probably just worry too much. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes, that explains the Warfarin. And a history of pneumonia. Good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. Appendectomy when I was a boy. And… oh, yes. A hernia repair, quite a few years ago. I don't recall the exact year. And… I think I had my tonsils taken out when I was little, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. Nothing major recently, certainly. Just the usual wear and tear, you know? Is this really necessary? I'm starting to feel like a… specimen under a microscope.
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to get a complete picture, Mr. Farson. Alright. Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders or excessive bruising?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders…now that’s a question. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really…keep track of those things. My family wasn’t exactly forthcoming with medical information. A rather… stoic bunch, you see. My father never said a word about his health, and my mother… well, she was more concerned with appearances. I suspect they both died of… old age, to be perfectly frank. Nothing dramatic. No one dropping dead from mysterious illnesses, if that's what you’re asking. It’s just…not a topic we discussed. Is that…acceptable? I’m not sure I can provide much help on that front.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly acceptable, Mr. Farson. We’ll proceed with what we have. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Besides the Warfarin, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the Warfarin, as far as I know. The other doctor prescribed it, and I have it delivered automatically. I take a… a small white pill, once a day, I believe. And… oh, yes. I take something for my blood pressure. A little blue pill. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… that’s it. I think. I don't really keep a list. My wife used to handle all that sort of thing. It's… difficult, getting used to doing it all myself, you see. Is that helpful? I’m trying to recall everything, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Warfarin and Lisinopril. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not really. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen during the spring, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? And no, I haven’t broken out in hives or had trouble breathing after taking any medication. I’m fairly robust, you see. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I wanted, and I haven’t had any… significant health issues, aside from what we’ve already discussed. Are you quite finished with the questions, Doctor? I’m starting to feel rather… drained.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then examine the areas where you've been experiencing bruising. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If you insist. I suppose it's necessary. Just…try to be quick, Doctor. And please, be gentle. I don’t want to exacerbate the situation any further. I have…appointments later this afternoon, you see. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you’ll just breathe deeply for me… Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… slightly irregular, as expected with atrial fibrillation. Now, let's examine your legs. Please roll up your trousers, if you would. I see some ecchymosis – that’s bruising – on both shins, varying in size. The bruising appears…superficial, but it’s widespread. No signs of acute trauma. And… yes. There's some tenderness to palpation here, and here. No swelling or warmth. Alright. That completes the examination.
PATIENT: Oh, that is a bit uncomfortable, Doctor. You're pressing rather hard, aren't you? And yes, I told you it was tender. Superficial, you say? That’s hardly reassuring. It's quite noticeable, you know. So, what does it all mean, Doctor? Am I dying? Is this Warfarin poisoning? Because frankly, I’m starting to worry. My wife would have known what to do. She always had a… a level head.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, please do not alarm yourself. You are not dying, and it is highly unlikely to be Warfarin poisoning. However, the bruising is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Your blood pressure is a little high, and the irregular heartbeat is consistent with your atrial fibrillation. Given your history, the bruising, and the medication you're taking, I suspect a few possibilities. It could be simply a side effect of the Warfarin, causing you to bruise more easily. It could also be related to your age and potentially some mild vascular insufficiency. But to rule out other causes, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count to check your platelets, a coagulation panel to assess your Warfarin levels, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. I will also order a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels, as high cholesterol can contribute to vascular problems. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests, you say? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather… disruptive. But if you insist, and if it will put my mind at ease… very well. I suppose I have no choice. I do consent. But I expect a prompt turnaround time, you understand. I have a schedule to keep. And please, no surprises. Just tell me, plainly, what’s wrong. None of this… medical jargon. And can you give me something for the bruising? Something to at least hide it? I have a reputation to uphold, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will order the tests immediately. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours, and I will contact you as soon as they are available. As for the bruising, unfortunately, there isn't a medication to magically make it disappear. Topical vitamin K cream might help somewhat, but the best course of action is to avoid injury. I can prescribe a topical cream if you’d like, though. I will also write you a referral to a vascular specialist. It’s best to rule out any underlying vascular issues, given your age and the widespread bruising. They can perform further testing and recommend appropriate treatment, if necessary. Would you like me to schedule that appointment for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: A vascular specialist? Honestly, Doctor, it’s one thing after another. Topical cream… very well. Prescribe the cream, I suppose. It can’t hurt. But I will schedule the appointment myself. I prefer to have control over my schedule. And please, don’t inundate me with phone calls. A single, concise update will suffice. I have… important matters to attend to. Very well. I believe that concludes our… ordeal? Thank you for your time, Doctor. And please, do try to be quick with those results.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I understand. I will ensure a prompt update. Here is a prescription for the topical vitamin K cream, and the referral information for the vascular specialist. Please contact their office to schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as excessive bleeding, severe pain, or dizziness – please contact my office immediately, or proceed to the nearest emergency room. Have a good day, Mr. Farson. And please, try not to worry. We're taking all the necessary steps to address your concerns.
PATIENT: .
