DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that’s why I’m here. It’s been a bit high lately, according to the machine at the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure issues. That’s good you’re keeping an eye on it. Pharmacy machines can be… helpful, but they aren’t always completely accurate. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about when you’ve been noticing these higher readings?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It seems to be mostly in the evenings, after work. During the day it’s usually okay, or at least what I’d consider normal. I work at the assisted living facility, so I’m moving around a lot, I guess that keeps it down then. But once I sit down for dinner… it goes up. And sometimes, if I'm stressed about something, even during the day, it’ll spike a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, evenings after work, and with stress… that gives us something to work with. And you said it's usually okay during the day, while you're moving around at work?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I don’t check it constantly during work, but when I have, it’s been alright. Maybe around 120 over 80, something like that? I’m not a doctor, so I’m not sure what’s good and bad exactly. But the pharmacist said it was fine when I checked it there last week.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. 120 over 80 is generally considered within a normal range. Alright, let’s get a reading here in the office just to have a baseline. Then we can talk a little more about your overall health history. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. And okay, getting a reading here sounds good. I always get a little nervous when they take it at the doctor's office, though. It always seems higher!
DOCTOR: That’s very common, actually – what we call “white coat hypertension.” It happens to a lot of people. We'll try to take a few readings, and we can also discuss ways to monitor it at home to get a more accurate picture. Before we do that, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I don’t really have much of a medical history, to be honest. I haven’t been sick much, thankfully. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that kind of thing. But nothing serious. I had a C-section with my son, about ten years ago, but that went well and I healed up okay. Other than that… just the occasional cold. My mother had diabetes, if that matters. But I don’t think I’m at risk for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so relatively healthy overall. C-section ten years ago, and a family history of diabetes with your mother. That does matter, thank you for mentioning that. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. Just vitamins sometimes, a multivitamin. And maybe some ibuprofen if I have a headache, but not often. I really try to just rest when I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, let's get that blood pressure checked. I’m going to have you sit here for a few minutes and relax. We'll take a reading now, and then again after five minutes.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I hope it’s not too high. I really don’t want to have to take medication, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll see what the readings are first, and then we can discuss all of your options. Sometimes lifestyle changes can make a big difference. Now, just try to relax and keep your arm still. This won't take long. …148 over 92. Hmm. And your pulse is 78. Let's wait a few minutes and take another reading.
PATIENT: Oh. 148 over 92… is that bad? That sounds… high, doesn’t it? I was a little nervous, maybe that’s why?
DOCTOR: It is a bit elevated, yes. And you're right, nervousness can definitely play a role. But even accounting for that, it’s higher than we’d like to see. We'll take one more reading in a few minutes to see if it comes down. In the meantime, I want to ask you a bit more about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink alcohol on special occasions – like Christmas, or a birthday. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s it. I don’t drink regularly at all. I try to stay healthy, like I said. I really don't want to get sick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I'm on my feet a lot at work, if that counts? I'm a caregiver at the assisted living facility, so I’m walking and lifting and helping people all day. But I don't really exercise exercise, like going to the gym or anything. I used to walk more, when my son was smaller, but I don’t have as much time now. It’s hard to find the time, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Being on your feet all day at work does count for something, absolutely. Let's take another blood pressure reading now. …152 over 95. It’s unfortunately gone up a bit. Given these consistent readings, even taking into account your anxiety, I’m concerned about the possibility of hypertension. Now, I don't want to immediately jump to medication, but we need to investigate this further. Would you be willing to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, and keep a log of your readings?
PATIENT: Oh dear. 152 over 95… that doesn’t sound good at all. Monitor it at home? I guess so. I mean, if that’s what you think is best. I’ve never done that before. How would I even… do that? And where do I get a machine? I really don't want to have to take medication, but I also don't want to get worse, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. Monitoring at home will give us a better picture of your blood pressure throughout the day, and help us determine if this is a consistent problem. You can purchase a blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. I can give you a list of some recommended brands. They're relatively inexpensive. As for how to use it, it’s quite simple. I’ll have the nurse demonstrate the proper technique before you leave. We’ll also need some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work and a machine… that sounds like a lot. But if it helps, then I guess so. I really appreciate you explaining everything. And thank you for offering to have the nurse show me how to use the machine. I'm a little scared, to be honest. But I want to get this figured out. So, yes. Let’s do the blood work and get the machine. What do I need to do for the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel scared. We’ll get through this together. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is okay. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form with detailed instructions. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and go over your home blood pressure readings. How does next Friday sound?
PATIENT: Next Friday sounds alright. As long as it’s not too early. I need to arrange coverage at work, you know? And okay, no food for eight hours… I can do that. I guess I’ll have to have a big dinner tonight! So, a requisition form and the machine. And then I monitor it at home and come back next Friday. I think I have that right? It’s just… a lot to take in. Thank you again for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right. Requisition form for blood work, get a blood pressure machine, monitor your blood pressure at home, and then we’ll review everything next Friday. And yes, it is a lot, and you’re very welcome. My pleasure. Let me just write down a few recommended blood pressure machines for you, and the nurse will be in shortly to show you how to use them and review the blood work instructions. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really well. I’m a little nervous about taking my own blood pressure, but I’m sure I can manage. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Don’t hesitate to ask the nurse any questions you have. And remember, we’re here to help. I’ll see you next Friday. .
