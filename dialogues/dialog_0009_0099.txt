DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach, an endoscopy, I believe it was called. My regular physician suggested I come and discuss them with you, as they were… abnormal.
DOCTOR: Okay, an endoscopy. Yes, that would give us some good information. And your regular physician thought it best to have me take a look at the results with you. That's perfectly reasonable. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For several months, I’ve been experiencing some… discomfort. Not pain, precisely. More like a persistent, nagging feeling in my stomach. And, occasionally, some… difficulty digesting my food. It wasn’t severe enough to keep me from my work, but it was… bothersome. My doctor thought it best to investigate, hence the endoscopy. I do hope it wasn't anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent discomfort and difficulty digesting. I understand. And how long ago did you have the endoscopy performed?
PATIENT: Let me see… it was approximately three weeks ago, on the 12th of July, I believe. Yes, the 12th of July. It was a Monday. I remember because I had to reschedule a small metal order for a client; it caused a bit of a fuss, thankfully I managed to sort it out. They sent the results to my doctor a week later, and she suggested I make an appointment with you as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 12th. Let me just pull up those results here… Yes, I see it. The report does show some inflammation in the stomach lining and a few small polyps were identified. I appreciate you remembering the date, that's very helpful. Now, these polyps… they are quite small, according to the report, but we do want to investigate them further just to be safe. Have you ever had any similar tests or procedures done before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. This is quite new to me, truthfully. I have always been… quite healthy, all my life. I eat a balanced diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I keep very active with my metal work. It is demanding, but it keeps me strong. To have this discovered… it is a little unsettling, to be honest. What does "investigate further" entail, if you don't mind me asking?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Ms. Minatra. It is unsettling to learn something unexpected about your health, especially when you've been feeling well. “Investigate further” in this case means we would ideally take a biopsy of those polyps during a repeat endoscopy. This will allow us to determine exactly what they are and if any treatment is needed. The procedure itself is similar to the first one – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your stomach to visualize the lining and take small tissue samples. It’s generally well-tolerated, but we do want to discuss the risks and benefits with you fully before proceeding. Before we talk about that, though, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I have not noticed any blood in my stool, and my weight has remained… stable, shall we say. I have always been slender, but I haven’t lost any weight that I am aware of. My appetite has been normal as well. I will admit, I have been feeling a little… fatigued lately. But I attributed that to the summer heat and the demands of my work. It has been exceptionally warm, even for this time of year. Perhaps I am simply getting old.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is good to mention, Ms. Minatra, and it’s certainly possible the heat and work are contributing factors. However, it's important to consider everything, especially given the endoscopy results. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. My mother… she passed away several years ago, at the age of eighty-two. She lived a long life, but she suffered from… arthritis, mostly. And she had some issues with her gallbladder, I recall. My father, he was a strong man, a builder, but he had heart problems later in life. No history of stomach issues, to my knowledge, on either side of the family. My brother, Eduardo, he is still living, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I do not know much about his health. We… drifted apart, I’m afraid. A long story for another time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Minatra. It’s helpful to know. And you don’t need to feel obligated to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I have never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that is all. And recreational drugs… goodness, no. I am a very simple woman, with a simple life. I find my pleasure in my work, in creating beautiful things with metal. It keeps me grounded, keeps me focused. I do enjoy a strong cup of coffee in the mornings, however. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That absolutely counts, Ms. Minatra, and I appreciate your honesty. A strong cup of coffee is perfectly fine. Okay, so to summarize: you’ve experienced some persistent discomfort and difficulty digesting, the endoscopy revealed some inflammation and small polyps, no blood in your stool or weight loss, a family history of arthritis and heart problems, and you have a healthy lifestyle with no smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Given these findings, I agree with your regular physician that we should investigate those polyps further with a repeat endoscopy and biopsy. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe so. If that is your recommendation, I trust your judgment. I understand it is the responsible course of action. To be honest, I would rather know what I am dealing with than to live in uncertainty. So, yes. Let us proceed with the repeat endoscopy and biopsy. When would that be possible? And… what can I expect?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Ms. Minatra. It is best to have a clear understanding of what’s going on. We can schedule the endoscopy at our outpatient surgery center as early as next week, likely Tuesday morning. You would need to fast after midnight the night before – no food or liquids except for small sips of water. The procedure itself typically takes about 15-20 minutes. You'll be given a mild sedative to help you relax, and a local anesthetic will be sprayed in your throat to minimize discomfort. The endoscope is then gently inserted into your stomach, and the doctor will visualize the lining and take small tissue samples. You may feel some mild bloating or cramping afterward, but it’s usually very well-tolerated. You’ll need someone to drive you home, and I recommend taking the rest of the day off to rest. The biopsy results usually take about a week to come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions about the procedure, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: That… sounds manageable, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so thoroughly. Tuesday morning… yes, that should work. I do have a friend, Isabella, who could drive me. And yes, I will be sure to take the day off. The biopsy… what exactly are we looking for? Are these polyps… dangerous? I apologize for asking such direct questions, but I am a little anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: You're not being direct at all, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious, and I encourage you to ask any questions you have. The biopsy helps us determine the type of polyps and whether they are benign or pre-cancerous. Most polyps are benign – meaning they aren’t harmful – but it's important to rule out any potential for cancer. The risk of cancer from these polyps is very low, especially given their small size. However, if they are pre-cancerous, we can easily remove them during the endoscopy, preventing them from developing into something more serious. We’ll send the samples to a pathologist who will examine them under a microscope and provide us with a detailed report. I will explain the results to you thoroughly and discuss the best course of action based on the findings. Does that help to ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does help, thank you. Knowing that most are benign is… comforting. And knowing that they can be removed if necessary… that is also reassuring. So, Tuesday morning it is. I will arrange for Isabella to drive me, and I will be sure to fast. Is there anything else I should do to prepare? Any medication I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. Regarding preparation, if you take any blood thinners, such as warfarin or aspirin, please let me know, as we may need to adjust your dosage before the procedure. Otherwise, just stick to the fasting instructions and bring a list of all your medications with you. Also, please let the nurse know if you have any allergies, particularly to anesthesia or sedatives. We’ll provide you with detailed written instructions before you leave, but please don’t hesitate to call our office if you have any questions or concerns leading up to the procedure. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been very thorough and… kind, to be honest. I was quite anxious before this conversation, but I feel much more at ease now. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could ease your mind. It’s my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind before Tuesday. I’ll see you then. And please, try to relax and get some rest. Have a good day, Ms. Minatra.
