DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, good mornin'. My nails. They just... look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don't really... remember how they changed, exactly. Just... different. It bothers me, see? I noticed it a little while ago, I think. It’s just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your nails have changed in appearance and that's concerning to you. It’s good you're bringing it to my attention. And don’t worry about not remembering exactly when or how—sometimes these things creep up on us. Let's take a closer look. To help me understand what's going on, can you describe what "different" means?
PATIENT: Different… uh… they’re kinda… yellow-ish? And not a pretty yellow, like a sunflower. More like… old. Old paint kinda yellow. And one of ‘em… it’s thicker, maybe? Like it's growin’ weird. I don’t know. I don’t look at my hands much. I work with ears, not hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing and thickening—that gives me a little more to work with. And you mentioned one nail is particularly thick… is that on a finger or a toe?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… a toe. Yeah, a toe. The big toe on my… right foot, I think. Everything feels mixed up. I always get my left and right mixed up, too. It’s embarrassing, really. But it’s definitely the big toe. It's kinda… bumpy now, too. Like a little… hill.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Yellowing, thickening, and a bumpy texture on your right big toe. And you’re experiencing some difficulty with distinguishing left from right. I'd like to take a closer look at your toe, if that’s alright with you. Also, I'm going to ask a few more questions to get a broader picture of your health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ugh. More questions? Fine, I guess. But I don’t have a good memory, so don’t be surprised if I don't know the answers. And please don’t make me take off my shoes, doc. I just got a new pedicure. It's… a nice color.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. We’ll take things at your pace. And don’t worry about the pedicure—we can work around it. I promise I'll be as quick as possible. First, let's start with your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, no. Never been told that. Circulation… I don’t know. My feet get cold sometimes, but that’s just 'cause I’m always cold. I’m always cold. Medicare comes to see me about my ears every year, they haven’t said nothin’ about circulation. They check my ears. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known diabetes and Medicare hasn’t raised any concerns about circulation during your ear exams. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Uhm... surgery... let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think. A long, long time ago. And… oh! I broke my arm once, when I was a kid too. Fell outta a tree. That's it. Nothing since then. Mostly just ear stuff, see? Regular check-ups. That's why I got Medicare. They take care of the ears.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and a broken arm in childhood. Mostly regular ear check-ups with Medicare. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—who has similar problems with their nails, or any skin conditions in general?
PATIENT: Skin… problems? My mother, she had… somethin’ on her hands, maybe? I don’t really remember. It was red and flaky, I think. She used a lot of cream. And my brother… he never liked wearin’ shoes. But that's 'cause he was weird. Didn't care for feet either. Didn't help that he always smelled funny. I don’t think he had nail stuff though. Just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly some skin condition in your mother, but you’re unsure, and your brother didn’t have nail issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uhm... let me see. I take somethin' for my ears, of course. Little drops. The doctor gives them to me. And sometimes, when my ears bother me real bad, I take… a white pill. Don’t know what it is. And I take a vitamin… a multi-vitamin, I think. That's it. Just the ear drops, the white pill, and the vitamin. Probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, ear drops, a white pill for ear pain, and a multi-vitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. I think I was allergic to somethin’ as a kid… pollen maybe? I sneezed a lot. But I'm okay now. I don’t remember ever bein’ really sick from nothin’. Except maybe bad ear infections. But those were just ear things. Don’t make me take off my shoes, doc. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known current allergies beyond possible childhood pollen sensitivity. And I promise, Ms. Thut, we won't be taking off your shoes today. Okay, let’s take a look at that toe. As you mentioned, the nail is yellowed, and I see some thickening, and yes, it does appear slightly bumpy. I'm also noting some debris under the nail. Does it cause you any pain when I touch it?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! A little. It’s kinda… tender. Not terrible pain, just… sensitive. Like when you bump your elbow. Just a little. It’s worse when I wear shoes, I think. Especially new shoes. They squeeze it. But it's mostly just... annoying. It's just lookin' bad, see? That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tenderness and discomfort with pressure, particularly when wearing shoes. I'm not feeling any significant warmth or swelling, which is good. It does seem to be localized to this one toe. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it’s possible you have a fungal nail infection, also known as onychomycosis. It's common, and it can cause the nail to become discolored, thickened, and brittle. However, to be certain, we’d need to do a test to confirm. Would you be okay with me taking a small scraping of the nail to send to the lab?
PATIENT: A...fungus? Like, mold? Oh, no. That sounds awful! And a scraping? You mean... cut off part of my nail? No! I just got a pedicure! You can't cut off my nail. Seriously, doc. That’s… that’s not happening. I don't want fungus, and I don't want you cuttin' my nail. What else can we do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Thut. It’s a very small scraping, barely noticeable, and it wouldn’t affect your pedicure. We would send it to the lab to confirm if it is a fungus, so we know how to treat it. But if you're truly uncomfortable with that, we can explore other possibilities, though it does make a diagnosis more difficult. It could also be a nail injury, or a skin condition like psoriasis. But without the test, we’re just guessing. We can try a topical antifungal cream for now, and see if that helps. It may take several months to see a difference, and it’s not always effective without knowing for sure what we’re treating. What do you think?
PATIENT: A cream... that sounds better. No cuttin'. I don't like the sound of cuttin' at all. Will it smell bad? And will it mess up my polish? I just got a really nice color, a shimmerin' pink. Several months, you say? That’s a long time. But no cuttin', right? Okay. A cream. But if it doesn't work, don't try to cut off my nail. Promise me.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Thut, no cutting. We'll start with the topical cream. It shouldn’t smell bad, but some people find the vehicle—the cream base—has a slight odor, but it usually dissipates quickly. And it might slightly affect the polish, so you may need to reapply it more frequently. I'm going to write you a prescription for a topical antifungal cream called ciclopirox. Apply it to the affected nail once daily, after thoroughly cleaning and drying the area. And be sure to file the nail down a bit each week to help the cream penetrate. It’s important to be consistent with the application, and it can take several months—up to a year—to see complete resolution. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see how you’re doing. If you’re not seeing any improvement, we can re-discuss the option of the lab test. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Three months… okay. File it down? Oh, dear. I’m terrible with filing. But no cuttin’. Fine. A cream, file it down, three months. I guess that's okay. What if it smells? My feet already smell a little sometimes, even with the new polish. Don't make me take off my shoes, doc. Seriously. And write it down, about the no cuttin'. Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll write everything down for you, including specific instructions and a clear note about no cutting. As for the smell, if the cream does cause any odor, it should be minimal and can usually be masked with foot powder or lotion. If it’s bothersome, you can also try wearing breathable socks and shoes. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion, including the prescription details and the instructions for applying the cream. I've also noted “No nail cutting” prominently on the sheet. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think that's all. Just... don't make me take off my shoes. And don't let anyone cut my nail! I don't trust people. Especially people with… tools. Thank you, doc. You were very nice. Even though you tried to cut my nail.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Thut. I'm glad I could help. And I assure you, I have no intention of cutting your nail. It's documented: no cutting. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. .
PATIENT: Okay. Bye. .
