DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Sasha. It’s… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up, you see. After the… the treatments. It's not painful, exactly, just… big. And it worries me.
DOCTOR: "Treatments," you say. Could you elaborate on those treatments, Sasha?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It was… for the cancer. A few years ago now. They… did a lot of radiation, and some… pills. And then there was the surgery, of course. I don't remember all the names of the things, honestly. It was a long time ago, and a lot to take in. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, I suppose. Though specifics are always preferred for proper charting, naturally. And the surgery… what type of surgery was performed, to the best of your recollection?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… they took out… a piece. A piece of… something. It was in my leg, obviously. They had to cut it open, of course. It was… a big surgery, I think. They were in there a long time. Honestly, Doctor, I was very… out of it. I don’t… I don't really remember the details. They just said it was to get rid of the bad stuff. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… suboptimal, that you don’t recall the specifics, but not entirely unexpected given the circumstances. We'll proceed as best we can. Now, this swelling… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started… maybe a month ago? Slowly, you see. I thought it was just… getting old. My ankles always feel a little puffy sometimes. But this is… more than that. It's definitely bigger now. And it feels… tight. Like my skin is going to burst, almost.
DOCTOR: "Tight," you say. And is this swelling confined to one leg, or is it present in both?
PATIENT: Oh, just the left one. The one they… operated on. The right one is fine. Perfectly normal. It's just the left one that’s being… troublesome. It's not hurting, you understand. Just… there. And getting bigger. It makes wearing shoes difficult, which is… annoying.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” is it?
PATIENT: Well, yes! I like to garden, you see. And you can’t garden properly in slippers. It's a very… practical problem, Doctor. A very practical problem indeed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's assess this “practical problem” objectively. The circumference of your left leg is noticeably larger than your right. And there is some… pitting edema present when I apply pressure. It’s not severe, but it’s certainly there. Do you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn't sound good, does it? No, no shortness of breath. And my chest feels fine. Perfectly normal. I mean, I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but that’s just… old age, again. I haven't had any pain, though. Just the swelling. It feels… strange, honestly. Like it’s not my leg anymore.
DOCTOR: "Strange" is a rather unhelpful descriptor, Ms. Queener. Now, have you noticed any changes in the skin of your leg?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… now that you mention it… it is a bit red. Not all over, just… around the ankle. And it feels a little warm. Warmer than the other one, maybe. I hadn’t really paid attention, to be honest. I just thought it was… the slippers. They’re a bit snug.
DOCTOR: Slippers, naturally. Ms. Queener, while I appreciate your… pragmatism, it's important to understand that this swelling, combined with the redness and warmth, warrants further investigation. It could be a sign of several things, including a blood clot, infection, or lymphedema. We will need to order some blood work and a Doppler ultrasound to assess the circulation in your leg.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood work? An… ultrasound? Will it hurt? I don't like needles, you see. And I have a garden to tend.
DOCTOR: The blood work is a routine procedure, Ms. Queener. A small prick, barely noticeable if you don’t dwell on it. And the ultrasound is non-invasive; it simply uses sound waves to create an image of your leg. It won’t hurt a bit. However, delaying this investigation could have… consequences. It’s far better to be proactive and rule out anything serious. I will have my nurse draw the blood samples now, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it like that. I suppose you’re right. I don't want any… consequences. Alright. Blood work and… sound waves. Tomorrow morning. Very well. But please, tell the nurse to be quick. I have tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I will inform the nurse to be as expeditious as possible. Let’s proceed with the blood draw, then. I’ll be back to discuss the results once they are available. In the meantime, please elevate your leg as much as possible and avoid prolonged standing.
PATIENT: Alright. Elevate and… avoid standing. Sounds… tiring. Thank you, Doctor. .
