DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Pol…Polczynski, is it? Yes, right. Well, it’s about this letter. My…daughter’s new apartment building, you see. They need a letter saying I own a pet. Something about…rules. Honestly, the paperwork these days! It's a dog, lovely thing. A big one. But I can't quite remember what they need on the letter. It’s all a bit of a fuss, really.
DOCTOR: Polczynski, yes, that’s right. And no problem at all, Deloris. A pet ownership letter…I can definitely help with that. Just to clarify – is this for a new rental agreement?
PATIENT: Rental…yes, that’s it. New rental. My daughter found a nice place, finally. Though it's a bit small for a dog, if I'm honest. She assures me it’ll be fine. Anyway, the building management…they want proof. A letter from a doctor, can you believe it? Why a doctor? It feels a bit much, doesn't it? I suppose they want to be sure I’m responsible enough to own a dog. Honestly, I’ve had dogs my whole life!
DOCTOR: It is a bit unusual, requesting it from a doctor. Perhaps they're looking for confirmation of your overall health and ability to care for a pet, in a roundabout way. It’s good they’re being thorough, I suppose. So, to get started… How long have you owned this dog?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…that's a tricky one. Years, definitely. A good few years. Longer than my daughter has been independent, certainly. She’s…twenty-four now, I think. So, more than twenty-four years. Though I got him as a puppy, and puppies…they don't keep for long, do they? I wish I had a better memory for these things! He’s a good boy, though. A very good boy. A bit boisterous, perhaps.
DOCTOR: More than twenty-four years…that’s wonderful! A long and happy relationship. And “boisterous” is good to know. It sounds like he’s a lively companion. Just to document everything properly, Deloris, could you tell me what kind of dog he is?
PATIENT: Oh, you know…one of those big fluffy ones. A…a Newfoundland, I think? Or maybe a Saint Bernard? They look very similar, don’t they? Dark brown, very hairy, sheds everywhere. My daughter keeps telling me I need to brush him more, but honestly, it’s a losing battle. He's a rescue, so I don’t have his papers or anything. Found him wandering near the market, poor thing. A real sweetheart, though.
DOCTOR: A rescue, that’s lovely! And don’t worry about the exact breed, it’s not critical. Knowing he’s a large breed is helpful. Now, have you had any health concerns recently that might affect your ability to care for him?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Health…well, I’ve got the usual aches and pains, you know? Getting older isn't for the faint of heart! My knees aren't what they used to be, so long walks are a bit of a struggle sometimes. And I had a little…a little bout of something last year. The doctor gave me some pills. It cleared up fine, though. Nothing to worry about now, really. I’m perfectly capable, honestly. It’s just…sometimes I forget things. Like what I had for breakfast! But that doesn't mean I can’t look after a dog.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee pain and a previous illness that has resolved. And occasional forgetfulness. That's all helpful to know. Just to be completely sure, were you ever diagnosed with anything specific relating to your memory, like dementia or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Nothing like that. Just…senior moments, you know? I misplace my keys, forget appointments. Perfectly normal. My mother was the same. It’s just…age, dear. It’s not a condition, it’s just…life. Honestly, I'm as sharp as a tack most of the time. Don’t go writing anything dramatic now! I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of providing a loving home for my dog. It’s just…sometimes I need a little nudge. A reminder here and there. But that's it! Really.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. It's good to be thorough. And I'm not writing anything dramatic, just making sure I have a complete picture. Just one last quick question for now, Deloris. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…medications. Yes, I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill, once a day. And something for my knees, when they’re acting up. It’s a pain reliever, nothing strong. Allergies…not that I know of. I eat everything! I'm Nigerian, you know, we have quite adventurous palates! No, no allergies. Though I once had a bad reaction to some shellfish, but that was years ago. Honestly, I can’t remember the details. Everything seems to blur together these days. But no current allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and occasional pain reliever. That's helpful. Alright, Deloris, I think I have enough information for now. Just to confirm, you'd like a letter stating you are a pet owner and, to the best of your knowledge, are capable of providing adequate care for a large breed dog?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s perfect. Just something to satisfy the building management. Honestly, the fuss they make. But yes, a letter confirming I own a pet and can look after him. That's all I need. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with my…forgetfulness. It’s nice to meet someone who doesn't make a fuss.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. It’s no trouble at all. I’ll get that letter prepared for you now. It should only take a few minutes. Here you go. It confirms your pet ownership and states that, to the best of my knowledge, you are capable of providing adequate care. It also mentions the blood pressure medication you’re on. Does that seem accurate?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely! Let me see… Yes, that looks perfect. “Adequate care”…that’s good. And you mentioned the medication, yes. Good, good. They shouldn't complain now. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve really saved me a lot of trouble. Honestly, paperwork is the bane of my existence. How much do I owe you?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. I’m glad I could help. Let me see… for a letter like this, it will be \$50. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: \$50…yes, that’s perfectly reasonable. Here you go. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a lifesaver. Honestly, I don't know what I would have done without you. Now I can finally relax and enjoy my dog!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. I’m glad I could assist you. Enjoy your time with your dog! And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else in the future. Have a lovely day!
