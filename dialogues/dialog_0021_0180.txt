DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. I’m Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's this... tiredness. It's just getting to me, okay? And… well, it's embarrassing, but I been… eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It's stupid, I know. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness…and a craving for dirt. Okay. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling excessively tired?
PATIENT: Excessively… like, what does that mean? I'm always tired. But, uh… I guess it's gotten worse the last few months? Maybe? It's hard to say. Things kinda blend together these days. My husband… he passed a couple years ago, and… well, things haven't been the same. I just don't have the energy to do things. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: A couple of years... I see. And this lack of energy… does it interfere with your daily routine?
PATIENT: Routine? I work. I go home. I eat. I sleep, when I can. That's pretty much it. It’s harder to… concentrate at work. I program those… computer machines, you know? CNC… something. It takes a lot of focus, and I just… can't anymore. I keep making mistakes. It’s frustrating. My boss is starting to give me looks.
DOCTOR: CNC machines…okay. And these mistakes, are they new?
PATIENT: New-ish. Like I said, the last few months. Before, I was good at it. Really good. Been doing it… a long time. But now? Everything feels… foggy. And I'm so… weak, all the time. I try to eat, but it doesn’t help. And then I get this urge… for dirt. It's weird, I know. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: It's not about judging, Hedy. It’s about figuring out what's going on. This craving for dirt… is it a constant craving, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It's worse when I'm really tired, I think. It’s not like I go searching for it, but if I’m outside… gardening, or something… and I smell the earth? I just… gotta have a little. Just a bite. It sounds awful, doesn’t it? My mother would be mortified.
DOCTOR: It’s unusual, certainly. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Cravings? Like… for sweets? No. Just… the earth. And… sometimes ice. A lot of ice. I chew on it all the time. Does that… count? Look, I just want to know what's wrong with me. I don't need a lecture about eating dirt.
DOCTOR: Chewing ice, okay. Let's get a bit of your medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is going to take all day, isn’t it? Okay, okay… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long time ago. And… I had some trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they gave me some pills and it went away. Nothing else, really. I'm pretty healthy, mostly. Except for… this. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, okay. Do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: No! Heavens, no. I threw out all the bottles when I stopped taking it. Too many pills everywhere. I don't like taking pills. It made me feel… funny. I just want to be left alone, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, no medication name. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to be a really good cook, before… well, before. Never had a problem with allergies. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. Though, lately… even food doesn’t taste good. Everything’s kinda… bland.
DOCTOR: Bland… alright. Let's talk about your family. Is there any history of medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Medical problems... Honestly? I don't really keep up with that sort of thing. My mother had… something with her bones, I think. She broke a hip when she was old. And my father… he worked too hard. Just always tired. But nothing… serious. They weren't ones for going to doctors. Said it was a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Alright. And… are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No! Like I said, I don’t like taking pills. Not even for headaches. I just… deal with it. I used to take a multivitamin, a long time ago, but I stopped. It didn't seem to do anything. Honestly, I just want to get this figured out. I'm wasting my whole day here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms… the tiredness, the craving for dirt and ice, the bland taste… and given your history, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. And I'm going to order some blood work, just to rule out a few things. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Ugh. More poking and prodding? Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But if it takes all day, I'm leaving. And no, don't explain everything to me. Just do it. I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Fine. Just be quick about it. My arm gets cold easily. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 138/85. Not drastically, but something to monitor. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let me listen to your lungs. Breathing sounds are clear, but a little… diminished. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Now, I'm going to check your iron levels with a quick finger prick. It won't hurt much.
PATIENT: Ugh. Finger prick? Seriously? Just get it over with. My grandmother always said I have thin blood, anyway. This is probably going to hurt. And I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: There, all done. Just a little pinch. Now we’ll wait for the results. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait, do you have any recent history of dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Dizziness...sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Nothing major. And… no, I haven’t been short of breath. Just… tired. Always tired. And this craving. It’s so embarrassing to even talk about. It’s not like I want to eat dirt. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your hemoglobin is…low. Quite low, actually. 9.5. That indicates anemia. And your iron levels are also very low. Your iron saturation is 12%, which is significantly below normal. This explains the tiredness and weakness. The craving for dirt – a condition called pica – can sometimes be a sign of iron deficiency. The ice chewing as well. It seems like you’re suffering from iron deficiency anemia. Now, we need to figure out why you’re deficient. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or black, tarry stools recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, what? Anemia? Blood in my stool? No! Absolutely not. I haven’t checked! Why would I check? Honestly, this is ridiculous. It’s just… tiredness. And a craving. You make it sound like I'm dying.
DOCTOR: You are not dying, Hedy. But iron deficiency anemia can have a number of causes, and we need to determine the underlying one. The most common causes are blood loss, poor diet, or difficulty absorbing iron. Since you haven’t noticed any blood in your stool, that makes significant gastrointestinal bleeding less likely, but we still need to investigate. I’m going to order a stool test to rule out any hidden blood. And I’m also going to recommend a complete blood count with iron studies, to get a more detailed picture. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an iron supplement to start replenishing your iron stores. It's important to take it as directed, and it can cause some side effects like constipation or nausea. We’ll discuss those later.
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? And pills? This is just… great. Look, I don't want any lectures about diet. I eat fine. And I don’t want to spend my whole life in a doctor’s office. Just… give me the pills and let me go home. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a prescription for ferrous sulfate, 325mg, twice daily with food. It’s important to take it as directed, even if you don’t feel any different right away. It will take several weeks to see a noticeable improvement in your energy levels. And I recommend a follow-up appointment in six weeks to recheck your blood work and assess your progress. This pamphlet has more information about the condition and its treatment. Now, I understand your frustration, but addressing this anemia is important for your overall health. And if you experience any significant side effects from the iron supplement, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Six weeks. Just… great. No, I don't have any questions. Just… give me the prescription and let me go. Honestly, I'm wasting my whole day here. Thanks… I guess. Just… let me leave.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment on your way out. Get well soon, Hedy. .
