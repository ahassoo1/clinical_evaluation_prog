DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it’s about my… business. Down there. I noticed something wasn’t right. Blood, you see. In the… you know. Not a good sign, is it? Especially at my age. Things are supposed to slow down at my age, not… this.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly concerning to see changes like that, and you're right to get it checked out. Blood in the stool is always something we need to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate, eh? Like I said, not normal. It wasn’t a lot, mind you. Just… streaks. A couple of times now, over the last week or so. And it's… brighter than it ought to be, if you catch my drift. I eat plenty of fibre, always have. Not like these young folks, all processed rubbish. Still, it's concerning. I've seen things in my line of work, and this isn't a good colour. Not at all.
DOCTOR: You're very observant, and that’s good. The color is important. Bright red blood suggests it's likely coming from lower down in the digestive tract, which is helpful to know. “A couple of times over the last week” – would you say it's with every bowel movement, or just occasionally?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not every time. Definitely not. Like I said, a couple of times. Maybe… three times, now that I think on it. And it’s not a huge amount. Not enough to… well, you know. It just startled me, is all. I’ve always been regular, if you follow. This is a change. A bothersome change. And at my age, changes aren’t usually good.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Changes are more concerning as we get older. Just to be thorough, can you describe the stool itself when you don't see the blood?
PATIENT: Well, it's… solid. Usually. That's a good thing, isn’t it? Not… loose. Never been one for those troubles. Brown, naturally. A normal sort of brown, I suppose. Not pale, not dark, just… brown. Like it ought to be. I’ve always prided myself on a good digestive system. Years of eating right, you see. Though, this blood thing… throws a wrench in that, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Solid, normal brown stools most of the time is good information. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… strain, maybe. But I'm eighty-eight years old, doctor! Everything takes a bit more effort at this point. Not a sharp pain, not cramping, just… the usual effort. It’s not like it’s stopping me, if you follow. Just… a bit more push than I used to need. That's all.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. A little extra effort is common with age. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Still eat a good breakfast. Toast and eggs, usually. And a bit of dinner. Not as much as I used to, but that’s just getting older, isn’t it? Everything slows down. I'm not losing weight, not that I’ve seen. Still fit comfortably in my trousers, which is a good sign, I suppose. I wouldn't say my appetite's changed, exactly. Just… smaller portions.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No change in appetite or weight is helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Back in '62, I had a touch of pneumonia. Spent a week in the hospital. Nothing major. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a bit high, years ago. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn't like the way they made me feel. And… well, honestly, I’ve mostly been healthy my whole life. Knock on wood. I flew those planes for forty years, you know. Had to be in good shape.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in '62 and a history of high blood pressure. And you stopped taking medication for the blood pressure. Do you remember the name of the medication, or approximately how long you were on it?
PATIENT: Name of the medication? Goodness, no. That was… decades ago. Little blue pills, I think. Small ones. Took them for a couple of months, maybe. Didn't feel right, just sluggish. And the doctor kept wanting to adjust the dosage. Honestly, I just stopped. Figured I was better off without them. I've always been a bit skeptical of doctors, if you want the truth. Too quick to prescribe pills for everything. I managed fine on my own for years. It's not like I was critically ill, just a little high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism. Let's move on to surgeries. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Hmmm. Well, when I was a boy, I had my tonsils taken out. That was… ages ago, probably around 1940. And… Oh! And I had a bit of a mishap when I was flying over the Rockies. Broke my wrist. They set it, put it in a cast. That was back in '78, I think. Nothing major, healed up fine. Other than that… I don't recall any surgeries. I've been lucky, you see. Always careful, always looked after myself. Flying keeps you on your toes, you know. Can't afford to be careless.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture. And now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had a bit of trouble with her heart later in life. Ended up in the hospital a couple of times. And my brother, he had diabetes. Nasty business, diabetes. Always complaining about his feet. Other than that… not really. We weren't a particularly sickly family. Mostly just… tough people. Rugged stock, you know? Haida folk are built to last. Didn't spend much time at the doctor's office, if you catch my drift. Mostly dealt with things ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a one. I told you, I don't like taking pills. Waste of money, if you ask me. I get all the vitamins I need from my breakfast. Toast and eggs, plenty of protein. And a bit of fruit sometimes. No need for fancy supplements. I've always been a firm believer in a good, wholesome diet. Keeps you going. No need to complicate things with all these modern potions and pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've always been lucky in that regard. I've tried all sorts of things, over the years. Different foods, different fruits. Never had any trouble. I've always been a bit of an adventurous eater, if you catch my drift. Don’t mind trying new things. Never had a swollen tongue or anything like that. I think I'm just naturally immune to most things. Haida folk are a resilient bunch, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical exam, eh? Well, I suppose so. Can't hurt, I suppose. But don't go poking and prodding too much. I'm an old man, you know. Bones aren't as strong as they used to be. And I've got sensitive skin. Just be gentle, alright? I've had enough poking and prodding over the years, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll just take a look at your abdomen. I’ll also need to do a quick rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. It's a standard part of evaluating blood in the stool, and it will give me the best information possible. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a what now? You want to… poke around down there? Good heavens, doctor! At my age? I already told you about the blood, that's what I came in for. I don't see the need for any… invasive procedures. No, no, that's out of the question. Absolutely not. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not about to let you… Find another way, doctor. Surely there's another way.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. I wouldn’t suggest anything unless it was important for your health. The rectal exam is the best way to determine the source of the bleeding and rule out any serious problems, like polyps or other abnormalities. It's a quick exam, and I will be as careful and gentle as possible. However, if you are truly uncomfortable with it, we can discuss other options, such as a referral to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. A colonoscopy is more thorough, but it requires a bit more preparation and is a more involved procedure. Would you like me to explain the colonoscopy in more detail?
PATIENT: A… a colonoscopy? Now you’re talking about sticking a camera… where the sun doesn’t shine? Good heavens, doctor! I thought you were a medical professional, not a… a plumber! No, no, absolutely not. I came in here because of a little bit of blood, not to have my insides… investigated by a camera. I think I'll just… manage it myself, thank you very much. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not about to start having cameras shoved up… No. Absolutely not. Just… give me something for the indigestion, if you have anything. And I'll be on my way. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. I respect your wishes, and I won't proceed with either exam if you're not comfortable. However, I strongly advise against dismissing the blood in your stool, even if it's a small amount. It can be a sign of something serious, and delaying diagnosis could lead to complications. Since you're declining both a physical exam and a colonoscopy, I’m limited in what I can do for you here today. I can prescribe something for the indigestion, as you requested, but I highly recommend you see a gastroenterologist for a proper evaluation. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: A referral, eh? To another doctor who'll want to… poke and prod? Honestly. Alright, alright. Give me the referral. But don't expect me to go running off to see them. I'll think about it. And the indigestion medicine, yes. Something strong. I'm a stubborn old man, doctor. I know what I'm doing. I’ve lived eighty-eight years without cameras up… well, you know. But… alright. Referral and indigestion medicine. That’s all. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm printing the referral to Dr. Evelyn Grant, a highly-respected gastroenterologist in the region. She’s very thorough and compassionate, and I believe she’ll take good care of you. Here you are. I’m also writing a prescription for Omeprazole 20mg, to be taken once daily for two weeks, for the indigestion. Please take it as directed. And I strongly encourage you to schedule an appointment with Dr. Grant as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… this is a waste of time, if you ask me. But thank you, doctor. I suppose. I’ll… consider it. Good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or change your mind about the referral. Take care of yourself. .
