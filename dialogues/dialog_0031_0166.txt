DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Rakosky. The pleasure is all mine. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become persistent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It started a few weeks ago, I believe, though pinning down the exact date is difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Tarin. Numbness can be concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. When you say “a few weeks ago,” can you recall roughly how many weeks?
PATIENT: Approximately four weeks, Doctor. Perhaps a little longer. It began gradually, a slight tingling, really. I initially dismissed it as perhaps sleeping on it wrong, or straining it during a hike. But it hasn't fully resolved, and now it's… more constant. It's primarily in my left leg, from the thigh down to my foot.
DOCTOR: Alright, four weeks and gradually worsening. That gives us a good starting point. You mentioned it's in your left leg, thigh down to your foot. Is the numbness constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It varies, Doctor. It's not completely constant. There are times, particularly when I'm actively working – animating, or setting up a shot – that I don't notice it at all. It’s more pronounced when I'm resting, or trying to sleep. And it seems to worsen after I've been on my feet for an extended period. I'm a special effects artist, so I do quite a bit of walking around on set.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more noticeable at rest and after prolonged standing or walking. That’s helpful information. And you’re a special effects artist – that involves quite a bit of physical activity, as you mentioned. Can you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: It's… not exactly pain, Doctor. Though sometimes there's a faint ache accompanying it. It’s more like a… loss of feeling. A sort of… dullness. Like my leg isn’t entirely there. Occasionally, I’ll experience a pins-and-needles sensation, but that's intermittent. Mostly it's just a lack of normal sensation, a heaviness, perhaps. It’s hard to articulate precisely. It doesn't feel like an injury, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dullness and heaviness, sometimes with pins and needles – and no pain, or only a faint ache. And you don’t feel like it’s related to an injury. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As far as I'm aware, my medical history is unremarkable. I've had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox – but nothing major. No broken bones, no surgeries. I maintain private insurance, and have had a yearly physical with my general practitioner, Dr. Olsen, for the past five years. She's always said I’m in good health, generally. No chronic conditions, no allergies, nothing of that nature. I am Yupik, and while there’s some family history of diabetes on my mother’s side, I do not have it myself; I was tested a few years ago.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Tarin. Yearly physicals and no significant medical history are encouraging. Family history of diabetes is worth noting, and it’s good you’ve been tested. You mentioned you don't have any allergies, and no current medications, correct?
PATIENT: Correct, Doctor. No allergies, and I currently take no medications. Just a standard multivitamin, occasionally, but nothing prescribed or regular. I eat a fairly balanced diet, though admittedly, working long hours on set sometimes means resorting to quicker options. I attempt to stay physically active when my schedule allows, but it's not always consistent. I haven’t smoked or consumed alcohol in several years, and have never used recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very helpful information, thank you. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your reflexes and sensation in both legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Absolutely, Doctor. Please proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this numbness. I understand that a physical examination is necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, your reflexes are… slightly diminished on the left side, compared to the right, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs with this cotton ball. Please tell me when you feel it, and the level of sensation – whether it's sharp, dull, or if you feel it at all. We’ll start with your thighs… How does that feel compared to the right leg?
PATIENT: The sensation on my left thigh feels…slightly muted compared to the right. It's not a complete loss of feeling, but it's noticeably less sharp. It feels…distant, if that makes sense. Like I’m perceiving it through a layer of cotton, perhaps. I can definitely feel it when you touch me, but it isn't as crisp or immediate as it is on my right leg. I don't experience any pain or discomfort with the touch.
DOCTOR: Alright, and as we move down to your calves and feet, the difference in sensation becomes a little more pronounced. It appears your sensation is somewhat reduced along the outer aspect of your left lower leg and foot. Can you feel this difference yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. As you move lower down, the difference becomes significantly more noticeable. It’s… unsettling, actually. It's not a complete numbness, but it feels… absent, or diminished. Especially along the outer side of my lower leg and foot, as you mentioned. It’s like a band of… lessened perception. It feels quite different from my right leg, which feels completely normal. I hadn’t quite realized how much of a contrast there was until you pointed it out and I focused on it. It’s… worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Tarin. It's good that you’re aware of the differences. Your strength seems normal, thankfully, but the decreased sensation is something we need to investigate further. Based on what you’ve described and the physical examination, it sounds like we may be dealing with a nerve compression issue, potentially related to the sciatic nerve. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order an MRI of your lower back and left leg to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine the cause of this, then certainly. I’m happy to proceed with that. A nerve compression issue… is that something serious? I’m not terribly familiar with those terms, to be honest. If you wouldn't mind explaining that briefly, I would appreciate it. I am, admittedly, somewhat anxious about this, though I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Tarin. It's natural to feel concerned when something isn’t right. A nerve compression issue, often referred to as neuropathy, means that a nerve is being squeezed or irritated. This can happen for a variety of reasons – a herniated disc in your back, muscle spasms, or even just inflammation. The MRI will allow us to visualize the nerves and surrounding structures, helping us pinpoint the exact source of the compression, if there is one. It's not always serious. Sometimes, it can be managed with physical therapy, medication, or lifestyle changes. However, it’s important to identify the cause to ensure we provide the appropriate treatment. The radiologist will interpret the MRI, and we'll discuss the results together. We’ll then formulate a plan of action based on the findings. In the meantime, I’m going to write an order for the MRI. Do you have any preferences for where you’d like to have it done?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor, that explanation is very helpful and… reassuring, actually. Knowing that it's not necessarily a dire situation eases my mind somewhat. As for the MRI location, I don't have a specific preference. The clinic recommended Anchorage Imaging, I believe, when I initially scheduled my appointment. If that's convenient for you, then I’m happy to go there. Otherwise, whichever facility is most efficient and offers timely results would be acceptable. I’m not particularly familiar with the options in the area.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Anchorage Imaging is a good facility, and we use them frequently. I will send the MRI order electronically to them, and they will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. They typically have good availability within the next week. Okay, the order has been sent. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen – if you experience any discomfort. And try to avoid activities that exacerbate the numbness, if possible. We will also schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately two weeks, once the MRI results are available, to discuss them and formulate a long-term plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I’ll obtain some ibuprofen, and I will attempt to limit activities that worsen the numbness. I will be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks, as you recommend. Thank you for your thorough examination and clear explanation, Doctor Rakosky. I feel considerably less anxious now, and I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any symptoms I should watch out for, before my follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. Before your follow-up appointment, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any of the following, contact the clinic immediately: severe pain, weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or numbness that spreads to other parts of your body. These could indicate a more serious issue requiring immediate attention. Otherwise, focus on managing your symptoms and avoiding activities that aggravate the numbness. Do you have any further questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that covers everything. I believe I’ve asked all of my questions, and you’ve addressed all of my concerns. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I look forward to receiving the MRI results and discussing them with you in two weeks. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patient demeanor. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Tarin. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. .
