DOCTOR: Bula and hello! I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you, Kandy. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble, you see. It’s getting harder to… to go. Like it takes effort, and sometimes it just doesn't want to. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with your urination – it takes effort, and sometimes you can't go easily. And this has been happening for a few weeks. That’s good information to start with. Let me just pull up your record here… Alright, Kandy Yadao, 66 years old. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sixty-six. Lithuanian, if that matters. It doesn't hurt, exactly, not like a sharp pain. It’s just… weak, like the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be. And I find myself having to push a bit more. I don't go very often, usually only three or four times a day, and I drink a good amount of water, so it’s not like I'm dehydrated or anything. I’ve always been regular, you see, and this is just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not painful, but a weak stream, needing to push, and this is a change from your usual pattern of three or four times a day – even though you drink plenty of water. That's helpful. And you said this is fairly new, over the last few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe four or five? It wasn’t sudden, it sort of crept up on me. I thought it might just be… well, you know, getting older. But it’s not getting better, and sometimes I worry a little. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly. And I don't want it to turn into something worse. I have a friend, Elsie, and she had trouble with this, and it ended up being… well, it was a bit of a bother for her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially hearing about Elsie. It's good you're getting it checked out. It's always best to rule things out. Now, apart from the change in your urination, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no pain in my back, not really. I have been a little more tired lately, but that could be anything, really. I do get a bit winded walking up the stairs, but I've always been a bit breathless. Oh! And sometimes I feel like I haven't quite emptied my bladder all the way, you know? Like there’s a little bit left, even after I’ve gone. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, no fever or back pain, a little more tired than usual, and feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder sometimes. Okay. And just to get a fuller picture, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… no, not really. Everything is pretty normal down there, if you don’t mind me saying so. A little constipation sometimes, but nothing major. I eat plenty of fruit, you know, and drink lots of water. Like I said, I try to stay regular. It's the other end that’s been the bother, not this one. Though, now that I think about it, I have been getting up once in the night to go to the bathroom, which I didn’t used to do. Just the once, usually. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, so bowel habits are generally normal with some occasional constipation, and you've started getting up once at night to urinate, which is new. That's important information. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any health problems that you’ve been diagnosed with – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a small pill for that, every day. And I had a bit of trouble with my cholesterol, but that's under control now with diet, mostly. I don’t have diabetes, I don’t think. No, I’ve never been told I do. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, when I was younger, but that was a long time ago, and I haven’t had any problems with that since. And… let me think… Oh! And I have arthritis in my hands, it gets a bit sore sometimes, but it’s nothing too serious. I take some over-the-counter pain relief when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have high blood pressure managed with medication, history of high cholesterol now controlled with diet, a hysterectomy many years ago without complications, and arthritis in your hands. And you're taking over-the-counter pain relief for that. That's very helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, and I've taken plenty of pills over the years for little aches and pains, and never had a problem. I’m pretty good that way, I think. Nothing I’m allergic to. I don't wear any fancy perfumes or anything either, so it’s not like I’ve ever had a skin reaction to anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Kandy, this is all very helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and I’ll also do a quick neurological assessment. And then I’d like to do a urine test to check for any infection or other problems. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A urine test sounds sensible, and I don't mind the exam. Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I have to get back and make lunch for my cat, Winston, you see. He gets terribly cross if I’m late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as quick as we can, and Winston sounds like a very important patient! Okay, let’s start by listening to your abdomen. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’ll just put this gown on you for modesty. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen here… Does that cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little pressure, but no pain. It feels… normal, I suppose. Like when the doctor checks my tummy every year. No, it’s fine. You can press as much as you need to. I just want to get this sorted, you see, and if pressing helps you figure it out, go right ahead. I trust you're a good doctor. My Elsie recommended you, you know. She said you were very thorough.
DOCTOR: That's very kind of Elsie! I'm glad she sent you my way. Okay, everything feels normal so far. Now, let’s just check your reflexes. I’m just going to tap lightly on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This is just to see how your nerves are functioning. Okay, good reflexes here. Everything seems to be working normally. Alright, the last part of the exam will be a urine sample. I'll leave you some privacy to collect that. Just try to collect at least a couple of ounces, and then I’ll send it off to the lab for testing. I'll be right outside when you're finished. Here’s a cup, and I’ll show you where the restroom is.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A urine sample. That sounds sensible. Thank you, Doctor. I know where the restroom is. It’s just down the hall, isn’t it? I’ll be back in a few minutes with the sample. Hopefully, it will tell you what's going on. I’m getting a bit chilly in here, though. Is it possible to turn up the heating a little? It’s a bit drafty.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let me just adjust the thermostat here… There we go, that should help warm things up a bit. Yes, just down the hall to your right. Take your time, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Don’t hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I won't be long.
DOCTOR: 66-year-old Lithuanian female, presenting with obstructive urinary symptoms… rule out infection, assess for BPH, consider referral if no improvement…
