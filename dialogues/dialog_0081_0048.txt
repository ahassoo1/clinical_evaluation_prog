DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my wife who really insisted I come. She says I’ve been a bit…scattered lately. Not remembering where I put things, asking the same questions twice. It’s not that bad, you understand. I just… get distracted sometimes. It’s probably nothing, honestly. I still lay tile better than anyone in three counties.
DOCTOR: I see. “Scattered” and repeating questions, you say. And this is concerning your wife, primarily?
PATIENT: Well, she worries. Always has. A good woman, my Srey. But she exaggerates. It’s not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. It's more like... I’ll start a sentence, then forget what I was going to say. Or I’ll ask where I left my tape measure, and then find it five minutes later right where it always is. Small things. Really.
DOCTOR: Right. “Small things.” And how long has this been going on, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… maybe six months now? Hard to say exactly. It’s come and gone, you see. Some days I'm perfectly clear, other days… not so much. It started around the time the new neighbors moved in, I think. All that commotion disrupted my routine. I need a good routine, you understand? Everything has a place.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you attribute it to a disruption in routine?
PATIENT: Well, it makes sense, doesn’t it? I've been laying tile for forty years. Forty years! You get used to things being… orderly. When things change, it throws me off. Not that I’m blaming the neighbors, exactly. Just saying… it’s a factor. A significant factor. And honestly, I'm not a young man anymore. Things slow down.
DOCTOR: I understand. While routine is important, changes over six months can be more than simply an adjustment period. Let's talk a bit about how this is affecting your daily life, beyond misplacing a tape measure. Are you having any difficulty with tasks you've always been able to perform easily?
PATIENT: Tasks? No, not really. I still go to work every day. I still finish the jobs. I might take a bit longer on the more complicated patterns, need to double-check my measurements… but I get it done. Srey does most of the cooking these days, always has been better at that than me. She says I've gotten… slower with the finances, but I’ve always let her handle most of that. It's just… little things. It's not like I can't do things, it’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes. And are you experiencing any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Mood? What do you mean? I get annoyed when I forget things, naturally. Anyone would. And I’m not as patient as I used to be, Srey says. But I always been a bit… particular. I wouldn’t say my mood has changed. Just… more easily irritated, maybe. A little quicker to snap at Srey, and then I feel bad about it. It’s a cycle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any difficulties with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to. I wake up a couple times a night. Usually just to go to the bathroom. Or sometimes, I just… lie awake thinking. Thinking about the jobs I have to do, or something Srey said. Nothing major. Most old men have trouble sleeping, wouldn’t you say? It's just part of getting older.
DOCTOR: It is common, Mr. Lason, but we still need to investigate. Now, let’s move onto some medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure’s been a little high for years now. Take a pill for that. And my knees aren't what they used to be, years of being on them laying tile. Get some shots for that every few months. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Never broken a bone, haven't been in the hospital for anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee issues. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always avoided them if I could. My father used to say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I’ve always been one to tough things out. A little pain never killed anyone. Besides, I don't trust doctors to poke around inside of me. No offense, of course.
DOCTOR: None taken, Mr. Lason. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother lived to be 85, fairly healthy until the very end. My father died of a heart attack when he was 68. He worked very hard his whole life. My brother, he’s got some trouble with his memory now. Not sure what it is, something the doctors told him, but it sounds serious. He’s living in a home now, down in Fresno. Sad, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal grandmother lived to 85, paternal father died of a heart attack, and your brother has memory issues. That is…relevant. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Srey always asks when I get a new prescription, but I’ve never had a reaction. I can eat anything, don’t get stung by bees… nothing like that. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Don't need much to make me happy, or sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sometimes I take something for my knees, the shots I told you about. And Srey gives me a vitamin every morning, says I need it to keep my strength up. But no pills, other than the blood pressure one. I try to avoid taking too many things, you understand? Everything has a side effect these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I think it’s time we do a brief physical exam and possibly some lab work, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will include checking your reflexes, balance, and basic cognitive function. I understand your skepticism, but these are standard procedures to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Cognitive function? What’s that even mean? You’re going to give me a test? Like in school? Look, I already told you, I’m just a little forgetful sometimes. My wife worries too much. I don't like the sound of a test, doctor. And all that poking and prodding… I’m not sure I want to go through all that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it’s not a “test” in the way you’re thinking. It's a series of simple questions and observations to assess your memory and thinking skills. It will help us determine if there's a medical cause for your symptoms and whether further evaluation is needed. It's a standard part of a medical workup, and it’s not about judgment, it’s about identifying potential problems. I assure you, it will be quick and non-invasive. If you are unwilling to allow a basic neurological examination, I cannot provide you with an accurate assessment of your condition. It’s simply unethical to proceed without it. Are you willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Unethical, you say? Well, I don't like being told what’s ethical or not. But… my wife will be furious if I don’t at least try. She's been reading things online, all sorts of terrible possibilities. Fine. But quick, you hear me? And no poking. Just… ask your questions. But I’m telling you, it’s probably nothing. Just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. Let's begin. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… August… let me see… the 2nd. Yes. August the 2nd. 2025, isn't it? Srey always keeps track of these things. I try to remember, but... it slips my mind sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what city are we in currently?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… that’s easy. We’re in… Bakersfield, aren't we? Small town. Not much happens here. Srey likes it quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me, and I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. I said them. Hopefully, I’ll remember them. Srey’s always telling me I need to focus.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Spell… world… backwards? Hmm… That’s a tricky one. Let me see… d-l-r-o-w? No, wait… d-l-r-o-w-l? No… This is harder than it looks.
DOCTOR: That's alright, take your time. Just do the best you can. Now, can you explain to me why you are here today?
PATIENT: I just told you! My wife thinks I'm…scattered. Forgetting things, asking the same questions. She worries too much. So she makes me come here, for you to poke and prod and ask silly questions. I'm here because she's worried, and I’m tired of explaining it!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. And now, can you repeat the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words… apple… hmm… something with wood… table! Yes, table. And… something small and shiny… Oh dear. It’s on the tip of my tongue… a coin? No… I can’t quite…
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you draw a clock, setting the hands to 10:10?
PATIENT: There. That's a clock. Ten-ten. Srey always draws much neater ones. But I'm a tile setter, not an artist!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you. I have enough information for now. Based on this brief assessment, and your reported symptoms, there is some indication of cognitive impairment. However, this could be due to a variety of factors, including age, stress, or underlying medical conditions. It is important to rule out any treatable causes. I recommend a full neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain, and blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid function. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive assessment. Would you like me to schedule those appointments for you?
PATIENT: MRI… blood work… more appointments… Srey is going to be thrilled. Look, I don’t like all this poking and prodding. Is it really necessary? Can’t I just… try to remember things better? Maybe take some vitamins? It sounds expensive, too. Honestly, I think it’s just old age. Fine. If it will make her happy… schedule the appointments. But I’m warning you, I’m not optimistic. And I still think it’s just a waste of time and money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns. I will schedule a neurological consultation with Dr. Ramirez, and arrange for an MRI of the brain and a comprehensive blood panel. The neurologist will be able to provide you with a more detailed explanation of the findings and recommend appropriate treatment options if needed. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage, but we will assist you with any necessary pre-authorization paperwork. I will also provide you with a referral for cognitive therapy, which may help with memory and concentration. Here is a list of the appointments and contact information. In the meantime, please continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. I also recommend maintaining a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, as these can both help improve cognitive function. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It all sounds very complicated. I guess… I guess just try to remember the appointments. And tell Srey I tried. That’s all I can do. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Lason. We will follow up with you to ensure everything is scheduled smoothly. And please remember, early detection is key. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact our office immediately. Here's a copy of your after-visit summary. Have a good day, Mr. Lason. And I encourage you to discuss these concerns with Srey.
