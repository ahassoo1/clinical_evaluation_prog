DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… somewhere in my chest, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say exactly where. It just… aches when I breathe deep. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A while ago, I guess. I just figured it would go away.
DOCTOR: Okay. Aches with deep breaths… and you’ve had this for a while. Not a sudden pain, more gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Not like a sharp thing, you know? Just… a dull ache. It’s not constant, either. It comes and goes. Mostly when I try to take a really big breath. Like when I’m… lifting something heavy, maybe. Or climbing stairs. Things like that. I don’t… I don’t really do much climbing these days though. But that’s when I notice it, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it's related to exertion, like lifting or climbing… and it’s a dull ache, not sharp. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not that I can recall. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m eighty years old, Doctor! I get tired easily. No coughing, no… what do you call it… shortness of breath, except when I’m really pushing myself. No fever. Just the pain. I really don’t remember anything else being different. It's all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cough, no shortness of breath except with heavy exertion. And the tiredness… well, that’s understandable. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. I think… I think I had high blood pressure, once. A long time ago. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and they made me feel… strange. Other than that… not that I remember. I’ve broken a bone or two in my life, working construction, but that was all ages ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication you stopped taking. And some old broken bones from construction work. That’s helpful. Any surgeries, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I don't think so. No, no surgeries. Not that I recall. Maybe… maybe I had my appendix out when I was a boy? But I honestly can't remember. It was a long, long time ago. My memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I apologize. Is this… is this going to take long? I have… things I need to do.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll go as quickly as we can. No surgeries that you’re aware of. And you said you stopped taking the blood pressure medication because it made you feel strange - can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Strange… hmm. It was… dizzy, I think. And tired. Just… not right. Everything felt a little… fuzzy, like I do now sometimes. It wasn’t a terrible feeling, but it wasn’t pleasant, either. And the doctor said it would take a long time to see any difference, and I didn’t feel any different, so I just… stopped. I know, I know, I shouldn’t have. But I was younger then, and… well, I didn't think it mattered much. Honestly, I probably just wanted to get off the pills. They were a nuisance. Is this important, Doctor? We’re talking about a long time ago, aren’t we?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Ruocco. It gives me some context. Okay, so dizziness and fatigue with the medication, which led you to discontinue it. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had heart problems, lung problems, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tough one. My wife… she passed away a long time ago. And I haven't seen my children in… well, a long time. I don’t really know much about their health. My parents… they both died when I was young. I think my father had… something with his heart, maybe? But I was just a boy then, and I don’t remember the details. Everyone in my family was… tough. Worked hard, didn't complain much. They didn't talk about their health, you know? It just wasn't something we did. Does that help? I’m sorry I can’t be more useful.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history, father possibly had heart problems. That’s alright. Now, a couple quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Not even a puff. My wife… she hated it. And I didn't want to upset her. Always thought it was a foolish habit, anyway. Never touched the stuff. And I don’t drink much either. A beer now and then, with dinner, maybe. But nothing regular. I’ve always tried to stay in decent shape, considering my work. Hard labor keeps you moving, you know? Although, I don’t get around as much these days. Everything aches, even without the pain in my chest. Is this… are we getting closer to figuring out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional beer. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’ve taken a lot of pills in my life, working construction – pain relievers, antibiotics… never had any trouble. I eat pretty much anything. My wife was the picky eater, not me. She wouldn’t eat anything green. But me? I'll try anything once. Honestly, Doctor, I’m drawing a blank. Everything feels… fuzzy. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? This is a long time ago, a lot of different things happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Ruocco, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check things out. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick? I have… things I need to get to. It’s just… sitting here makes me a little anxious. The sooner we figure this out, the better. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Take nice, deep breaths for me, when I tell you. Okay… heart sounds are a little diminished, but regular rhythm. No murmurs that I detect. Lung sounds… a little decreased at the bases, but clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Alright. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Ouch. Yes, that’s… a little tender. Right about… here. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It feels… like a bruise, almost. But I don’t remember hitting myself or anything. Is that bad? It’s not terrible, but… it’s there. It’s been there for a while, I think. The same pain as when I take a deep breath. Is this… what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, definitely tenderness with palpation on the left side of your chest. Not a lot of crepitus. It doesn’t feel like anything acutely broken, but it’s certainly sore to the touch. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated. Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing now, I suspect this might be costochondritis. It’s an inflammation of the cartilage in your chest wall. It's often caused by strain or injury, or sometimes just happens on its own. The tenderness and pain with deep breaths are common symptoms. It's not usually serious, but it can be quite painful. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Costo… what did you call it? Inflammation… Strain or injury… I’ve had a lot of strain and injury in my life, working construction. Lifting heavy things, falling… twisting my back… yes, I suppose that could be it. The pain does feel better when I sit still. And worse when I move. It just… worried me because it felt like it was in my chest. I always worry about my heart. So it’s not my heart? Is that what you’re saying? That’s… a relief. What do we do about it? Is there a pill I can take? Because honestly, Doctor, I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, the chances of it being your heart are low, but we'll keep an eye on things. Costochondritis is the most likely explanation. There's no specific pill to "cure" it, unfortunately. We can manage the pain with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. You can also try applying heat or ice to the area. Most importantly, avoid activities that aggravate the pain. I'm going to recommend you take ibuprofen 600mg three times a day for a week and see if that helps. If the pain doesn't improve after a week, or if it gets worse, please come back and see me. We can consider other options then, like physical therapy or, rarely, stronger medications. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… yes, I think I have some of that at home. 600mg… three times a day. And avoid activities… I can do that. I don’t do much anymore, anyway. So, just rest and take the pills. That doesn’t sound too bad. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything I should be worried about? And… how much does this visit cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know. It’s just… everything’s so expensive these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. The main thing to be worried about is if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or if the pain suddenly becomes much worse. Those could be signs of something more serious. As for the cost of the visit, let me check with the billing department for you. Because you are uninsured, we do offer a sliding scale fee based on your income. I'll have the receptionist look into that for you before you leave. It shouldn't be too expensive, and we can work something out if needed. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For not thinking it was my heart. And for not making me take a lot of pills. And for being patient with an old man who can’t remember things. I appreciate it. Tell the receptionist to take her time with the bill. I’m not in a hurry. Just… as long as it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Okay, then. I guess I’ll be going now. Thank you again, Doctor Chora. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. Take it easy, and don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns. We'll get the billing sorted out for you. .
