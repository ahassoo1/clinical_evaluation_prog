DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Right, well, it’s a bit… unusual, to be honest. I’ve just been so thirsty lately, and hungry, no matter how much I eat. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become a bit disruptive, if I’m being frank. I'd like to get it sorted if possible, as I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is good to know. A few weeks of increased thirst and hunger… alright. Can you tell me a little more about the thirst?
PATIENT: Well, I’m constantly reaching for a drink. Water, juice, anything, really. It doesn’t quite quench it, if that makes sense. I find myself drinking much more than usual, and I’m still parched. Even at night, I'm waking up needing a glass of water. It's… inconvenient, to put it mildly. I don't recall anything changing that would cause this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, constantly reaching for fluids, not feeling fully quenched, waking up at night… that does sound significant. And you said this has been happening for several weeks now?
PATIENT: Yes, several weeks. Perhaps six, maybe eight? It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. It wasn’t a sudden thing, just… gradually getting worse. I suppose I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I was just dehydrated from the weather, but it hasn’t gone away. As I said, it's disrupting things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the hunger – is that constant as well, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, yes. I eat a normal-sized meal, and not long after, I’m feeling hungry again. I’ve even started snacking between meals, which I never used to do. I'm eating more than I normally would, but it doesn't seem to help much. It’s not… cravings, exactly. Just a general feeling of emptiness, if you follow.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant thirst and constant hunger, increasing over six to eight weeks. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – needing to go more often, or larger volumes?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I suppose I have been going to the bathroom more often. I hadn’t really connected the two, but… yes. And perhaps… a bit more volume each time, if you understand what I mean. I thought it was just because of the amount I’m drinking, to be honest. I didn't think it was a separate issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination… Okay. Let’s get a little bit of your medical background. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, touch wood. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. No ongoing illnesses, no major surgeries… I take a daily multivitamin, but that’s about it. My ex-wife was always the one who kept track of these things. I'm divorced, you see. Perhaps she would have remembered something. But I'm reasonably fit, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant medical history. Any family history of diabetes, kidney problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. My mother had some sort of… ailment when she was older, but I never really paid much attention to the details. I was quite young when she passed, and my father wasn't one for discussing medical matters. He was a stoic sort. I don’t recall anyone having kidney problems, no. But I wouldn’t swear to it. It’s not something that was ever openly discussed in my family, if that makes sense. I apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: Alright, it’s alright. Family history can be difficult to track. Okay, and just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements, besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the multivitamin, as I said. I rarely take anything, even for a headache. I prefer to just… power through. I'm not one for fussing over minor ailments, if I can avoid it. I really just want to figure out what's causing this thirst and hunger, and get it sorted out. I have a lot to do, and this is rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no medications, no significant medical history, and a somewhat unclear family history. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It'll just involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. And I'll do a quick check of your skin, just to assess your hydration level. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I suppose it’s necessary. I’d rather get this sorted as quickly as possible. Please, go ahead. I'll try to remain as still as possible. It's just... I have a meeting later this afternoon, and I'm already running slightly behind schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing alarming. Pulse is normal. Heart and lungs sound clear. Skin turgor seems slightly diminished… meaning you’re a little dehydrated. That's consistent with your increased thirst. Okay. I’m going to order a blood glucose test and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. We should have results back fairly quickly. Just a routine precaution, to rule things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Routine precautions are fine by me. The quicker we can get to the bottom of this, the better. A blood glucose test and a check of my kidney function... good. Will I need to fast for this test? I have that meeting this afternoon, and I hadn’t planned on skipping lunch.
DOCTOR: You do not need to fast. The tests don’t require it. We’ll just take a sample now, and you can go about your day. The nurse will just take a small amount of blood from your arm. It'll be quick and relatively painless. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Alright?
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. No fasting is… excellent news. I appreciate that. And a quick test is precisely what I was hoping for. Yes, I’m quite ready when the nurse is prepared. Please, proceed. I really must get back to work later this afternoon, and I’d like to be able to focus on that meeting, rather than worrying about this thirst and hunger.
DOCTOR: Alright. While we're waiting for the results, it's important to stay hydrated. Continue drinking fluids, but try to avoid sugary drinks. Water is best. And if you notice any other symptoms – like blurred vision, frequent infections, or unexplained weight loss – please let me know immediately. The nurse will let me know as soon as the results are available. It should only be a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, water it is. I’ll avoid the sugary drinks. And I will certainly keep you informed of any new developments. Blurred vision, frequent infections… right. I haven't noticed anything like that yet, thankfully. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. I am rather anxious to get back to normal, if you don't mind my saying so. .
