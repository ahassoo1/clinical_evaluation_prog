DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. Well, it's… paperwork, mostly. Something about time off, I think? My wife, bless her heart, she said I need to get some forms filled out. For… the work, and maybe… something else? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I’m Ronnald, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ronnald, I understand. Paperwork can be… cumbersome. And it’s perfectly alright if details are unclear. We can certainly sort through this together. To clarify, is this related to a specific health concern, or is it simply for routine documentation regarding time off from work?
PATIENT: Hmm… a health concern… not exactly, I don’t think. It’s… well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, maybe a little more than usual. And my memory hasn’t been the best, as you can probably tell! But it's not like a sickness or anything. Mostly just… getting older, I suppose. It’s for my job, Directors, Religious Activities… yes, that’s it. My wife handles most of the details, so I'm not always sure what exactly needs doing.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue and some memory difficulties. And this is related to documentation for your position at Directors, Religious Activities?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. I think it has something to do with being able to take some time… off, if I need it. Or maybe, if I can't do everything? Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. My wife said something about FMLA… does that ring a bell? She said that might be important.
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA – the Family and Medical Leave Act. That's a possibility, certainly. It requires documentation of a medical need. To be thorough, Mr. Limtiaco, let's explore this fatigue and memory concern a bit further. Could you describe the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m sick in bed, you understand? It’s just… a constant tiredness, like I haven’t slept enough. Even when I have slept. It makes it hard to concentrate, sometimes. And I forget things… little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I was just saying… things like that. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know, a few months maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. It just feels… like my brain is a little slow, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. A constant fatigue for several months, accompanied by some memory difficulties. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. My wife says I’ve been a little more… irritable, maybe? Not angry, just… quicker to frustration, I suppose. And sometimes I have trouble finding the right words, like they’re on the tip of my tongue but I can't quite grab them. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's noticeable. Oh, and I haven’t been sleeping as soundly as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Irritability, difficulty with word-finding, and disrupted sleep… yes, that's helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical problems… Oh, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a very long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. Nothing serious, really. I've generally been a very healthy man, thankfully. But… My wife says my blood pressure has been a little high lately, but I haven’t been to the doctor about it specifically. She monitors it at home, mostly. That’s about it, I think. It’s hard to remember everything!
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy, a fractured arm in the past, and elevated blood pressure monitored at home. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Well, my wife gives me some vitamins every morning. Just… general health vitamins, I think. Nothing prescribed, just… over-the-counter. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I’ll take some… what are they called… ibuprofen? For the aches and pains. But that's it. Really. I don’t take any regular medication.
DOCTOR: Alright. Vitamins and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of, no. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always checks labels, just in case, but I've never had to worry about allergies. No, none at all, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Limtiaco, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a simple neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know what I need to do. Blood pressure… heart and lungs… neurological assessment… sounds good to me. Let's get to it!
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just step over here and have a seat. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I’m following it. Like this? Is this okay? It feels a little strange, to be honest. I’m trying my best to keep my head perfectly still… it's a little hard, though. I sometimes have trouble with… coordination, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, if you could stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment. Okay, that’s good. Now, just walk a few steps for me, nice and slow. Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That was helpful.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, walking… like this? It feels a little awkward, to be honest. My wife has been saying I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be. Maybe it's just getting older, you know? I try to walk normally, but… it doesn't always feel easy. I hope I'm not doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: No, you're not doing anything wrong, Mr. Limtiaco. This is all very helpful information. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we should consider. The fatigue, memory difficulties, irritability, and changes in gait and balance could be related to several things, including normal age-related changes, but also possibly mild cognitive impairment, vitamin deficiencies, or underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. I would also like to discuss the possibility of a simple cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… cognitive assessment… yes, I suppose so. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It’s just… I don’t want to be a bother. And honestly, the thought of something being… wrong… is a little frightening. But I trust your judgement. If those tests will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, let’s do them. What kind of cognitive assessment are we talking about? Is it… difficult?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel anxious, Mr. Limtiaco. We're simply gathering information to understand what's going on and ensure you receive the best possible care. The cognitive assessment is a series of simple questions and tasks designed to evaluate your memory, attention, and thinking skills. It's not a difficult test, and it's usually completed within 30-45 minutes. It's more like a conversation than an exam. The blood tests will give us information on potential vitamin deficiencies or other underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. I'll write the orders for both the blood tests and the cognitive assessment now. And in the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home as your wife has been doing. Are there any questions you have at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just… simple questions, and blood tests. And keep monitoring my blood pressure. Okay. Yes, one question. Will the results take long to come back? And… if something is wrong, what happens next?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The blood test results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. The cognitive assessment results will be available a bit sooner, usually within 24-48 hours. If the tests reveal any abnormalities, we'll discuss the findings in detail and develop a treatment plan together. This might involve lifestyle changes, medication, or referral to a specialist, depending on the specific condition. I want to assure you that we will address any concerns you have every step of the way. We will also discuss and rule out other possible conditions. In the meantime, I’m going to print out the orders for the blood tests and cognitive assessment. I’ll also provide you with a list of instructions for the blood tests. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. My wife will be glad to hear we have a plan. I think I’ll go home now and take it easy. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now to discuss the results of the tests. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
