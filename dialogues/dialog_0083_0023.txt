DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest... it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s like… a dull ache, mostly. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? It's hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your chest for several weeks. I understand. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like… a sharp pain. More like when you use your muscles too much, you know? Like after carrying heavy things. But I haven't been carrying anything heavy. It’s both sides, not just one spot. And sometimes… I think it feels worse before my wife and I… you know… sleep. But not every time. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds like it's not a typical sharp, stabbing pain, but more of a muscular ache that’s somewhat intermittent. And you've noticed it can be worse before bedtime. Okay. To clarify, when you say it's worse before bedtime, does that mean it happens as you're trying to fall asleep, or is it just that you notice it more then?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. I think… I notice it more when I lie down. When I’m just relaxing in bed. It doesn't hurt while I'm trying to sleep, not always. Just when I first get into bed, and I'm lying there. I don't know if that makes any difference. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So it seems to be triggered or worsened by lying down. And you mentioned it happens on both sides of your chest. Does anything else make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Not really, I don't think so. Sitting doesn’t make it worse, and standing doesn't make it better. Maybe… maybe if I move around a little, it feels okay for a few minutes. But it always comes back. I haven't taken anything for it. I didn’t really think it was… serious, you know? Just a little pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're bringing it to my attention now. Even if it doesn’t seem serious, it’s best to investigate. Could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… medical history? I don't really have much, I think. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. Maybe five years? I don't remember. I’ve never had any big problems, like heart trouble or anything. Just… colds sometimes. My wife, she keeps telling me I need to go more often! I work on roofs, so I get a few bumps and bruises, but that’s it. I don't take any pills, and I’m not allergic to anything I know of. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No major medical issues, haven’t been to the doctor in five years, no medications or allergies. Given your occupation—working on roofs—and the chest pain you're experiencing, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That will help me assess what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. I guess that makes sense. Working on roofs is hard work. I'm used to getting checked for bumps and stuff. What will you do? Just… listening to my chest? I'm not afraid, Doctor. Just curious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Yes, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I’ll also feel your chest to check for any tenderness or unusual sensations. I'll also take your blood pressure and pulse. It's a fairly straightforward exam. If you could please lie down on the table, we can get started. I’ll try to be as quick as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Here I am. Should I… should I take my shirt off? Or just lie here?
DOCTOR: Just lie here, that’s perfectly fine. Okay, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Try to breathe normally. Take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, and another one… good. Your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear a slight… creaking sound on both sides when you take a deep breath. It’s subtle. And your heart rate and rhythm are normal. Now, I'm going to gently feel your chest. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful.
PATIENT: Okay. That feels… okay. A little pressure, but not really painful. Um… wait. There. On the left side. When you push there. It's not a sharp pain, just… a little bit sore. Like when you’ve been using your muscles too much. Like I said before. It's not bad, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Yes, I do feel some tenderness there. It doesn't seem to be anything acutely inflamed, but it's good that you pointed it out. Given your occupation and the tenderness you’re experiencing, it’s possible this is related to muscle strain or irritation of the cartilage between your ribs—what we call costochondritis. However, since you’re experiencing chest pain, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Um… is that expensive? I don't have insurance, Doctor. I don't want to get a big bill. I just thought it was a little muscle pain. I don’t know… is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Bulaong. I understand not wanting to incur unexpected costs, especially without insurance. An X-ray can help us rule out things like pneumonia, fluid around the lungs, or other structural issues. While muscle strain is a possibility, we need to be thorough. The cost of an X-ray varies, but I can ask our billing department to give you an estimate before we proceed, and we can discuss options if it's beyond your budget. We might also be able to explore payment plans. Alternatively, we could try a trial of anti-inflammatory medication and see if that improves your symptoms. However, if the pain doesn't improve or worsens, we would still need to consider an X-ray to get a clearer diagnosis. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… a trial of medicine sounds… okay. Less scary than an X-ray. And cheaper, probably. What kind of medicine? And how long would I have to take it? If it doesn't work, would I have to get the X-ray then? I don't want to be pressured into something I can’t afford.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. We’re not pressuring you into anything, and it’s important to make a decision you’re comfortable with. I'm thinking we can start with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, like ibuprofen. It helps reduce inflammation and pain. We can start with 600 milligrams three times a day with food for a week. If your symptoms don’t improve significantly after a week, or if they worsen at any point, then I would strongly recommend the X-ray to rule out other causes. But we can reassess at that point and discuss your options again. Does that sound like a plan you’d be comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Ibuprofen sounds okay. I think I’ve taken that before for headaches. A week… I can try that. And then we’ll see. If it doesn’t work, we can talk about the X-ray again. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad we could come up with a plan you’re comfortable with. I’ll write you a prescription for the ibuprofen. It’s important to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. And if you experience any side effects, like stomach pain, nausea, or dizziness, stop taking it and contact me immediately. I also want to emphasize that if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, or radiating pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained everything really well. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll try the ibuprofen and see what happens. I appreciate you not pushing me for the X-ray right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. It was my pleasure. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
