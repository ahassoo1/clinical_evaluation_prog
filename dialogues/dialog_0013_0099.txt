DOCTOR: Hi Denis, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. I am here because of some tests I recently had done – a GI endoscopy, I believe it was called. The results… weren’t quite what I expected, and my regular physician suggested I come in for further discussion.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A GI endoscopy… and your doctor wanted you to follow up on the results with me. That's good proactive care on their part. Do you happen to have a copy of those results with you, or was it sent directly to us?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have a copy with me. My physician's office assured me the results were sent directly to you, electronically, I presume. I am not terribly familiar with these modern conveniences, if you understand. I simply followed their instructions. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Denis. Electronic transfer is very common these days, so it should be in my system. Ah, here we are. Okay, I’m reviewing the endoscopy report now. It does show some… findings. It indicates some inflammation and a couple of small polyps were identified in the descending colon. Now, to help me understand things a little better from your perspective, could you tell me about what symptoms led your regular physician to order the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, for the past several months, I have been experiencing… discomfort. A sort of cramping in my abdomen, primarily on the lower left side. And… changes in my bowel habits, if you will. Sometimes constipation, sometimes… the opposite. It’s been rather unpredictable, and frankly, quite bothersome. It wasn’t severe, mind you, but persistent enough to warrant a visit to my doctor. He initially thought it might be diverticulitis, but the tests revealed… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping primarily on the lower left side, and fluctuating bowel habits – both constipation and diarrhea. And it's been going on for several months. Has there been any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I have not observed any blood. That was one of my primary concerns, of course, but I have been… vigilant in that regard. It’s been more the discomfort and the irregularity that have been troubling me. I did notice a change in color occasionally, a darker shade than usual, but no blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No blood is definitely a positive. Darker stool color could be related to diet or absorption issues, we'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do not believe so. I have generally been quite healthy throughout my life, if I may say so myself. I had a bout with arthritis in my knees some years ago, but that is managed with occasional medication. Otherwise, I have not been diagnosed with any serious conditions. I do take a daily vitamin supplement, and I try to maintain a balanced diet, though admittedly, that can be challenging at times. My husband… my late husband, always took care of the cooking.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear you’ve been generally healthy. And I understand about your husband; it’s hard adjusting to those changes. So, just to confirm, the arthritis is currently managed, and you're taking a daily vitamin. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never had any surgeries. I have always been rather fortunate in that regard. A few minor ailments over the years, nothing requiring intervention of that sort. Just the arthritis, and that has been relatively well-controlled with medication and physical therapy. I have always believed in preventative care, if that makes any sense. A healthy lifestyle, regular check-ups… that sort of thing. Though, clearly, something has arisen now.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about prioritizing preventative care; it often makes a difference. Okay, so no surgeries, just managed arthritis. Now, let’s briefly touch on family history. Are there any instances of colon cancer or other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. Hmm… My mother’s side… my grandfather, her father, passed away at a relatively young age, from what I understand, a stomach ailment. But it was many years ago, and the details were never discussed openly. My father’s side… no, I do not recall any instances of colon cancer specifically. There was an aunt who had gallstones, and a cousin with ulcers, but nothing related to the colon itself, to my knowledge. It wasn’t something we spoke about much, if I’m honest. Family gatherings were more focused on… celebrations, not illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a grandfather with a stomach ailment, and some gallstones and ulcers on the other side, but no direct history of colon cancer. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I have never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that is the extent of it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I have always believed in moderation and a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned earlier. My late husband and I… we enjoyed a quiet life. Simple pleasures, good food, good company… that was our preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent. No smoking, very limited alcohol, no drug use. Alright, Denis. Before we discuss the endoscopy results further and formulate a plan, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your abdomen, checking for any tenderness, and a basic check of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment implicitly. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, I'm not detecting any significant tenderness at this time, which is good. There's a little bit of… normal abdominal fullness, but nothing alarming. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Reflexes are good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Now, let's talk about those endoscopy results...
PATIENT: That is reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I must admit, I have been quite anxious about this. I appreciate your thoroughness. So, what did the endoscopy reveal, precisely? You mentioned inflammation and… polyps, I believe? Are they cause for concern? Please, be frank with me. I prefer to know the truth, however difficult it may be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis, I understand your anxiety, and you’re right to want a straightforward explanation. The endoscopy did show some inflammation in the descending colon, which can be caused by a variety of things – diet, infection, or even stress. However, the more significant finding was the presence of two small polyps. Now, polyps are growths in the lining of the colon. They’re quite common, and the vast majority are not cancerous. However, some polyps can develop into cancer over time, which is why they need to be addressed. The report indicates these polyps were small – less than 1 centimeter each – and they were removed during the endoscopy for a biopsy. The biopsy results will tell us exactly what type of polyps they are and whether there’s any cause for concern. We’re waiting for those results now. Do you have any immediate questions about that?
PATIENT: That… is a relief to hear that they were removed, at least. And that the vast majority are not cancerous is… comforting. So, these biopsy results will determine the next course of action? What if… what if they are cancerous? What would that entail? I understand this is a lot of information, and I apologize if I am being… difficult. It is simply… a great deal to process. I confess, my mind is racing.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Denis. It is a lot to process, and it’s perfectly normal to be anxious and have questions. Yes, the biopsy results will determine the next course of action. If the polyps are benign – meaning non-cancerous – we would likely recommend a follow-up colonoscopy in a few years to monitor for any new growths. The frequency would depend on the specific type of polyp and your overall risk factors. If the biopsy does show any signs of cancer, the treatment options would depend on the stage and extent of the cancer. In many cases, early-stage colon cancer can be treated very effectively with a surgical removal of the affected portion of the colon, followed by possible chemotherapy or radiation therapy. It’s important to remember that we don’t have those results yet, and it’s entirely possible they will be benign. We'll discuss all the options thoroughly if that is the case. For now, let’s focus on getting those results and taking things one step at a time. Do you have any family history of colon cancer that you're aware of, even remotely?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, Doctor, there was my grandfather on my mother’s side who passed away from a stomach ailment. It was a long time ago, and the details were never discussed openly. I do not believe it was specifically diagnosed as colon cancer, but it was… something related to the digestive system. My aunt on my father’s side had gallstones, and a cousin had ulcers, but nothing more serious. That is all I am aware of, truthfully. We were not a family who spoke openly about illnesses. Is that information helpful? Perhaps it is irrelevant. I feel rather helpless, simply waiting for these results.
DOCTOR: That information is helpful, Denis, thank you. The grandfather’s stomach ailment is worth noting, even if we don’t have a specific diagnosis. It's always good to have as much family history as possible, even if it’s vague. You’re not helpless at all. Waiting is the hardest part, I understand that. While we’re waiting for the biopsy results, there are some things you can do. First, we can focus on optimizing your diet. A high-fiber diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can promote healthy digestion and reduce your risk of future polyps. We can also discuss incorporating more probiotics into your diet, which can help support a healthy gut microbiome. Second, it’s important to stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water can help keep your bowel movements regular and prevent constipation. Third, if you're experiencing any anxiety or stress, don't hesitate to reach out for support. We can discuss some coping mechanisms or even refer you to a therapist if you feel you would benefit from it. Do any of those things sound helpful to you right now?
PATIENT: Those all sound… sensible, Doctor. Especially the diet. I confess, I have not been eating as well lately. My late husband was the cook, as I mentioned, and I have struggled to maintain a healthy routine since his passing. Perhaps focusing on my diet would be a good starting point. And staying hydrated… that is simple enough. The anxiety… yes, that is certainly present. I have been rather restless at night, unable to sleep properly. I suppose a therapist might be helpful, though I confess, I am not particularly fond of the idea. But I am willing to consider it if it would alleviate some of this… unease. Would you recommend I start with the dietary changes and increased hydration, and then revisit the idea of therapy if those are not sufficient?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable approach, Denis. Start with the dietary changes and increased hydration, and then we can revisit the idea of therapy if needed. I have a pamphlet here with some tips on incorporating more fiber into your diet, and a list of foods that are rich in probiotics. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or so, once we have the biopsy results, to discuss them and formulate a more detailed plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as abdominal pain, bleeding, or changes in your bowel habits – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. You have alleviated much of my anxiety, simply by explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your kindness and willingness to listen. A follow-up appointment in a week sounds perfect. I will focus on improving my diet and staying hydrated in the meantime. And thank you again for the pamphlet. It is very helpful. I believe I am ready to leave now, if that is agreeable to you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Denis. You’re very welcome. It was my pleasure to meet you and I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. I'll have the receptionist schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care of yourself, and remember to focus on those healthy habits. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
