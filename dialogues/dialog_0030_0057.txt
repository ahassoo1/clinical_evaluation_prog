DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It is very nice to meet you as well. I… well, I was told to come see you because of the cancer. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That can be very overwhelming. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t know much right now; that’s what I’m here for. To clarify, were you recently given a cancer diagnosis by another doctor?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. A doctor at the hospital… he told me. It was a few weeks ago, I think. I was still… very upset then, so it’s a little blurry. He said something about needing to see someone for… help with things. He gave me your name.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And do you recall what kind of cancer he mentioned?
PATIENT: Um… he said… something about the blood? Like, it wasn’t in the blood, exactly, but something with the blood. It’s a very confusing name. I tried to write it down, but my hand was shaking. I don’t think I did a very good job.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s very common to have trouble remembering details when receiving difficult news. Let me see if I can pull up your records from the hospital to get a clearer picture. Do you happen to remember the name of the hospital, or perhaps the doctor who gave you the news?
PATIENT: Yes, it was… Saint Joseph’s Hospital. And the doctor… his name was Dr. Abernathy. I think that’s right. It was a very long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I see your visit with Dr. Abernathy on July 15th. It appears you were diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia – ALL, for short. It’s a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Is that what Dr. Abernathy was referring to when he mentioned something about the blood?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds right. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. It’s a mouthful. He said it was… fast-growing. And that I needed treatment right away. What does “treatment” mean, exactly? Is that… chemotherapy? I’ve heard that word.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a mouthful. And yes, you are correct; ALL is a fast-growing type of cancer. As for treatment, chemotherapy is often the primary approach for ALL. It uses medications to kill the cancer cells. However, there are other potential treatments as well, such as targeted therapy or, in some cases, a bone marrow transplant. Before we discuss specific options, I'd like to get a more complete picture of your overall health. Would you mind if I ask you some questions about your medical history, any medications you're currently taking, and any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright. I understand. Yes, you can ask me anything. I don’t take any medications, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of. My husband… he passed away last year, so I haven’t really been to the doctor much since then. I was very healthy before that, I think.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone close is incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that your health may have taken a backseat during that time. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll do my best to answer any questions you have along the way. Since you mentioned being generally healthy before last year, have you had any significant medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I think. Chickenpox, measles… things like that. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that’s about it. I’ve always been pretty strong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a harder question. My mother… she passed away when I was young. I don’t really remember her very well. And my father… he wasn’t around much. I don’t know anything about his family. I’m afraid I can’t really tell you much about family history.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common for people to have limited information about their family history. We can proceed without it for now. Now, to get a better understanding of how the leukemia is affecting you, I'd like to ask about any symptoms you've been experiencing. Have you noticed any unusual fatigue, bruising easily, frequent infections, or bone pain?
PATIENT: Yes… the fatigue is… very bad. I’m tired all the time. Even getting out of bed is hard some days. And I have been bruising easily. I bumped my arm on the table a few days ago, and it turned purple right away. I just thought I was clumsy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Fatigue and easy bruising are common symptoms of ALL. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, or swollen lymph nodes?
PATIENT: I… I have been having a lot of nightsweats. Waking up soaked. And I think I’ve lost some weight, but I haven’t really been trying to. I just haven’t had much of an appetite lately. And… sometimes my bones ache, especially in my legs.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me. Those symptoms are also consistent with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to further assess your condition. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and look for any signs of bruising or other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Please, go ahead. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, but I note a slightly elevated heart rate. I detect some mild enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. The abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper left quadrant. Finally, I examine her skin, noting the bruising on her arm. Okay, Chellsea. I’ve completed the physical exam. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and I detected some mild swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck. Your abdomen is tender to the touch. The bruising is also consistent with what we’ve discussed. To confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment, we’ll need to perform some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a bone marrow biopsy. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A bone marrow biopsy? What does that involve? Is it… painful? I’m not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, and it's understandable to be concerned. A bone marrow biopsy involves taking a small sample of bone marrow from your hip bone. It's done under local anesthesia, so you'll feel a brief pinch or pressure, but it shouldn't be intensely painful. We’ll do everything we can to minimize any discomfort. We’ll numb the area thoroughly before taking the sample. The procedure usually takes about 20-30 minutes, and you’ll be monitored closely afterwards. It’s the most definitive way to confirm the diagnosis of ALL and determine the specific type of leukemia you have. The blood tests will give us information about your blood cell counts and overall health. Would you like me to explain the purpose of each test in more detail, or would you prefer to schedule the tests and discuss the results afterwards?
PATIENT: Please, explain them a little more. I like to know what’s happening, even if it’s… scary. Especially the bone marrow biopsy. What will they do with the sample?
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. Let’s start with the blood tests. A complete blood count, or CBC, will tell us how many red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets you have. In ALL, we often see an abnormal number of these cells. It helps us get a general picture of how the leukemia is affecting your blood. Now, the bone marrow biopsy is a bit more involved. It’s the gold standard for diagnosing ALL. We take a small sample of the bone marrow – the spongy tissue inside your bones where blood cells are made. A pathologist – a doctor who specializes in examining tissues – will look at the sample under a microscope to see if there are leukemia cells present. They’ll also analyze the cells to determine the specific type of ALL you have, which helps us choose the most effective treatment plan. The biopsy itself involves inserting a thin needle into your hip bone. You’ll be lying on your side, and we’ll numb the area with local anesthesia. You might feel some pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be severely painful. After the sample is taken, we’ll apply pressure to the site to stop any bleeding. Do you have any other questions about the procedure, or anything else I can clarify?
PATIENT: So… they’re looking for the bad cells in my bone marrow? And the blood tests tell them how many bad cells are floating around? How long will it take to get the results? And… what happens if they do find the bad cells? What’s the next step?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ve got it. They’re looking for the leukemia cells in your bone marrow and the blood tests tell us how many of those abnormal cells are circulating in your blood. As for the timing, the blood test results usually come back within a day or two. The bone marrow biopsy takes a bit longer, typically 3-5 business days, as it requires detailed analysis by the pathologist. If the tests confirm the diagnosis of ALL, the next step is to develop a treatment plan. This usually involves chemotherapy, as we discussed earlier. We’ll also need to consider other factors, such as your age, overall health, and the specific type of ALL you have. We'll discuss all of the potential side effects and benefits of treatment, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s right for you. It’s a lot to take in, I know. I want to assure you that you won't be going through this alone. We have a team of specialists – oncologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals – who will support you every step of the way. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions that I can address right now?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. It’s just… a lot. And chemotherapy… I’ve heard stories. It makes people very sick, doesn’t it? Is there anything else I can do? Besides the tests and… chemotherapy? Is there some kind of medicine to make it easier?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot. And it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and scared. You’ve heard stories about chemotherapy, and unfortunately, some of them are true – it can have side effects. However, it’s important to remember that chemotherapy has improved significantly over the years. We now have medications to help manage many of the side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. We also focus on supportive care – providing you with the resources and support you need to cope with the physical and emotional challenges of treatment. This includes medications to prevent infections, manage pain, and help you maintain your quality of life. As for other treatment options, depending on the specific type of ALL you have, there may be other therapies available, such as targeted therapy or immunotherapy. These therapies work differently than chemotherapy and may have different side effects. A bone marrow transplant is also an option for some patients. We'll discuss all of these options in detail once we have the results of your tests. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests scheduled. Would you like me to help you with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I don’t think I could do it on my own right now. And… could we schedule them for as soon as possible? I just want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Let’s get these tests scheduled as quickly as possible. Alright, I’m scheduling you for a complete blood count tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at the lab just down the street. And I’ll arrange for the bone marrow biopsy next week, hopefully by Wednesday. We’ll get the exact time confirmed by tomorrow. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Wednesday is fine. Thank you, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve been very helpful. Is there anything else I need to do before the tests? Should I fast or… stop taking any medications?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help. As for preparation, for the blood test tomorrow, you don’t need to fast, but please drink plenty of water. For the bone marrow biopsy next week, you don't need to do anything special at this time. I’ll give you more detailed instructions when we confirm the appointment time. Do you have any questions about the paperwork, or do you need help with transportation or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m alright. The paperwork is fine. And I have a ride for both appointments. Thank you so much for everything, Doctor Quicksey. I… I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Chellsea. That’s exactly what I was hoping for. Remember, I’m here for you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns between now and your appointments, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We'll see you tomorrow morning for the blood test, and we’ll get you scheduled for the bone marrow biopsy soon after. Take care, and try to rest. .
