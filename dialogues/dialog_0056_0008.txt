DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocked, you know? It’s been… a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “full” is a good way to describe it. And you said it’s been going on for a while… when did you first notice it, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… hmm. Before… before Martha… passed. Yes, definitely before then. Maybe… six months? Or was it eight? It's hard to say, everything feels like one long blur. It wasn't sudden, just… gradually got worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several months. And it wasn’t a sudden thing, more of a gradual worsening. Do you have any pain with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Just… annoying. Like when you're on a plane, you know? That pressure. It’s not sharp pain, just… discomfort. It makes it hard to hear sometimes too, but not all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just pressure and some hearing difficulty. Is it one ear or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, definitely the left. The right one seems fine. I haven't really… paid much attention, to be honest. Busy, you know? It’s just… the left one is the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left ear. Have you noticed any drainage, ringing in the ear, or dizziness with this?
PATIENT: Drainage? No. No, nothing coming out. Ringing… sometimes, maybe? A very faint ringing. It’s not constant, though. And no dizziness… no, I don't think so. I haven't fallen or anything. I get a bit unsteady sometimes, but I put that down to… well, getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no drainage, faint ringing occasionally, and no dizziness. Have you tried anything to relieve it so far?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Not really. I mean, I’ve tried… blowing my nose, I suppose. And maybe… chewing gum? Nothing's really made a difference, to be honest. I don't bother much with… doctoring, unless it's really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no real attempts to treat it. Okay. And do you have any allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Dust, maybe? I sneeze a bit. And medications… let me think. Just the usual, I suppose. For my blood pressure. And something for my… arthritis, in my hands. I can't remember the names, sorry. It's all a bit of a blur. My daughter usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust allergy, and medications for blood pressure and arthritis. We can look those up in your chart. Do you have any history of ear infections, or have you had any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing recently, though. And… I had a bit of a sniffle a few months back, but nothing major. Just a common cold, I think. It didn’t last long. Honestly, I get so many little… ailments, I can’t keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible ear infection as a child, and a recent cold. Alright. Let's take a quick look at your ear, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with, if you don't mind. I have… things to do. I’m not good at sitting around for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm looking now. There's some wax buildup in the ear canal, and the eardrum looks a bit… dull. It’s not dramatically abnormal, but it’s not completely clear either. It's difficult to see everything clearly with the wax present. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions now while I’m looking. Can you tell me if you can hear me clearly in both ears?
PATIENT: Yes, I can hear you alright in both. Though… the left one is a bit muffled, as usual. It’s not bad, just… not as sharp as the right one. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. Okay. And can you tell me if you've experienced any recent changes in your balance, or any feelings of spinning?
PATIENT: Spinning… no. No spinning. I get a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes, like I said, but not spinning. It's just… getting older. My daughter says I should be more careful. But I don’t really… notice it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no spinning. Alright. Given what you've told me, and what I've seen, it sounds like you likely have some cerumen impaction – or wax buildup – in your left ear, which could be contributing to the feeling of fullness and muffled hearing. It’s not an emergency, but it's something we can address. I recommend we try to remove the wax. Would you be comfortable with me attempting that today?
PATIENT: Remove the wax? Yes, yes, that sounds good. Get it out of there, if you can. The sooner the better. I don't like the feeling of it being blocked. As long as it doesn’t… hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s generally a very quick and painless procedure. I’ll use a few different tools to gently soften and remove the wax. There’s a small chance it could cause a bit of temporary discomfort, but I’ll let you know if I feel any resistance. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to use a few drops of mineral oil to soften the wax. It might feel a little cool at first. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Cool is alright. Just… get it done quickly, if you can. I have… appointments later. And it’s rather stuffy in here.
DOCTOR: Alright, just keep your head tilted to the left for about five minutes. This will allow the oil to soften the wax. While we’re waiting, I’m going to quickly review your medications and allergies in the chart, just to be sure we have everything correct.
PATIENT: Is it… done yet? It feels a bit… wet in there. And cold. I really must get going soon. Martha always said I get impatient…
DOCTOR: Okay, it’s been about five minutes. Let's see if the wax has softened enough. I’m going to use a small instrument to gently remove it now. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright, I'm starting now... just a little pressure... can you hear me okay?
PATIENT: A bit… ticklish. And cold. Yes, I can hear you. But it’s… strange. Like something’s… moving in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little more… almost got it… I'm seeing some of the wax now… good. Just a little bit more… Okay, I think I’ve got the bulk of it out. Let me take a look… Okay, the ear canal is looking much clearer now. The eardrum still looks a bit dull, but that’s likely just from the wax residue. Let’s see if your hearing has improved. Can you tell me if sounds seem clearer in your left ear now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, it is clearer. Not perfect, but… much better. I can hear you more easily. It doesn’t feel so… blocked anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! I'm glad we were able to improve your hearing. There may be a small amount of residue left, so I recommend using over-the-counter earwax removal drops once a week for a few weeks to help keep your ear canal clear. Avoid using cotton swabs, as they can push the wax further in. I’m going to give you a prescription for these drops, and I’ll also send a summary of today’s visit to your primary care doctor. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you. It's a relief to have it sorted. I really must get going now. Martha would have wanted me to finish my errands… .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. I'm glad I could help. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms or new concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and take care.
