DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this breathing. It’s been… troublesome. When I lie down flat, it gets harder to breathe. It’s not good. I don’t like it one bit. I’d like to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Troublesome breathing, particularly when lying flat. Alright. Can you describe what it feels like when it gets harder?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… a tightness, I suppose. Like something is pressing on my chest. Not a pain, exactly, but uncomfortable. And I have to… concentrate to take a good breath. It’s better when I sit up, or when I use extra pillows. It’s been going on for… oh, a few months now, I’d say. Maybe longer? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A tightness, not pain, improves with sitting up or pillows... and it's been going on for a few months, intermittent. Right. And has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Triggered it? Oh dear. Let me think… Not that I recall. My routine hasn’t altered much. I go to the library, I tend to my garden, I watch my stories on television. I did have a slight cold back in… March, perhaps? But that cleared up quickly. Nothing else comes to mind. I suppose getting older isn't helping any.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No recent changes, a cold a few months ago... And you feel age may be a factor. Alright. Now, do you experience any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not really. A little bit sometimes, in the mornings. Just a tickle in my throat, nothing major. Doesn’t bother me much. It's not a deep, hacking cough, if that’s what you mean. More like… clearing my throat. And it doesn't happen with the breathing trouble, not usually.
DOCTOR: A slight morning cough, separate from the breathing difficulties. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see... Oh, a little. Sometimes, at the end of the day. But I always thought that was just from being on my feet too long at the library. It goes down overnight, usually. Nothing dramatic. I don't think so, not really. Is that something to be worried about?
DOCTOR: It can be relevant. Alright. And have you noticed any shortness of breath when you're not lying down?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… when I’m not lying down? Well, I do get a little winded sometimes when I’m weeding the garden. But I’m 71, Doctor! A bit of exertion is to be expected, isn’t it? Nothing I haven't dealt with before. It’s not a sudden thing, if that makes sense. I can still manage my routine, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known health conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on a pill for that, years ago. Still take it every day. Other than that… I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bothersome. No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. I've had the usual aches and pains of getting older, but nothing serious. I go for my check-ups, you know. I try to stay on top of things. .
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
