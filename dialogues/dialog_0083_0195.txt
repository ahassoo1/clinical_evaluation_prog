DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s… alright. Honestly, it’s a bit silly, but my daughter said I should come. She thinks I need a little… cheering up. I just wanted to ask if you could maybe write me a nice card? A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. It’s just… things have been a bit down, you know? Not physically ill, just… down.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Micucci. It's very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in, and it's perfectly alright to seek support for emotional well-being. While I'm a physician and typically address physical health concerns, I absolutely can document your feelings and discuss resources that might be helpful. I'm happy to write a note as well. However, to best understand how to support you, could you tell me a little more about what's been making you feel down?
PATIENT: Oh, resources… honestly, I don’t need any of that. I just want a nice card. But fine, if you must know… it's just… everything. My husband, he doesn't listen. The kids are always busy. And the neighborhood… well, it's not what it used to be. People don't respect things anymore. It's all just… noise. And complaints. I don’t want a lecture on ‘coping mechanisms’ or anything like that. I just want a bit of… kindness. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Micucci, that is not hard to understand at all. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and feeling unsupported, and that's completely valid. I apologize if I made it sound like I was dismissing your feelings. A note expressing encouragement is certainly something I can do. Before I do that, though, and just to be thorough, would you mind if I ask a few brief questions about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, thorough. Everyone’s always so thorough. Look, I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I eat my dal bhat, I walk every day, I don't go around complaining about every little ache and pain like some people I know. What good will a list of questions do? Honestly, just write the card, please. A nice, cheerful card. With maybe a flower on it? Don’t put anything about ‘seeking help’ on it, though. My daughter will just… fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. I respect your wishes. I will absolutely write a cheerful card with a flower on it, and I won't include anything about seeking help. However, as your physician, even a brief check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse – would be standard practice. It takes just a moment, and it can sometimes reveal underlying issues that aren't immediately apparent. It wouldn't involve any blood tests or anything like that, just a quick assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, assessment. Honestly. You doctors and your… assessments. Fine. But don’t make a fuss if it’s normal. I told you I’m healthy. Just get it over with, quickly. And don’t poke and prod too much. I have better things to do, you know. And make sure the card is a nice colour. Not one of those… drab, depressing colours.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat here, and I'll get started. First, let’s just take your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss for a simple card. You young people… always needing to do everything the complicated way. Just get it over with. And be careful, I bruise easily. My mother always said I had delicate veins.
DOCTOR: I will be very careful, Ms. Micucci. Your mother was right to be protective. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88, and your pulse is 78. That's slightly elevated, actually. Not dramatically, but a little higher than ideal. Do you experience stress or anxiety frequently?
PATIENT: Stress? Anxiety? Of course I do! I just told you about my husband, my kids, the neighborhood! What kind of question is that? Honestly, you’re supposed to be writing a card, not giving me a quiz. Slightly elevated? Everything’s “slightly elevated” these days. It’s the world, you know. It’s a stressful world. Now, are you going to write the card or are we going to continue this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Micucci. It is a stressful world, and your feelings are completely valid. I apologize for pressing the questioning. It's just my nature as a doctor to explore potential causes for even slightly elevated readings. However, you are right, we should focus on what you want. I will write the card immediately. Would you prefer any particular message, or shall I write something encouraging and general?
PATIENT: Just… something nice. About how things will get better. And maybe about being strong. Not too… cheesy, though. And definitely no mention of doctors or… therapy. Just… nice. Like a friend would write. Is that so hard? Honestly, you people… always making things so complicated.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Micucci. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… alright. Not too bad. It’s not cheesy. And there’s a flower. That's good. It will do. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have errands to run. I hope this is all the paperwork I need to fill out. I really don’t have the patience for a lot of forms.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. There's no additional paperwork required. Just a quick note documenting our conversation. I am glad the card is to your liking. If you ever feel overwhelmed, please remember it’s okay to reach out. I wish you all the best with your errands, and a brighter day. Feel free to schedule another appointment if you ever need to.
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.
