DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just been gettin' these fevers, comin' and goin'. It's been happenin' a while now, and it's startin' to bother me. Not sure what’s causin’ it, that's why I figured I'd come in.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Fevers, you say. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? Around the first week of May, I think. It’s not every day, you know? Comes and goes like the weather. It’ll be gone for a week or two, then bam, back again. A hundred and one, maybe a hundred and two when it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Three months, intermittent fevers reaching 101-102°F. And besides the fever itself, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I get kinda tired, feel weak. Sometimes a little achy, like I've been workin’ too hard in the garden. No cough, no sniffles, nothin' like a cold. Just… generally feel run down when the fever hits. And thirsty. Real thirsty.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, weakness, myalgia, and increased thirst concurrent with the fevers. Have you noticed any night sweats, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Night sweats… now that you mention it, yeah. Been changin' the sheets a couple times a month. Didn’t think much of it, figured it was just the summer heat. And weight loss… maybe a couple pounds? My wife keeps tellin' me I'm eatin' less, but I ain’t been keepin' track.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent fevers, fatigue, myalgia, increased thirst, night sweats, and possible unintentional weight loss. Now, let’s go through some more general questions. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I'm a chiropractor, keep people healthy, you know? Been lucky so far. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin' old. My wife keeps tellin' me to slow down, but… a man’s gotta work.
DOCTOR: Right. A chiropractor. And no chronic medical conditions. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed any. Just a few sprained ankles playin’ baseball when I was a kid. Nothin' serious. You know, I always thought a good adjustment would fix most things. This fever… it’s different.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No prior surgeries. And you’ve said no chronic medical conditions. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doc. And sometimes ibuprofen for my back when it’s really botherin’ me. That’s it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. Not that I know of, anyway. My wife always says I’m too stubborn to even get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. No allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure when she got older. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, too. Nothing major on my wife’s side, as far as I know. Mostly healthy people, both sides. Though, her Aunt Rosa had… something with her joints, maybe arthritis? It was years ago, I don’t remember the details.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension and heart disease in your parents, possible arthritis in your wife’s family. And finally, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc, I don’t. Never liked smokin’. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe one or two. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty straight-laced fella. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no recreational drugs. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and feel your lymph nodes. Do you have any pain anywhere specific that I should be aware of before I begin?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' specific. My back's always a little achy, but that's just part of the job. Just be gentle with the belly, Doc. Gets a little tender sometimes.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, no guarding or rebound tenderness. Cervical lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, non-tender, mobile. Axillary and inguinal nodes are normal. Your lymph nodes are a little bit swollen, and your abdomen is tender, but overall, the exam isn't revealing anything definitive. Given your intermittent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and now these findings, I'm concerned about a possible underlying infection or inflammatory process. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will include a complete blood count, metabolic panel, inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP, and a basic infectious workup. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Yeah, go ahead and do whatever you think is best, Doc. I just want to feel normal again. Blood work’s fine. Just let me know if it’s gonna take long, I got appointments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is right down the hall, it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend getting some rest and drinking plenty of fluids. I'll also have the nurse take your temperature and blood pressure before you leave. I'll put in the orders for the blood work now. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nah, I think you got it covered, Doc. Thirty minutes, huh? Okay. Just… hope it's not somethin’ serious. Thanks for lookin' into it. Let me know when those results are back, alright? And yeah, I guess the nurse can check my temperature and blood pressure, sure. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. The nurse will be with you shortly. We’ll get those results back to you as quickly as possible. We'll call you with the results as soon as they are available. .
