DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar. Calin, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Calin Sachar. It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Burlingham.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let's get down to business, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. I understand this is about checking if I qualify for some help at home? It’s a little confusing, to be honest, all the different options. I’m hoping you can explain things clearly for me.
DOCTOR: Options. People always wanting something for nothing, isn't it?
PATIENT: Oh, no, that's not what I meant at all! I just… well, things have been a little difficult lately, and I was told this might be a possibility to make things a bit easier. I'm not looking for anything for nothing, just… support, if I need it. I work hard, you know. Pressing clothes is tiring work.
DOCTOR: Pressing clothes?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. I do alterations and pressing for people. Mostly around the neighbourhood. I used to work in a shop, but… things changed. It’s honest work, though. Keeps me busy, at least. It’s just… getting harder as time goes on.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, this isn’t some… grand medical crisis then. Just a bit of fatigue from manual labor. Tell me, how long have you been feeling… this way?
PATIENT: Not a crisis, no, definitely not. Just… worn down, I suppose. And it's been building, really. Probably… six months now? It started gradually, just a little more tired at the end of the day. Now… now it's hard to even get started some mornings. It's not just the physical part either, if that makes sense. Sometimes I just feel… low.
DOCTOR: "Low". Hmm. And this "low" feeling... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. Some days are better than others. But it’s been happening more often lately, and it seems to last longer when it does come. It’s hard to explain… like a weight, you know? Just… dragging me down. And it makes everything harder, even the pressing. It’s silly, I know. Just pressing clothes.
DOCTOR: Silly?
PATIENT: No, not silly silly! Just… it doesn’t seem like something worth bothering a doctor about, compared to, you know, real illnesses. But my daughter, she insisted I come. Said I shouldn’t be pushing myself so hard. She’s a good girl, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your daughter seems sensible. Tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing. Anything at all. Sleep, appetite, concentration… anything different from how you normally are.
PATIENT: Well… my sleep hasn't been the best. I toss and turn a lot. Not waking up completely, but not really resting either. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don't feel hungry at all. And concentration… oh, that’s definitely worse. I used to be able to remember patterns for alterations easily, but now I have to write everything down, and even then I forget things. It's frustrating, honestly. I feel like I'm losing my edge.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Not terrible, usually. More like a dull ache, across my forehead. They come and go, like everything else. I just… take some paracetamol and it usually goes away. It’s not something I’ve paid much attention to, to be honest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Ms. Sachar. Now. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, either up or down?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Actually… I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think. Not a lot, but… my clothes are a little looser than they used to be. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but I’d say maybe… five or ten pounds? It's probably just from not eating as much, now that I think about it. It's just another thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at you. Just a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse… the usual. Then we’ll see what we're dealing with. Don't expect miracles, mind you.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time, Dr. Burlingham. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Just lie down on the table. Let’s get this over with. And try to relax. Although, that might be asking too much.
PATIENT: I'll try my best. It’s just… hard to relax when I'm not sure what’s going on. But I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, Ms. Sachar. In and out. Good. Heart sounds are regular, although a little fast. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 88. Temperature is normal. Lymph nodes are…slightly enlarged. Hmm. I'll need to order some blood work. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh. Slightly enlarged? That doesn't sound good, does it? What are you ruling out, exactly? Is it something serious? I’m… a little scared now. I just wanted to see if I qualified for some help at home, not… find out something was terribly wrong.
DOCTOR: Now, now, don't jump to conclusions, Ms. Sachar. Slightly enlarged lymph nodes could be anything. An infection, a minor inflammation… even stress can cause them to swell. But we need to rule out anything more serious, naturally. We'll do a complete blood count, check your thyroid levels, and a few other basic tests. It’s just standard procedure. I'll also order a Vitamin D level. People don't get enough sun these days. The lab work will take a few days. I’ll have the results sent to the clinic. Then we’ll go from there. Don’t worry yourself sick over it. It's likely nothing.
PATIENT: Okay. "Likely nothing"… I can hold onto that. What about the help at home? Is that still a possibility, while we're waiting for the results? I was hoping to… well, it would make things a lot easier, you know? Even just a few hours a week.
DOCTOR: Assistance at home requires some justification, Ms. Sachar. It's not a handout. We need to see what's causing this fatigue first. If it’s just… general weariness, there are other options. Social services, support groups… things like that. I’ll have my nurse give you some information about those. Once we have the blood work results, then we can discuss whether you qualify for any in-home assistance. Don't expect too much, mind you. Resources are limited. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Burlingham. I'll wait for the results, and the information from your nurse. I appreciate you taking the time, even if it's not… what I was hoping for. .
DOCTOR: Right. My nurse will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you develop any new or worsening symptoms. And try to get some rest. That's all.
