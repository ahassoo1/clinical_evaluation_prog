DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach. It's been… off. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and honestly, I can’t really remember when it started exactly. It just… is. It's pretty annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, "off" and a lot of diarrhea. And you said it’s been going on for a bit… hmm. It's okay if you can’t pinpoint exactly when, we’ll figure it out. Just… a bit now, is that several days, a week, longer?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, I really don’t know. Probably… more than a week? Maybe two? It feels like it’s been forever, but I honestly lose track of days sometimes. I just know it’s not new. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been… more come than go, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. “More come than go,” I can appreciate that description. So, more frequent diarrhea recently. Any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes I feel really tired, just… drained. And my stomach cramps a bit, especially before it… you know. Not awful cramps, but uncomfortable. Oh, and I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot more often than usual, obviously. I don’t really feel sick otherwise, though. No fever, no vomiting… just… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, some stomach cramping before diarrhea, and frequent bathroom trips. No fever or vomiting, that's good. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or anything unusual with the color?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a bit… personal. I think… maybe once or twice I noticed a little bit of red, but I just assumed it was something I ate? It wasn’t a lot, honestly. Like, just a tiny bit. Everything else is… pretty normal color, I guess. I don’t really pay that much attention, if I’m being honest. It's embarrassing talking about this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jase. These things are a little embarrassing, and it's perfectly okay to feel that way. We’re here to help, and I need to ask these questions to get a good picture of what’s going on. So, a tiny bit of red once or twice. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I eat about the same, I think. Maybe a little less when my stomach is really bad, just because I don't feel like eating. But I haven't lost my appetite completely. My husband makes really good food, so it's hard to say no to that, even when I'm feeling icky. He worries a lot, though, when I'm not eating.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, you're still able to eat and your husband is caring for you. So, mostly eating normally. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… that's a good question. I think… a long time ago, a doctor said something about my intestines being sensitive? He told me to avoid certain foods, but honestly, I don't remember what foods. And I think… maybe celiac? My mom said something about that, but I was pretty young then. I don't know if that's right. I've just always had stomach problems, so I kind of got used to it. I have Medicare, if that helps. Does that tell you anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some past issues with intestinal sensitivity and a possible mention of celiac disease. Medicare is helpful, yes. Let me just see… ah, yes. It looks like you were evaluated for Irritable Bowel Syndrome several years ago, and there was some testing done for celiac. The celiac test was negative, and the impression was IBS. Do you recall any specific dietary recommendations at that time?
PATIENT: Oh, that's right! I remember going to a lot of appointments… and something about cutting out gluten? Maybe dairy, too? It was a long time ago, and like I said, I don't really remember all the details. I tried it for a while, but it was hard, you know? My family eats everything. And it didn’t seem to make a huge difference, so I slowly started eating normal again. I felt bad being different. It was a long time ago, though, and I probably didn't do it right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you trialed a gluten-free diet with some limitations, but didn't experience significant improvement, and it was difficult to maintain. And now you're experiencing diarrhea again. Do you take any medications regularly, or have you taken anything recently for your stomach issues?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I don't take any regular medications. I tried some over-the-counter stuff when my stomach is bad, like… Imodium? Something like that. It helps a little bit, but it doesn't last very long. I don't like taking pills, so I try to avoid it if I can. I just try to rest and drink a lot of water. And sometimes my husband makes me ginger tea. He swears it helps.
DOCTOR: Ginger tea is a good home remedy. Alright, no regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications. And now, just to finish up with the history, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes with spicy food, but that’s it. My husband is allergic to peanuts, but that’s him, not me. He’s very careful about it, so we don’t have peanuts in the house. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Really. I'm pretty sure. But, gosh, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. It's very common to have trouble remembering medical details. It sounds like you've been dealing with stomach issues for a while now. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. I'll listen to your stomach, and feel around to see if there's any tenderness. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. A quick exam sounds good. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I'm not a fan of doctors poking around, if I’m being honest. But I know you're trying to help. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. I will be as gentle as possible. I promise. Alright, let's start by listening to your stomach with the stethoscope. Just lie back on the exam table, please. Okay… sounds are… normal, but a little bit hyperactive. Not alarming, but consistent with diarrhea. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Um… a little bit. Right… there. It’s not really painful pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It feels better when I’m not pushing on it. And sometimes it feels like… gas, maybe? I get a lot of gas. I'm sorry, this is probably gross.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not gross at all, Jase. That's perfectly normal information. I feel some mild tenderness in your lower left abdomen, consistent with what you’re describing. No rebound tenderness or rigidity, which is good. Your abdomen is soft otherwise. Okay, that's all I need for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a flare-up of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or potentially something else going on. The vague discomfort and a history of IBS are suggestive of that, but given the redness you’ve occasionally noticed in your stool, and the persistent diarrhea, I'd like to order a stool test to rule out any infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool test? Oh, lovely. But, yeah, okay. If it'll help figure things out, then yes. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Renzi. I just want this to stop. My husband is starting to worry a lot, and I feel awful all the time. So, a stool test… okay. How do I… do it? Hopefully, it's not too complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jase. It’s not the most pleasant thing, but it's a simple test and will give us valuable information. I'll give you a collection kit and instructions. Basically, you collect a small sample of your stool in a clean container, and bring it to the lab. The instructions will explain everything in detail. It’s important to avoid taking any anti-diarrheal medications for a few days before the test, as that can affect the results. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be happy to help if you have any questions. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with the discomfort while we wait for the results. It's not a long-term solution, but it can provide some relief. I'd also recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating bland foods, like toast, rice, and bananas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, toast, rice, and bananas. I can do that. And no anti-diarrheal stuff. Got it. And a prescription… great. Thank you, Dr. Renzi. You've been really helpful. I feel a little better just knowing what we're trying to figure out. Hopefully, it's not anything too serious. I'll go do the… stool test… and then take the prescription to the pharmacy. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Yes, please do collect the stool sample as soon as possible. While we wait for the results, please watch out for any signs of dehydration, like dizziness, decreased urination, or extreme thirst. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Also, I'm going to write a note for your primary care physician, just to keep them informed of what we've discussed today. And, of course, if the symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that covers everything. You've explained everything really well. I'm just going to go collect the… sample… and then get the prescription. Thank you again, Dr. Renzi. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. It was nice meeting you.
