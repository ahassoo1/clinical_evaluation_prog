DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Odell. My name is Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I think. Something about travel? My wife… she, uh, booked this. Said I needed shots or something before we go. I don’t really remember where we’re going, just… hot. Very hot place.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like this appointment is for travel vaccinations. “Hot” gives us a starting point. Do you happen to know the country you’ll be visiting?
PATIENT: Country? Hmm… No. She always planned everything. I just… went with it. Lots of sand, I think. And people wore funny hats. Really colorful hats. I’m not good with names, never was. Is that okay? Will you… still give me the shots even if I don’t know where I’m going? It’s important we go, she wanted it so bad.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Odell, we can definitely work with this. Knowing the general region is helpful, even if you don’t know the exact country. Sand and colorful hats… that narrows things down a bit. Do you remember anything else about the trip?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is hard. She said… something about old things? Like, very old rocks and buildings. And… camels? There were definitely camels. A lot of them. We were going to see a lot of camels. She showed me pictures, but… it was a long time ago. I just want to get this over with, to be honest. Is it going to hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: Okay, old rocks, buildings, and camels… that sounds like potentially the Middle East or North Africa. We can look at recommendations for vaccinations based on those regions. As for the shots, it’s usually a quick pinch, and we can use a numbing cream if you’re concerned about pain. I want to make sure we give you the right vaccinations, though, so we don’t miss anything. Before we proceed, let’s quickly review your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No… not that I know of. She handled all the medicine. I just… took what she gave me. She was a nurse, see? Very good nurse. I never had to worry about anything. But… wait. Once, I think I got a rash. But it wasn’t from a pill, it was from… a plant? A flower, maybe? A red flower. But it was years ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, a rash from a plant years ago isn’t likely to be a problem for travel vaccinations, but it’s good you mentioned it. We’ll still ask some routine questions to be safe. Do you have any current medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Huh. No… nothing like that. I work, you know? Building airplane parts. It’s… hard work. Keeps me pretty busy. I’m… strong for my size. She always said I was strong. I don’t… sit around doing nothing. So, no, no fancy sicknesses or anything. Just… tired sometimes. Is that a sickness?
DOCTOR: Being tired isn’t usually a sickness on its own, Odell. It's good you're active. Now, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a baby? But she… she would have told me. She told me everything. I think… I broke my arm once, when I was a kid. But that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. A big, itchy cast. No, no surgeries. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And you're up to date on your routine vaccinations as far as you know?
PATIENT: Routine… vaccinations? Like, when I was little? I… I really don’t know. She took care of all that too! I just… got poked, and that was it. I never asked questions. She always said it was for my own good. I’m sorry, I’m not much help, am I? This is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: You’re not causing any trouble at all, Odell. It's perfectly fine that you don’t remember. We can make some educated guesses based on your age and general health. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No… nothing. Not pills, not anything. I don’t like taking medicine, makes me feel… funny. She… she was the only one. Maybe… sometimes I take something for my back. When it really hurts from work. But it’s just… a cream. You rub it on. I don’t swallow anything. She… I miss her so much. This is hard.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, Odell, and I'm very sorry for your loss. It's alright to take your time. So, just to clarify, you use a topical cream for your back pain, but you don’t take any pills or other medications regularly?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s right. Just the cream. When it really hurts. And… sometimes I drink tea. Ginger tea. For my stomach. Does that count? It’s just tea, though. Not… medicine tea. Just regular tea. With ginger. She… she made the best ginger tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications besides the topical cream, and ginger tea isn't something to worry about. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk about your weight and height. I see in your chart you're 155 centimeters and 104 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Ugh, numbers. She always measured me. Yes, I think so. I haven’t… really checked lately. I’m… small, I guess. But strong! She said I was strong for my size. Always said that. I… I used to be bigger, maybe? Before… before she got sick. But yeah, those numbers sound right. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. She… she hated smoking. Said it was terrible for your health. I wouldn’t… I wouldn't dare. No smoking, no. Definitely not. She would be very angry if I smoked. Very angry. I… I miss her so much. This is just… too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. Thank you for being so open with me, even though this is difficult. It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate and are still grieving. That's completely understandable. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Ugh… more poking? Fine. But be gentle, okay? And… quick? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Just… get it over with. I just want to know what shots I need so we can go. Where are we going again? I really can’t remember. Is it hot? It was hot, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s alright to be anxious. I’ll be as gentle as possible and as quick as I can. We'll figure out the necessary vaccinations, and hopefully, we can get you on your way soon. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Lung sounds are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well. 130/85. Again, could be anxiety-related. Now, I'm going to quickly examine your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No abnormalities detected. Alright, Odell, the physical exam is complete. Everything appears generally healthy, although your heart rate and blood pressure are a bit higher than ideal. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, given you don't know your destination but recall it being "hot" and involving old buildings and camels, I’m going to recommend a general travel vaccination package suitable for the Middle East or North Africa. This would include vaccinations for Hepatitis A and Typhoid, and a booster for Tetanus and Diphtheria. We should also discuss Malaria prevention, depending on the specific regions within those areas you might be visiting. Would you like me to explain each of these in more detail?
PATIENT: Ugh… so many names. Hepatitis A… Typhoid… sounds scary. Malaria… is that like a sickness? I just want… the fewest shots possible, okay? And… is it going to hurt a lot? And will it make me sick? I don’t want to be sick on our trip. She planned everything so carefully… I don’t want to ruin it. Just… tell me what I absolutely need, okay? And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You want the minimum necessary, and you're concerned about side effects. That’s perfectly reasonable. Given your description, and to err on the side of caution, I recommend the following as absolutely necessary: 1. Hepatism A Vaccine: This is highly recommended for travel to areas with poor sanitation, and it protects against a liver infection. It’s a two-dose series, given six months apart, but we can give you the first dose today. Side effects are usually mild – some soreness at the injection site, maybe a little fatigue. 2. Typhoid Vaccine: This protects against a bacterial infection spread through contaminated food and water. It's a single injection, and again, side effects are typically mild – soreness, low-grade fever. 3. Tetanus-Diphtheria Booster: It's good to be up-to-date on these anyway, and it’s a quick shot. As for Malaria, that’s a mosquito-borne disease. We’ll discuss preventative medication if you can narrow down the specific countries you might be visiting. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Ugh… two shots today? That sounds terrible. Is there… is there any way to just get one? Or… skip one? I really hate needles. And what if I get sick from the shots? That would be awful. She always said I had a weak immune system… I just want to go on the trip and remember her. This is… too much. Maybe we shouldn't go at all.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand your anxiety. It’s perfectly normal to be apprehensive about needles and side effects, especially given your concerns about your immune system. Let’s address your concerns one by one. While I recommend both Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccines for your safety, we can prioritize the Hepatitis A vaccine today. It offers broader protection and is generally considered the most important for travel to areas with unknown sanitation. We can discuss getting the Typhoid vaccine later, closer to your trip if you're able to determine your destination. As for side effects, they are usually very mild and short-lived. Soreness at the injection site is the most common, and some people experience mild fatigue or a low-grade fever. Severe reactions are extremely rare. Regarding your immune system, you mentioned your wife thought it was weak. It's important to note that a vaccine is designed to strengthen your immune system, not weaken it. However, if you have any underlying health conditions we are unaware of, that's something to consider. Would you feel more comfortable if we started with just the Hepatitis A vaccine today, and then reassess later?
PATIENT: Ugh… just one? Okay. Okay, that sounds… better. But… quick, okay? And… gentle? And… if I feel really bad after, can I come back? I don’t want to be sick on the trip. She… she would be so disappointed if I ruined everything. Just… get it over with. Quick and gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Odell. Quick and gentle, I promise. And yes, if you experience any concerning side effects after the vaccination, please come back immediately, and we’ll take care of you. That’s what we’re here for. Okay, I’m going to clean the injection site now. This might feel a little cold. There you go. All done. You might feel a slight pinch for a moment. Okay, keep that bandage on for a few hours. I recommend taking over-the-counter pain reliever like Tylenol if you experience any soreness. Here's a sheet with detailed instructions on potential side effects and how to manage them. I've also scheduled a follow-up appointment in four weeks for the second dose, but we can adjust that if you determine your travel destination sooner. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh… it’s done? Already? It didn’t feel… too bad, I guess. Just… a pinch. Is that it? Okay. No… I don’t think so. Just… where do I go from here? Do I need to… do anything special? And… will I remember everything now? I keep forgetting things. This is… frustrating. Maybe I should just stay home. It’s too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s done, Odell. You handled that very well. It sounds like you had a mild reaction, which is perfectly normal. As for what to do next, just monitor yourself for any side effects, like soreness, fatigue, or mild fever. Over-the-counter pain reliever can help with soreness. And drink plenty of fluids. Regarding your memory, it’s understandable to feel frustrated. Stress and anxiety can definitely affect memory. If you're concerned, I can refer you to a specialist for a cognitive evaluation, but it’s likely just related to stress. We've scheduled a follow-up appointment in four weeks, but please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. We’re here to help. And if you determine your travel destination, please let us know, and we can discuss additional precautions, like Malaria prevention. Take care, Odell. And don't worry, we'll get through this together.
