DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, Dr. Nestingen. It's about this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems silly, really. I feel fine. Always have. But you gotta do what they say, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a pre-employment physical is standard procedure. Even if you feel fine, it's important to have a baseline assessment. And, frankly, "always have" isn't a medical history. Now, can you tell me specifically what aspects of the exam they’re requesting?
PATIENT: A baseline? What's wrong with just knowing how I feel? They just gave me a list, honestly. It's... eyes, ears, blood pressure, weight… usual stuff, I guess. And something about a… chest thing? With the listenin' tube. Never had trouble breathin' or anythin'. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: "Usual stuff" can still reveal underlying issues, Mr. Hartness. We're not simply confirming what you already believe to be true; we’re looking for things you wouldn’t necessarily notice yourself. The "chest thing," as you put it, is an auscultation – listening to your heart and lungs. It’s quite standard. Let’s start with the basics. What is your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Height? I'm... tall. Real tall. Six foot two, I think. Maybe a bit more. Six foot three sometimes feels right. And weight... Oh, around fifty-three kilos, give or take. I’m a lean guy, always have been. Not much meat on my bones. Don't eat a lot of… heavy stuff.
DOCTOR: Fifty-three kilograms?
PATIENT: Yes. Fifty-three. What's wrong with that? Are you saying I look… thin? I told you, I’m lean! Not like those… other people. I keep myself in shape, alright? I do things. You know… manual labor. It keeps the weight off.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with your stated height of six foot two – or even six foot three – fifty-three kilograms is… significantly underweight. That's approximately 117 pounds for someone of your stature. We need to clarify this. Are you certain of your weight?
PATIENT: Look, I know my own weight! I’ve been weighin’ myself for years. Maybe your scale’s off. It’s always the scales, isn’t it? People expect everyone to fit into their little boxes. Honestly, I don't understand why we're even discussing this. I came here for the military exam, not a… weight lecture. What's next? Are you gonna tell me I need to eat more?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but this is medically relevant. Being severely underweight can indicate underlying health issues – malnutrition, eating disorders, or other conditions. I’m not attempting to lecture you; I’m attempting to gather accurate information. Perhaps we can start with your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Diet? It's… normal. I eat when I’m hungry. Breakfast is usually just coffee. Sometimes a small piece of toast if I have time. Lunch is… whatever's quick. Maybe a sandwich. And dinner… usually something my wife makes. I don't really pay attention to what it is. Just… food. I don't fuss about with all that… healthy eatin’ nonsense. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: So, predominantly coffee and relatively small portions of food throughout the day. Mr. Hartness, do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No! What are you… insinuating? I eat just fine. Always have. I can eat a whole plate of food if I wanted to. You're starting to make me nervous, Doctor. This isn't about the military anymore, is it? Are you trying to tell me I’m… sick?
DOCTOR: Please, Mr. Hartness, I am simply trying to gather information. It's my job to rule out potential issues. Difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your appetite or weight, could indicate a variety of problems. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss? No. I weigh the same as I always have. Maybe a little less during the summer, when it's hot, but that's just… water weight. Look, are we going to do this exam or not? I’ve got things to do, you know. I don’t have time for… guessing games. And I resent the implication that I'm not lookin' after myself. My wife worries about me enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, your answers are concerning. Your reported weight, coupled with your dietary habits, suggest a potential issue that needs to be investigated. However, proceeding with the military physical in this state… isn't advisable. I am obligated to recommend a full workup, including blood tests to assess your nutritional status and a thorough evaluation of your overall health. I also strongly advise a consultation with a registered dietitian. Until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on, I cannot ethically sign off on your military exam. Are you willing to pursue these recommendations?
PATIENT: Are you serious? You're telling me I can't take the exam because I'm… too lean? This is ridiculous! I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life. And you want to put me through… tests and consultations? For what? Because I don't eat enough… fancy food? My wife is going to hear about this. This is a waste of my time and money. I came here for a simple check-up, not a… medical interrogation! No. I will not be pursuing these recommendations. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions about my health. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I must prioritize your health. I cannot in good conscience sign off on a physical exam knowing there are potential underlying concerns that haven't been addressed. I've written down the contact information for a registered dietitian and a local internist. Please, consider scheduling an appointment. Your health is far more important than a military exam. If you experience any unexplained fatigue, weakness, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Mr. Hartness. .
