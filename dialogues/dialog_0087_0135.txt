DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my ear. It is… leaking something. A small amount, but it is happening. It started, let me think… about three days ago, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’ve noticed some discharge from your ear for the past three days. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. It is… not a lot, like I said. The color… it is a pale yellow. And it does not smell, thankfully. It is also… a bit thick, not watery. It comes out when I… when I move my head a certain way, or if I push gently on the ear. Is that… helpful information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, thank you. Pale yellow, thick discharge, and it occurs with movement or gentle pressure. Do you have any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. That is good, yes? Sometimes a little… fullness, like something is inside, but no sharp pain or anything like that. It is mostly just… uncomfortable. And a little worrying, of course. I have never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just a feeling of fullness and discomfort. That's good to know. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ear along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hearing… it feels a little quieter, maybe? But I am an older man, Doctor, and I do not hear as well as I once did. It is hard to say if it is worse than usual, or if it is just… my ears. No ringing, though. Definitely no ringing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No ringing, possible slight hearing decrease, but hard to quantify. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms like a cough or sore throat recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. I feel… normal otherwise. No cough, no sore throat. Just this ear. I have been eating and sleeping normally, I assure you. I do not feel sick, just… concerned about the leaking. Is it serious, Doctor? I hope it is nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No systemic symptoms. I'm going to take a quick look at your ear now, if that's alright with you. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I will try to stay very still. It is… it is a little strange to have someone look inside one's ear, but I trust your expertise. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I've taken a look. It appears there’s some inflammation in your ear canal and I do see the discharge you described. Your eardrum looks a little cloudy, but I can still see the light reflex, which is good. It’s likely you have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer’s ear. Have you been swimming recently, or had any water exposure in your ears?
PATIENT: Ah, swimmer’s ear, you say? No, Doctor, I have not been swimming. I do not swim at all. And I have been very careful to keep water out of my ears when I shower. I… I do use cotton swabs to dry them afterwards, though. Is that… bad? Perhaps that is what caused it? I always thought it was a good idea, to keep them clean and dry.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking about potential causes. While keeping the ear clean is important, using cotton swabs can actually push wax further into the ear canal and irritate the skin, potentially leading to an infection. It’s best to avoid them if possible. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, otitis externa is the most likely diagnosis. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. They’re fairly straightforward to use. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ah, I see. So the cotton swabs were not helpful, even though I meant well. Thank you for telling me, Doctor. I will certainly stop using them. Allergies… let me think. No, I do not believe so. I have no known allergies to any medications. I took some antibiotics a few years ago for a… a chest infection, and I did not have any problems with those. But nothing else comes to mind. I am usually very careful about what I take, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, I’m going to write you a prescription for ciprofloxacin ear drops. You'll need to use them twice a day for seven days. It’s important to complete the full course of treatment, even if your symptoms start to improve before then. Here are the instructions: 1. Warm the ear drops to room temperature by holding the bottle in your hand for a few minutes. 2. Tilt your head to the side, so the affected ear is facing up. 3. Gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. 4. Instill 2-3 drops into your ear canal. 5. Stay tilted for a few minutes to allow the drops to flow in. Do you have any questions about how to use them?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is very clear. Twice a day for seven days, even if it feels better. Warm them, tilt my head, pull my ear… yes, I think I can manage that. Let me see… is it alright to lie down when I do it? Or is it better to stay sitting up? And… what if some of the drops come out afterwards? Is that a problem? I always worry about doing things correctly, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Radillo. It's good you're thinking about these details. Lying down is perfectly fine, actually it can help keep the drops in the ear canal longer. And if some of the drops come out, don’t worry about it. Just try to stay tilted for a few more minutes, and if possible, gently press on the tragus—that’s the little flap in front of your ear—to help the drops penetrate. I’d like you to follow up with me in one week to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms worsen at any point before then—if you develop a fever, severe pain, or notice any drainage from your ear—please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Press on the tragus… yes, I remember that. You have explained everything very clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what to do. No, I do not think I have any other questions. You have been very thorough and kind. I appreciate your patience with my many questions. I will be sure to follow up in one week, and I will contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
