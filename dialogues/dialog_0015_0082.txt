DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... morning. Travel... yeah. I need... shots? For travel. My wife... she always took care of this. I don’t... remember where we go. Somewhere hot, I think. Lots of bugs.
DOCTOR: “Somewhere hot with lots of bugs…” Right. Well, that narrows it down… somewhat. To give you the correct vaccinations, I’ll need a bit more information. Do you recall when you're traveling?
PATIENT: August… sometime. Soon. Maybe next week? Or the week after. It’s… hard to remember. Everything is… fuzzy. She booked it. Always booked it. I just… went.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Soon” isn’t very specific, Mr. Tayar. It's important to know the exact dates to ensure you receive the proper protection in time. Do you have any travel documents – a plane ticket, itinerary, or even an email confirmation – that might list the dates and destination?
PATIENT: Email? I… I don’t check email. She did everything with the computer. I have… the passport, I guess. Here. Does that help? It has my picture... and her name.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is helpful. Let's see… Nepal, departing August 12th. Kathmandu, arriving August 14th. Returning September 5th. Okay, Nepal. That changes things. Have you traveled to Nepal before?
PATIENT: Nepal... yes. Many times. With her. But… it’s different now, right? She didn’t… she didn’t come with me this time. Always booked the shots before. I just... went.
DOCTOR: Yes, traveling alone does change things, especially regarding your medical history and any potential exposures. It's good you're getting this checked now. Now, to make sure we cover everything, let’s go through a quick health screening. Have you had any recent illnesses – fever, cough, diarrhea – in the past month?
PATIENT: Illnesses… not really. Just… sad. A lot of sad. I eat less now. Maybe that’s an illness? No fever. No cough. Just… tired. Very, very tired.
DOCTOR: And how would you rate your appetite, on a scale of one to ten, with one being no appetite at all and ten being normal?
PATIENT: One. Maybe two on a good day. Food doesn't taste the same anymore. Everything reminds me… Never mind. It’s just… one. Very little.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Yes. Clothes... too big. I didn’t even notice until… someone said something. She always said I ate too much. Now... it’s just… less. Everything is less.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tayar. While the travel vaccinations are important, these changes – loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue – are concerning. Before we discuss shots, I need to ask some additional questions to rule out other potential issues. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Bowel... habits? I don’t talk about things like that. She... the doctor, she asked. But… everything is different now. I just... less. Less of everything. I guess… maybe a little… looser? Sometimes. But I don’t know.
DOCTOR: "Looser" can be a significant symptom, Mr. Tayar. It’s important you feel comfortable discussing this with me. Now, have you noticed any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little… ache. Not all the time. Just… comes and goes. Like a… a knot. But I don’t like to complain. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand this is difficult, but it's crucial I get a complete picture of your health. This combination of symptoms – the appetite loss, weight loss, fatigue, altered bowel habits, abdominal discomfort – could indicate a number of things. While the travel vaccinations are still important, we need to investigate this further before administering them. I'm concerned about possible infection or other underlying medical conditions. I want to order some blood work and a stool sample. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Stool… sample? What for? Is it… bad? Is something wrong with me? I just want the shots. To go… visit. She wanted me to go…
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your anxiety. The tests are not to confirm anything is severely wrong, but to gather information. They will help rule out potential causes for your symptoms, like an infection or a digestive issue, so we can provide the most appropriate care. It’s standard procedure when someone presents with these changes. Think of it as being thorough. We can’t just administer vaccinations if there’s a possibility of an underlying health problem that needs to be addressed first. We need to rule out things that could impact your ability to travel safely and effectively. And, frankly, to ensure your well-being. Would you like me to explain the process for the blood work and stool sample in more detail?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. She always said I was a bad patient. Always complaining. I just want to go. Is it… painful? The blood work? And… a stool… Fine. Do whatever you need. Just… tell me when. And… make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. I understand this isn't pleasant, but it's necessary. The blood work involves a simple needle prick, and you may feel a brief sting. We’ll collect a small stool sample, which you can do at home with a kit our staff will provide. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and then I’ll give you the kit for the stool sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to order a basic travel vaccine package – Hepatitis A and Typhoid – which are generally safe to administer even with your current symptoms, but we'll re-evaluate based on the lab results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Whatever. Just… get it over with. She would have known what to do. I don’t understand any of this. Just… tell me where to go for the… prick. And the… other thing.
DOCTOR: The lab technician is just down the hall, in room three. They will explain the process. After that, I'll have the nurse bring you the stool sample collection kit and instructions. We’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available, likely in three to five business days. Mr. Tayar, I also recommend considering some brief counseling to help cope with your loss. This change in your health, coupled with your recent bereavement, may be contributing to your symptoms. We have resources available here at the clinic. Would you like me to provide you with information on that as well?
PATIENT: No. No counseling. I just want the shots. And to go. Just… let me go. I don't need... that. Just the blood and… the thing. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tayar. If you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to ask. The nurse will be right with you to assist with the bloodwork. .
