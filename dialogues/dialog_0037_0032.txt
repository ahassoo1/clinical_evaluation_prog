DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. KROK. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a rather delicate matter, truthfully. Something I’d hoped to avoid discussing, but… well, it is rather bothersome. A discharge, you see. From… down there. It’s not a pleasant topic, is it? And frankly, I haven’t the slightest idea why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t, Mr. KROK, but it’s a common one. And you've come to the right place. We can certainly figure out what’s going on. To help me understand, could you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well… it’s been occurring for, oh, some time now. A week, perhaps? Though my memory isn't what it once was, you understand. It’s… yellowish, I believe. And… rather… slippery. It’s not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. I’ve not… indulged in any… activities recently, if you catch my meaning. My wife, bless her soul, would be most displeased.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. KROK. And thank you for sharing that information – it’s very helpful. A week of yellowish discharge, and no recent sexual activity. Is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. A faint one. Not… overpowering, mind you. But… not entirely pleasant. A bit… fishy, perhaps? Though I hesitate to use such a crude descriptor. It’s difficult to pinpoint, really. My sense of smell isn’t as keen as it used to be, either. Everything seems to blend together these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint, fishy odor. Thank you. Has there been any change in your urinary habits – any burning, increased frequency, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t believe so. No burning, no… what was that word? Frequent… going to the lavatory? No, everything seems… normal in that regard. Though, as I said, my memory is rather unreliable. I do get up once or twice at night, but that's simply a matter of age, I assure you. A man can't help getting older, can he?
DOCTOR: No, a man certainly can’t. Getting up once or twice at night is quite common at your age, Mr. KROK. Just trying to rule things out. And have you noticed any itching, redness, or sores in the area?
PATIENT: Itching… now, there has been a bit of… irritation, yes. Not constant, mind you. Just occasionally. A slight… chafing, perhaps. Redness… I hadn’t really paid it much attention, if I’m honest. I don’t examine myself down there with the… thoroughness you might expect. I’m a practical man, Doctor, not a… a diagnostician.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. KROK. No need to apologize. Occasional irritation and some redness. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question. Medical history… let me see. Well, I’ve had the usual aches and pains of a man my age. Arthritis in the knees, mostly. And a touch of high blood pressure, years ago. Treated with… pills, I believe. I can’t recall the name of them. I also had my prostate examined a few years back, but they said it was just… enlarged. Nothing to worry about, they claimed. I’m insured with Medicare, if that's relevant. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve seen quite a few doctors in my time, and they all ask the same questions.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. KROK. Medicare is relevant, and thank you for mentioning the prior prostate exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't believe so. Never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. My wife always prepares my meals, and she’s very careful about ingredients. I avoid shellfish, as a matter of preference, not allergy. Gives me indigestion, you see. No, I can’t think of anything… No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… ah, yes. Here. I take a small pill each morning for the arthritis. And another one at night for my… well, for being an old man, I suppose. The doctor prescribed them, but I can’t recall the names. They're both white, smallish pills. And I take a multivitamin, just to keep my strength up. My wife reminds me every day, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It looks like one is likely ibuprofen for the arthritis and the other appears to be a tamsulosin, often prescribed for prostate issues. Do you recall ever having any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that is a question. Let me think… yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And I had a… a hemorrhoidectomy, many years ago. Also not particularly enjoyable. But other than those two… no, I can’t recall any other surgeries. Though, as I’ve said, my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. KROK. Alright, just a few more questions to get a full picture. Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a long story. My father had… heart trouble, I believe. Died young, unfortunately. My mother lived to a ripe old age, but she suffered from… arthritis, just like me. My brother… well, he emigrated to America many years ago and I haven’t heard from him since. No history of anything… down there, if that's what you're asking. My wife's family… fairly healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much of a family history man. We weren’t close, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. KROK. Thank you for what you’ve shared. Now, and this is a little sensitive, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What exactly do you mean by that, Doctor? Are you asking about… about my lifestyle? Because I assure you, I live a very… quiet life. I spend most of my time tending to my garden, reading, and… spending time with my wife. We’ve been married for sixty years, you know. A very… respectable marriage. I’m not much of a drinker, and I certainly don't smoke. I have never… indulged in any… questionable activities. Is that what you were asking? Honestly, I find the question rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question made you uncomfortable, Mr. KROK. It’s standard practice to ask about these things to get a full picture of a patient’s health. I was simply inquiring about things like alcohol or tobacco use, and whether you have any active sexual partners. It helps us understand potential causes for your symptoms. It sounds like you live a very healthy lifestyle, and that’s excellent. Since you’ve clarified that you’re not sexually active and don't use tobacco or alcohol, that’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve checking your vital signs and a gentle examination of the area causing you concern. It’s necessary to determine the cause of the discharge and the irritation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh dear. That… that is rather… awkward. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, be gentle. And… and quick, if you would. I’m not a fan of… being prodded and poked, you understand. And I would appreciate it if you could explain everything beforehand. I’m an old man, Doctor, and I’m… sensitive, you see. Just please… be respectful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. KROK. I completely understand. I will be as gentle and respectful as possible, and I'll explain each step before I do it. We'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll need to examine the area causing you concern. I’ll ask you to lie down on the examination table, and I'll use a gloved hand to gently feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also take a look at the discharge, if possible. It shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. If you’re ready, we can proceed. If you'd prefer to take a moment to gather your thoughts, that's perfectly fine as well.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let’s… get this over with. But please, do be quick. And gentle. I repeat: gentle. This is most… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. KROK. Please lie back and relax as much as possible. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs and checking your blood pressure. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/85, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your age. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to gently examine the area. I'm noting some mild redness around the urethral opening. There is slight tenderness to palpation. I observe a small amount of yellowish discharge present. No noticeable masses or lesions. Do you feel any pain with that palpation?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little discomfort. Not… excruciating, mind you. But noticeable. It's… sensitive, you see. As I said, I'm not a young man anymore. And please, be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I'm being as careful as possible. I'm not noting any inguinal lymphadenopathy – your lymph nodes are not swollen. Alright, Mr. KROK. That concludes the physical exam. Based on the findings – the yellowish discharge, the redness, the tenderness, and the absence of swollen lymph nodes – my initial suspicion is urethritis. This is an inflammation of the urethra, often caused by a bacterial infection, but it can also be caused by other factors. To confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture. The urinalysis will check for signs of infection, such as white blood cells and bacteria. The urine culture will identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection, if any. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Urethritis… a urine culture… Oh dear. Are these… serious? Will I require… hospitalization? And what about the… embarrassment of providing a sample? I’m a modest man, Doctor. This is all rather… unsettling. Is this common at my age? And what caused this? I haven’t… done anything to warrant such an affliction, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. KROK. Let's address them one by one. Urethritis itself isn't usually serious, but it’s important to treat it to prevent complications. Hospitalization is very unlikely. The vast majority of cases are treated with antibiotics as an outpatient. Regarding providing a sample, we have a private collection room and detailed instructions to ensure your comfort and privacy. It’s a standard procedure, and we have staff trained to assist you if needed. As for the cause, in your case, given your history of no recent sexual activity, it’s less likely to be a sexually transmitted infection. It could be caused by bacteria naturally present in the urinary tract, or potentially related to prostate enlargement causing incomplete bladder emptying, which can allow bacteria to accumulate. The urinalysis and urine culture will help us pinpoint the exact cause and guide treatment. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Well… yes, that’s slightly reassuring. The lack of hospitalization is… welcome news. And the explanation regarding my prostate… that makes some sense, I suppose. I do get up several times at night. So, I need to provide a… sample. And then you’ll prescribe some… pills? Are there any side effects? And how long will this take? I have a garden to tend, you know. And my wife is expecting me for tea. This is all rather… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to provide a urine sample. And then, once the results are back—usually within 48-72 hours—we can start you on antibiotics if an infection is confirmed. As for side effects, antibiotics can sometimes cause mild nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. Rarely, they can cause more serious side effects, but we'll discuss those potential risks in detail before starting treatment. The typical course of antibiotics is 7-10 days. While taking the medication, it's important to drink plenty of fluids to help flush out the infection. It shouldn't significantly disrupt your gardening, but you might feel a bit tired initially. I'll also recommend a follow-up appointment in a week to ensure the treatment is effective. To begin, I’ll have a nurse explain the urine collection process and provide you with the necessary containers. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… please, be as discreet as possible. This is… a rather delicate matter. And I trust the nurse will be… understanding. I’m an old man, you see, and… well, I’m a bit embarrassed by all of this. Very well, let’s proceed. But please, send the nurse along promptly. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. KROK. I understand completely, and I’ll ensure everything is handled with the utmost discretion and sensitivity. I’ll call the nurse immediately. She is very experienced and will guide you through the process with kindness and understanding. “Nurse, could you please come to room three?
PATIENT: Very well… let's get this over with.
