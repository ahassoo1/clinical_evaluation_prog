DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. Yeah. I… need some… shots? For travel. My wife… she booked it. Before… before she… She did all the planning. I just… I just need to get it done. I don't really know what for, though. Somewhere hot, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Odell. It's common for travel vaccinations to be organized by someone else. No worries at all. To make sure I can recommend the right vaccinations for you, could you tell me where you're traveling to?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I don't remember the name of the place. She had a… a map, with a little pin stuck in it. It was… near the water? Lots of palm trees, I think. She liked warm places. Everything’s… fuzzy. It was a long flight, that much I know. And… expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's understandable. We can still figure this out. Even a general idea of the region would be helpful. Was it in Asia, Africa, South America…?
PATIENT: Ugh… Asia, maybe? Yeah… I think so. She said… something about temples. And… spicy food. Definitely spicy food. Lots of people… small people. Is that… helpful? It all feels like a dream now, to be honest. A really expensive dream.
DOCTOR: Okay, Asia is a good starting point. And temples and spicy food narrows it down a bit. To help me pinpoint the necessary vaccinations, could you tell me when you're traveling?
PATIENT: When…? Oh, jeez. That’s… that’s a good question. Soon? She booked it… a while ago. I think… next month? Or maybe the month after? I really don’t know. She handled all the dates and… and everything. I just… packed my bags when she told me to. I’m not very good with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all, Odell. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, and it's perfectly okay to not have all the details. Since we're working with a potential trip to Asia within the next one to two months, and without a specific destination, let’s be cautious and cover some common recommendations. Have you had a tetanus shot within the last ten years?
PATIENT: Tetanus…? Uh… I think so? Maybe. I get… a lot of shots. For work, you know? Building airplanes… lots of pointy things. But… ten years? I don’t… I don’t keep track. Does it matter? I feel fine. Never got sick from a pointy thing yet.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven't had any issues! It does matter because tetanus protection wears off over time. Since I don’t have a record of your last tetanus shot, and to be on the safe side, I recommend a booster today. It's a routine shot, and it’s good to be up-to-date. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Another shot? Seriously? I just said I get a lot of them! And for work, thank you very much. It’s important work! Look, if it's really important, fine. But I'm telling you, I probably already had it. Just… get it over with. But don't tell me it's going to hurt. I hate shots.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Odell. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s always best to be protected, even if you've had it before. It’s a small pinch, and it will be over before you know it. While I'm doing that, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Ugh. Okay, fine. Dust. I’m allergic to dust. And… sometimes my skin gets itchy. When it’s cold. That’s it. Nothing… serious. My wife always said I was lucky. She was the one with all the problems. She had… everything. Just… don’t use anything with… nuts. She said I’m sensitive to nuts. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and potential nut sensitivity. Good to know. And to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Nothing. I… I don’t get sick. Like I said, lucky. Maybe a headache sometimes. But I just… drink water. She always had a whole bag full of pills. For everything. Vitamins, and… and things. I never understood it. Just water for me. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Odell. I'm going to give you the tetanus booster now. Just a quick pinch. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. There you go. All done. It's normal to have a little soreness at the injection site for a day or two. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ow! See? I told you it would hurt! It stings. And it feels… warm. Like a little fire. Is that… is that it? Just one shot? Because if I have to get more, I’m leaving. Honestly. Just… tell me I’m done. Please.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the discomfort, Odell. I know it wasn’t pleasant. It’s normal for it to sting and feel warm for a little while. Based on what you’ve told me, and to be cautious given the potential travel to Asia, I also recommend checking your immunity to Hepatitis A and Typhoid. These are food and waterborne illnesses common in some parts of Asia. We can do a quick blood test to see if you’re already immune. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood test?! Are you serious? More poking and prodding? Look, I just wanted a shot. My wife said I needed shots. I got a shot. Now you want blood? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I don't even know where I'm going! Just… forget it. I’m done. I'll… I'll risk getting sick. It's probably just a cold anyway. Thank you for nothing. I need some water. And a vacation from this vacation. .
DOCTOR: Odell, please wait. I understand your frustration, but I am genuinely concerned about your health, especially with potential travel involved. While I respect your decision, I strongly advise reconsidering the blood tests. They are a simple precaution to ensure you are adequately protected. I can provide you with a list of travel clinics that might be better suited if you prefer a different approach. They can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail. Here’s my card. Please call if you change your mind. And if you start experiencing any fever, abdominal pain, or jaundice after your trip, please seek immediate medical attention. I wish you safe travels, Odell. .
