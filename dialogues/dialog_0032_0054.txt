DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Sorry, I… cough a lot. Been coughing for a long time now. And I get tired easy. And my nose… always feels blocked, like a cold, but it doesn't go away. I think I get it a lot. My wife told me to come.
DOCTOR: A persistent cough and fatigue, along with nasal congestion… Alright. “A long time now” is rather vague, Mr. Tati. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. Maybe… six months? Or more? I dunno, Doctor. Time… gets away from me sometimes. It’s just… always there. The cough, the tired… it comes and goes, but it always comes back. I work, you know? Change tires… it’s hard work. Maybe that makes it worse?
DOCTOR: Changing tires is certainly physically demanding. However, a cough lasting six months or more is… concerning. We need to determine the cause. Do you recall if anything started the cough?
PATIENT: Started it…? That’s a hard one. I think… maybe after a bad flu? A long time ago. But I get colds a lot, so I can’t really remember. It just… slowly got worse. Not like boom suddenly bad, just… always a little worse. I don’t know if that helps?
DOCTOR: It's helpful, Mr. Tati, though a precise timeline is always preferable. And have you noticed anything that makes the cough better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. When it's cold, definitely worse. And dusty. Changing tires… a lot of dust. Better…? Not much, really. Maybe when I rest? But I don't get much rest, Doctor. Work is work, you know? My wife makes me drink warm tea, sometimes. Maybe that helps a little bit. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Cold weather and dust exacerbate the symptoms, rest provides minimal relief, and warm tea… a folk remedy, but we’ll note it. Now, let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever…? Not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing bad. No chills, no… night sweats? What are night sweats? And weight loss… I don't know. I eat, you know? My wife cooks good food. I haven't… weighed myself in a long time. Sorry. I just… feel tired all the time. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No significant fever, chills, or night sweats. Unintentional weight loss is uncertain. Fatigue is present, as you’ve mentioned. Alright, Mr. Tati. Now, do you have any difficulty breathing, wheezing, or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? No, not really. Sometimes, when I cough really hard, it hurts a little in my chest, but it goes away. No… wheezing? What’s wheezing? Breathing… sometimes it feels a little tight, like I can’t get enough air, but it’s okay. It happens when I’m working hard, I think. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's important to be precise, Mr. Tati. "A little tight" is not a helpful description. Does this shortness of breath interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It does… sometimes. When I'm changing tires, especially if it's hot. I have to stop and rest more. My wife gets worried. She says I look too tired. It doesn't stop me from working, but… it's harder. I have to push myself more. Is that what you mean, Doctor? The… pushing myself?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. You are experiencing exertional dyspnea – shortness of breath with activity. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung condition?
PATIENT: Lung condition…? No, not that I know of. I… haven’t been to the doctor much. Just… small things. Colds, maybe. My wife takes me to the clinic sometimes when I’m really bad. But they just give me medicine for the cold. No… asthma, bronchitis… no, never been told that. I don't think so. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is pertinent information, Mr. Tati. And have you ever had tuberculosis, or been exposed to anyone with tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Tuberculosis…? No! No, I don't think so. What is tuberculosis? Is it… serious? I… I don't know anything about that. My wife… she’s from a village, maybe? She told me stories… about people being sick… a long time ago. But I don't know if it was tuberculosis. No, I haven't been around anyone sick, not that I know of. This is… scary, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s a serious infectious disease, Mr. Tati, but we are simply gathering information. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have a history of lung problems, asthma, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: My mother… she coughed a lot when she was old. But she died a long time ago. I don't know what she had. My father… he was strong. Never sick. I have a sister… she lives far away. I haven't seen her in years. I don't know about her. No, I don't think so. No one that I know of had lung problems… or asthma. I’m sorry, Doctor. I don’t know much about my family's health. It's… not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your social history, Mr. Tati. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No! No smoking. Never. My wife… she would kill me if I smoked. It’s bad for you, you know? No, no smoking. I drink… sometimes. A little beer with my friends after work. But not much. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption is minimal. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife cooks a lot of different things. Sometimes my skin gets itchy if I’m in the dust, but that’s not an allergy, right? No, I don’t think so. No allergies. I’m pretty healthy, Doctor. Just… tired and coughing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. Now, I’m going to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and examine your throat and nose. Please remove your shirt and sit back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is it… bad? Is something really wrong? I just want to feel better. My wife… she worries so much.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Tati. We are simply gathering information. Now, take a deep breath… and exhale. … Okay, another deep breath… and exhale. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and I do hear some wheezing in your lower lobes bilaterally. Your heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Your throat is mildly inflamed, and there’s some nasal congestion, as you’ve mentioned. Your nasal passages are swollen and congested. Your oxygen saturation is 95% which is acceptable, but borderline.
PATIENT: Wheezing…? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? And what does “borderline” mean? I don't understand. Is it my lungs? Am I… sick? My wife is going to be so worried.
DOCTOR: Wheezing indicates narrowing of the airways, Mr. Tati. It suggests inflammation or obstruction in your lungs. “Borderline” oxygen saturation means your levels are not optimal, but not critically low. It’s a concerning finding, which is why we need to investigate further. It could be your lungs, but we need to determine the cause. Now, I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count to assess your lung health and rule out any infection. We’ll also perform a sputum test to check for bacteria or other pathogens. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Sputum test…? What if it’s something bad, Doctor? What if… what if it’s tuberculosis? My wife… she told me stories… about people being sick… and… and… I don't want an X-ray. I don't want a test. Is there anything else we can do? Please, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand your anxiety, but we need to gather information to determine the cause of your symptoms. An X-ray is a simple, non-invasive procedure that will help us visualize your lungs and rule out serious conditions. The sputum test will identify any potential infection. Avoiding these tests will not make your symptoms disappear; it will only delay diagnosis and potentially allow the condition to worsen. Now, I strongly advise you to proceed with these tests. I’m going to write you a referral to the radiology department and a requisition for the sputum test. You can schedule the X-ray at your convenience. I also want to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open your airways and alleviate your wheezing. It’s a temporary measure to provide you with some relief, but it doesn't address the underlying cause. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I… I just want to feel better. My wife… she’ll be relieved if I just do what the doctor says. Bronchodilator… inhaler… X-ray… sputum test… Okay. Can I… can I go home now? I feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the prescription for the bronchodilator. Use it as directed. And here are the referrals for the X-ray and sputum test. The radiology department will schedule your appointment. I recommend you schedule these tests as soon as possible. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. And if your symptoms worsen, particularly if you experience severe shortness of breath or chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No strenuous activity… emergency room… Thank you, Doctor. I… I should go now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Tati. And please, follow the instructions. .
