DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. It’s this tiredness. Just… dragging. And it’s not like I’ve been doing anything to be tired, you know? And… well, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but I crave it. Clay, mostly. Don’t look at me like that. It's just...happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand. You're experiencing significant fatigue, and you've also been having cravings for clay. That’s…unusual, but we’ll figure out what's going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Unusual? It’s ridiculous, that’s what it is. I’ve lived a long life, never felt like this. It’s not just being sleepy, it’s… everything feels heavy. Like wading through water. It started a few months ago, I guess. Slow creep. And I’m not one to complain. I keep myself busy, you know? Little gardening, some light cleaning… but even those things are exhausting now. I used to be able to go all day. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slow onset of fatigue over the last few months, impacting your usual activities. And you said it feels like everything is heavy, like wading through water. That’s a helpful description. Can you tell me if this fatigue is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, but it gets worse in the afternoons. Like someone just flips a switch. Mornings are… tolerable. I can get a few things done. But by two, three o’clock? Ugh. I just have to sit. And then, sometimes, that's when I… feel the urge. For the clay, I mean. It doesn’t help, mind you. Just… distracts me for a bit. Is this going somewhere or are we just going to talk about my habits now?
DOCTOR: We are definitely going somewhere, Ms. Hardenburgh. We're trying to understand why this is happening. The clay craving is important information, it could be a clue. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think. I’ve been a little… forgetful, I suppose. Not like… serious memory problems, but I misplace things more. My glasses, mostly. Which is annoying, since I need them to see! And… my appetite’s been off. Not that I have a huge appetite to begin with. I don’t really feel hungry, even when I know I should eat. Honestly, everything feels… muted. Colors aren't as bright, food doesn't taste as good. It’s just… dull.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased forgetfulness, decreased appetite, and a general sense of things feeling “muted” – dull colors, decreased taste. Those are all things we need to consider. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Really? You're asking me about that now? Honestly. I don’t discuss these things. But fine, if you must know, they’re… irregular. Sometimes fine, sometimes… not. Never been a regular person, to be honest. Though, it's gotten worse lately. And don’t look at me like that. It's a perfectly normal question, I suppose, but… embarrassing. Is this leading somewhere or are we just collecting unpleasant details?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I made you uncomfortable, Ms. Hardenburgh. These questions are necessary to get a complete picture of what's going on. Irregular bowel movements are important information. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well… I haven’t been weighing myself, not regularly. But my clothes are a little looser, I suppose. Not much. I’m already thin as a rail, you know? Never been a big woman. But yes, probably a little. Don’t tell me I’m wasting away, please. I don’t need that negativity. I'm perfectly fine, just tired and… peculiar. This is all very ridiculous. Are you going to test me for something or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss is another piece of the puzzle. We will do some tests, Ms. Hardenburgh. I want to check your blood counts, thyroid function, iron levels, and vitamin D. And we will also check for any nutritional deficiencies, given your clay cravings. Before we order those tests, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? No. Never had any of that nonsense. I’ve always been… healthy. A little arthritis in my hands, getting old, you know. But nothing serious. I’ve never been one for doctors, honestly. Always figured I could handle things myself. I used to be very active, walking for miles every day. Now… well, you see. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no high blood pressure. Just… this. Is this finally getting somewhere or am I just recounting my life story?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, you’re not just recounting your life story – it’s all important information. No chronic conditions, just some arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think. Just my tonsils, when I was a little girl. Ages ago. And a hysterectomy, when I was…oh, goodness, probably forty? That’s it. Nothing else. Very simple procedures, nothing major. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Until now. Honestly, all these questions are making me tired. Can we please get this over with? I have a garden that needs tending. Well, used to need tending. Before all this.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, we're getting there. Tonsillectomy and hysterectomy, both in the past. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my sister… she had some sort of trouble with her stomach, but I don’t remember exactly what. It was ages ago. Nothing major, really. We weren’t a particularly sickly family. Mostly just… stubborn people. Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with me eating dirt. Are we getting closer to a diagnosis or are you just trying to bore me to death with questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Ms. Hardenburgh. And you’re right to ask. We are working towards a diagnosis. We need to rule out several possibilities. Now, let's quickly go over your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No! I don't believe in all that stuff. Never taken a pill in my life, if I could help it. Well, maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. No supplements, no vitamins, nothing. Just… me. And as for allergies, I think I'm allergic to dust, maybe? A little sniffly sometimes, but nothing serious. Honestly, this is all very ridiculous. I just want to feel better. Can we please, please get to the tests now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, we are almost there. No medications, just occasional aspirin. Allergy to dust. Okay. Now, one last quick question. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the kind of woman who would do any of those things? I’ve always been a very… proper lady. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and I certainly don’t smoke. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! Honestly, I’m quite offended you even asked. Now, can we finally get to these tests? I'm wasting daylight!
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, absolutely. I apologize for the many questions, I assure you it’s all necessary. No alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, the fatigue, the clay cravings – a condition called pica – the irregular bowel movements, weight loss, and decreased appetite, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. We need to rule out iron deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and potentially malabsorption issues. I’m going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, thyroid function tests, vitamin D level, B12 level, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We’ll also check a stool sample for any signs of malabsorption. I’ll also order a Celiac panel, just to rule that out. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Just… do the tests. Honestly, the more you explain, the more confused I get. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. I suppose… if you insist on explaining, just keep it short. And don’t use any fancy medical jargon. I'm a simple woman. Just… hurry up and get it over with. I have a feeling this is going to take all day. And honestly, I don't have that kind of time. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Or can I just go home and wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hardenburgh. The blood tests are standard – just a quick prick of the finger. We’ll need a stool sample – I’ll give you a kit and instructions on how to collect it at home. It just needs to be a small amount, and we'll send it to the lab. There's no special preparation needed for the blood tests – you can eat and drink as usual. The stool sample is the only thing you need to worry about. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to eat a balanced diet, even if you don't have a big appetite. And please, avoid eating any clay. I know it’s tempting, but it could be making things worse. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me the kit. And let me go home. I need to sit in my garden. Or what's left of it. Honestly, I'm starting to feel lightheaded. This whole experience is exhausting. Just...please, hurry up. I don't have much energy left. And don't expect me to call if I have questions. I won't. I'll just… deal with it. Is there anything else? Or can I finally leave?
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Hardenburgh. The instructions are very straightforward. And please, if you do have any concerns, don't hesitate to call the office. My staff will be happy to help. I'll have a nurse come in to take your vitals before you leave, just to make sure everything is okay. And please, if you experience any worsening symptoms – dizziness, weakness, or anything else – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. I hope you feel better soon, Ms. Hardenburgh. And please, try to get some rest. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… leave me alone now. I need to go home. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Hardenburgh. And please, take care. .
