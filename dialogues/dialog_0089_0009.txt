DOCTOR: Hi Delano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Alcorta is the name. It’s… well, it’s my vision, you see. It’s not what it used to be. And frankly, I find that rather… distressing. It’s a shame, really. A man needs his sight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alcorta. Vision changes, got it. And you said it's not what it used to be – can you tell me more about how it’s changed?
PATIENT: Well, it's difficult to articulate precisely. Things aren’t… sharp, anymore. A bit blurry, I suppose. And the colors… they don’t seem as vibrant. Everything looks rather… washed out. It's subtle, mind you, but noticeable to someone with my… discerning eye. I used to be able to spot a flaw in craftsmanship from twenty paces. Not so much these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, blurry vision and colors appearing washed out. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, certainly. It didn’t just… happen overnight. More of a slow fade, really. I suppose I should have come in sooner, but one doesn’t rush to complain about the inevitable decline of… well, everything. It's just bothersome now, when reading the paper, or looking at detailed things. It's… inconvenient, to put it mildly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual decline, impacting reading and detailed vision. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always had perfectly good eyesight, right up until… well, recently. My father had excellent vision his whole life, too. It’s… a family trait, you see. A good, strong lineage. It’s just… disappointing, this whole affair. I always took pride in not needing such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior corrective lenses and a family history of good vision. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I maintain a sensible diet, get plenty of rest, and avoid… common vices. I wouldn’t subject my body to unnecessary strain, Doctor. A man has to look after himself. Though, I will admit, I haven't been to a doctor in… some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, and you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Any allergies to medications, or medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And I take… well, nothing regularly. Perhaps an aspirin now and again for a headache, but that’s about it. I prefer to let my body heal naturally, if possible. These modern pharmaceuticals… I have my doubts about their long-term effects, you understand. Too much interference, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies and no regular medications. Have you had any eye injuries or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never a scratch, never a problem. I've always been… careful, you see. A man needs his eyes, and one doesn't go about endangering them needlessly. It’s just… baffling, this whole situation. If it isn’t injury, and it isn’t illness… what is it? I find myself increasingly concerned about the cause.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior eye injuries or surgeries. And you’ve said this came on gradually without any trauma. Let’s do a quick exam, Alcorta. I’m going to check your visual acuity, check your peripheral vision, and take a look at the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An ophthalmoscope, you say? Is that… invasive? I’m not fond of instruments poking around. But… very well. If it must be done. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And please explain what you're looking at, if you don't mind. I appreciate a thorough explanation. I'm a man who likes to understand these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Alcorta. It's not invasive at all. I'll just shine a light into your eye to look at the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels at the back of your eye. It won’t hurt, but I may need to get close. First, let’s check your vision. Could you please read the smallest line on this chart for each eye, one at a time?
PATIENT: Very well. Charts, you say? Always rather disliked standardized testing, if I’m being frank. But… proceed. I’ll do my best. Though, I suspect my results won’t be as… impressive as they once were. Cover one eye, you say? Yes, yes. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting with your right eye. Read me the smallest line you can see. … Okay, that's 20/30. Now, let’s try your left eye. Cover your right eye.
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… rather blurred. I can make out some of the letters, but… it's difficult. I’d say… perhaps 20/40? No, wait… 20/45. It’s hard to be certain. Everything seems… indistinct. This is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, 20/45 in your left eye. That confirms some vision loss. Now, let’s check your peripheral vision. I’m going to have you look straight ahead, and I'll present some objects in your side vision. Just tell me when you see something appear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Well, I suppose it's all part of the process. A thorough examination is… commendable. Yes, proceed. Look straight ahead, you say? Very well. I shall focus intently. Just… try not to startle me, Doctor. I have a rather sensitive disposition.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alcorta, just tell me when you first see something out of the corner of your eye. ...Okay. And now this side... Okay. Now, I'm going to use the ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eye. Just relax and look straight ahead. It will be a bright light, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: A bright light, you say? Very well. I shall endeavor to remain relaxed. Though, I must confess, I find medical instruments inherently… unsettling. Proceed with caution, Doctor. And please, do explain what you’re observing. I prefer to be kept informed. A man appreciates transparency, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alcorta. Looking at your optic nerve… it appears a little pale, which can indicate some nerve damage. The retina looks relatively clear, but I do see some small drusen – those are small deposits under the retina. They're common with age, but we’ll want to monitor them. The blood vessels look normal, no signs of bleeding or swelling. Okay, all done. It’s a quick exam, but it gives me a good starting point. Based on what I’m seeing, it seems like you have some early signs of age-related macular degeneration and possibly some optic nerve atrophy. The macular degeneration would explain the blurry central vision and the drusen I saw, and the atrophy could explain the pale optic nerve and some peripheral vision loss.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Atrophy? Those are… alarming terms, Doctor. Are we talking… blindness? I must confess, I'm rather distressed by this news. I always prided myself on my excellent health. And my vision… it’s been such an integral part of my life. And what… what does this mean? Is there anything… anything at all that can be done? I’d like to understand the full extent of the situation, Doctor. Please, don’t sugarcoat it. A man deserves honesty, even if the truth is unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Alcorta. Those terms do sound alarming, and I apologize for delivering such news. Let's break it down. Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a common condition that affects the central part of your vision. It doesn’t typically cause complete blindness, but it can lead to significant vision loss over time. There are two types: dry AMD and wet AMD. Based on what I'm seeing, you currently have the dry form, which progresses more slowly. The optic nerve atrophy could be contributing to some peripheral vision loss and is something we'll want to investigate further. Now, to answer your question about what can be done. For dry AMD, there's no cure, unfortunately. However, we can manage it to slow the progression. I recommend a high-dose vitamin and mineral supplement specifically formulated for AMD – AREDS2 formula. It’s been shown to reduce the risk of further vision loss. We will also want to regularly monitor your vision with visual acuity tests and potentially some imaging of the retina to track any changes. Regarding the optic nerve atrophy, I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more thorough evaluation. They may want to do some additional testing, such as an optical coherence tomography scan and a visual field test. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: AREDS2 formula… vitamins? That’s… rather underwhelming, Doctor. I was expecting… something more substantial. A procedure, perhaps? Some form of… intervention? Vitamins seem a rather… passive approach to such a serious condition. And an ophthalmologist, you say? More specialists? It seems I’m being passed around like… like a poorly-made commodity. Tell me, Doctor… what is the prognosis? What can I realistically expect in the coming years? Will I be able to continue reading? Driving? Enjoying… simple pleasures? These are… important considerations. I refuse to sit idly by while my vision deteriorates. I need… clarity.
DOCTOR: I understand your disappointment, Alcorta, and I apologize if my recommendations seem underwhelming. Unfortunately, for dry AMD, vitamins are currently the best evidence-based treatment to slow the progression. There are some experimental treatments in development, but they are not yet widely available. Regarding the referral to an ophthalmologist, it’s not about passing you around. An ophthalmologist is a specialist with more advanced training and equipment to evaluate your optic nerve and rule out other potential causes of vision loss. They can provide a more comprehensive assessment and personalized treatment plan. Now, to address your question about prognosis. It’s difficult to give a definitive answer, as the progression of AMD varies from person to person. However, with vitamins and regular monitoring, we can often slow the progression and preserve your vision for many years. Whether you'll be able to continue reading and driving depends on how quickly the AMD progresses. We will need to monitor your vision closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. If your vision deteriorates significantly, we can explore low-vision aids, such as magnifiers and special lighting, to help you continue to function. I want to be honest with you, Alcorta. There is a risk of further vision loss, but it’s not inevitable. By taking proactive steps, such as vitamins, regular monitoring, and a referral to an ophthalmologist, we can do our best to preserve your vision and maintain your quality of life. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable ophthalmologist in the area, as well as information on the AREDS2 formula and low-vision aids. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Very well. A referral to an ophthalmologist, then. And information on this… AREDS2 formula. Though, I remain skeptical. Tell me, Doctor… is there anything I can do to mitigate this decline? Aside from these vitamins? Diet? Exercise? Lifestyle changes? I refuse to be a passive recipient of this… unfortunate fate. I need to take control of the situation. And… what is the cost of these vitamins? I am… on a fixed income, you see. I need to be mindful of my finances.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alcorta. There are several things you can do to mitigate the decline. While vitamins are a good starting point, lifestyle changes can also play a significant role. Firstly, a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables – especially leafy greens like spinach and kale – and omega-3 fatty acids is beneficial. Studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet can help protect against AMD. Regular exercise is also important, as it improves blood circulation and overall health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Secondly, smoking is a major risk factor for AMD, so if you smoke, quitting is essential. Thirdly, protecting your eyes from ultraviolet light is crucial. Wear sunglasses that block 100% of UV-A and UV-B rays whenever you’re outdoors. Regarding the cost of the AREDS2 vitamins, it varies depending on the brand and where you purchase them. Generally, a one-month supply costs between $20 and $40. Some pharmacies offer generic versions that are more affordable. I can provide you with a list of pharmacies in the area that carry AREDS2 vitamins, and we can discuss options to help you find an affordable option. I also have some informational pamphlets on AMD and lifestyle changes that I can give you. Would you like those?
PATIENT: Pamphlets, yes. And the list of pharmacies, please. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. Though, I remain… guarded. This whole situation is… unsettling, to say the least. I suppose I should schedule an appointment with this ophthalmologist, then. Do you have any recommendations? Someone… experienced? Someone who understands the nuances of this… affliction? I’m not inclined to trust just anyone with my eyesight.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Alcorta. I completely understand your hesitation and desire to find an experienced ophthalmologist. I highly recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance at the Coastal Eye Center. She's a board-certified ophthalmologist specializing in macular degeneration and has a excellent reputation in the area. She’s very thorough and takes the time to explain things to her patients. Her number is 555-123-4567. I can also provide you with a referral form to expedite the appointment process. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that will be all for today. Thank you for your… assistance. Though, I remain cautiously optimistic. I suppose I shall schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance. And I’ll procure these vitamins. Good day, Doctor. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alcorta. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you all the best with your appointment and remember, early detection and proactive management are key. Have a good day. .
