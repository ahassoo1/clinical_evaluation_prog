DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, welcome. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… well, it's my stomach, I suppose. Lower part. It’s been bothering me again. It’s hard to explain… they’ve been coming and going, these pains. It's just… uncomfortable, really. And quite severe when they do come. I apologize, I don’t always remember details very well. It's something the other doctors have mentioned before.
DOCTOR: “Other doctors have mentioned…?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. About my… condition. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, I believe it's called? SLE, for short. I’ve seen a few specialists over the years. It’s been… a long time, you see. And I don’t always recall everything they said. It's… frustrating, to be honest. I try to remember, but it seems to slip away. I do know it affects my joints and… well, other things. But the stomach pain feels different than the usual aches.
DOCTOR: Right. SLE. Yes, I see that in your record. And you’re saying this stomach pain is new, or at least different than what you usually experience with your lupus?
PATIENT: Well, “new” isn't quite right. It feels familiar, in a way. Like it's happened before, but… not recently. And it’s more… intense. It’s a cramping, twisting sort of pain, low down. It comes in waves, you see? And sometimes it makes me feel quite nauseous. I'm not entirely sure what triggers it. It doesn't seem to be related to food, or anything specific I can pinpoint. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful with the details.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Waves of cramping pain… and nausea. And you haven’t been able to identify anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I’ve tried to pay attention, you see? I really have. I keep a little notebook, but… it’s not always very helpful. Sometimes I write things down and then forget why I wrote them! It’s quite embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed it seems to happen more often when I’m… stressed, perhaps? But truthfully, life is rather stressful, isn't it? It’s hard to say if that's the cause or just a coincidence.
DOCTOR: Stress. Yes, well, that could be a factor. Alright. Let’s do a quick examination. I'll need to palpate your abdomen, just to get a feel for things. Please lie back on the examination table. And try not to tense up. It helps me if you can relax.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It’s… a bit difficult for me to get around sometimes, you see? With my joints… but I’ll manage. Just let me know if I’m being… uncooperative. I do apologize in advance if I wince a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie flat. I’ll be gentle. And don’t worry about “uncooperative.” I’m used to patients having… sensitivities. Now, breathe normally. I’m going to press lightly on your abdomen in different areas. Tell me if you feel any pain, and where, specifically. We'll start here, on your right side.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here we go. Just let me know if there's anything… Oh! There… yes, that's a bit tender. Just below my ribs, I think. It's not sharp, more of a dull ache. And… it radiates a bit towards my back, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Radiating to the back… hmm. And how about here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… less painful. Still a little tender, but not like the other spot. It’s… hard to describe, Doctor. It's not a pain I want to feel, naturally. It's more like… awareness. I can feel you pressing, and it’s a bit uncomfortable, but not terribly painful. It’s… a strange sensation, really. I apologize if I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize. Just tell me what you’re feeling. Or not feeling. This spot here… any pain?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that’s… considerably more painful. Lower down, on my left side. It’s a cramping, twisting sensation, like… a knot being pulled tighter. It’s… quite uncomfortable, Doctor. And it makes me feel a little… dizzy, if I’m honest. Just for a moment, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just stay still. That's… significant. And how about the lower abdomen, in the center?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a bit sensitive as well. Not as bad as the left side, but… a dull ache, like a pressure. It’s hard to explain. It feels… swollen, perhaps? Although I haven’t looked, truthfully. It's a general discomfort, a feeling that something isn’t quite right. Are you… concerned, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Concerned is… a strong word. But your symptoms, combined with your history of SLE, are… noteworthy. It could be a flare-up of your lupus, affecting your gastrointestinal system. Or it could be something else entirely. We'll need to run some tests to determine the cause. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and a stool sample analysis. We should also consider imaging—an abdominal ultrasound, perhaps.
PATIENT: Oh… tests. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I do apologize for being such a… difficult patient. I always worry about being a burden. A stool sample… is that… unpleasant? And imaging… will it be painful? I’ve never had an ultrasound before. I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… let me know what to expect.
DOCTOR: It’s not about being a “difficult patient.” It’s about gathering information. The stool sample is… inconvenient. There are instructions in the lab. As for the ultrasound, it’s painless. A technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and use a probe to create images. It’s not invasive. We're ruling things out, Ms. Glymph. I'll write the orders for the lab and imaging. The lab will call you to schedule the appointments. And, frankly, given your history and these findings, I’m going to refer you to Dr. Chen, a gastroenterologist. She's much better equipped to handle these sorts of complexities.
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist… that sounds… sensible. Dr. Chen, you say? I suppose more eyes are better than one. I do hope she’s… patient. I sometimes struggle to articulate my symptoms clearly. And… will I need to fast before any of these tests? I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: The lab will provide specific instructions with the orders. Fasting requirements, if any, will be clearly stated. Don't worry about remembering everything; write it down. I'm printing the orders now. Here. The referral to Dr. Chen is included in this packet. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, are there any other concerns you’d like to discuss, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. A referral… and lab orders. Yes. I suppose… no, that’s all, Doctor. I just hope we can figure out what’s causing all this discomfort. And… thank you for your patience, despite my… forgetfulness. I appreciate your time. .
