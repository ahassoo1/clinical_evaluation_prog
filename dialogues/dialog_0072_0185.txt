DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I am Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't really have time for this, but my ex-husband keeps complaining about my breath. Says it smells… bad. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but he's being a nuisance and now I'm here. It's just… annoying, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating to be asked to come in for something that feels trivial, Ms. Ambris. However, changes in body functions – even those seemingly minor – can sometimes indicate underlying issues. It's my job to investigate, and I assure you, we'll do so efficiently. So, when did you first notice your ex-husband mentioning this odor?
PATIENT: Honestly? A few weeks ago, maybe? It's not like I'm trying to smell my best for him. We’re divorced, remember? It's just... he makes a big deal out of everything. I don't even know why he brought it up now, after all this time. It's not like I’ve changed anything in my routine.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anyone else mentioned anything about a change in your breath?
PATIENT: No. Just him. And frankly, I doubt his judgement. He always was… dramatic. Look, I work highway maintenance. It’s not exactly a perfume factory, you know? It’s dusty, dirty work. Maybe he just needs to get used to… reality.
DOCTOR: Highway maintenance, right. And how long have you been working in that field, Ms. Ambris?
PATIENT: About six months. It’s…physical. Lots of sun, lots of…being outside. Does that matter? Honestly, I’m starting to wonder why I even bothered coming in for this. It's probably just the job. Can we just… rule that out and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I understand your frustration, but I need to gather a complete history to ensure we're not overlooking anything. Six months is enough time for a change to become noticeable, and it is important to rule out other potential causes. Now, aside from the work environment, have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No. Same as always. Coffee, whatever I can grab quickly... sometimes a sandwich. It's not like I'm a gourmet chef, okay? I don't have time for fancy eating. Look, I eat to work, not for pleasure. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Like what? I'm not sick. I’m a perfectly healthy person. I work outside all day, I lift things, I’m fine. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Do I look like I'm unwell? Just tell me if it's the job and I'll buy some extra mouthwash. Can we please speed this up?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I appreciate your…forthrightness. However, a medical evaluation requires a systematic approach. I need to ask a few standard questions, even if they seem unrelated. Have you noticed any changes in your mouth – dryness, sores, unusual coating?
PATIENT: No. My mouth feels… normal. It’s a mouth. It gets dry sometimes, everyone’s mouth does! I don’t inspect my mouth all day, Doctor. Are we done yet? I have things to do. Seriously, I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No. None. Never had any. I'm pretty resilient, honestly. Look, I don’t even go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary, so I wouldn’t know if I had allergies. Is this going somewhere, or are we just making small talk? It feels like you're deliberately dragging this out.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I assure you, I am trying to be thorough. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No! Are you serious? I just told you I rarely go to the doctor! Why would I be taking a bunch of medication? Look, I take a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember, but that's it. Honestly, this is insulting. Do you think I'm completely clueless? Just tell me if it’s the job, okay? I'm losing patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Before we dismiss anything, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, focusing on your oral cavity and nasal passages. It will only take a few minutes, and it may help us determine the cause of this issue. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if it's nothing, I expect an apology for wasting my time. Honestly, I had a perfectly good afternoon planned. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Please open your mouth wide for me. Hmm… tongue appears slightly coated. Gums are… slightly inflamed, but no obvious lesions. No significant redness or swelling in the throat. Nasal passages appear clear, but… I do detect a slight odor. Alright. Now, can you say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ah. Happy? Can we please be done now? I’m starting to feel ridiculous. Honestly, this is…degrading.
DOCTOR: Alright. The odor is…distinct. Ms. Ambris, I suspect this is likely related to your occupation, as you mentioned. However, the coated tongue and mild gingivitis suggest a potential for poor oral hygiene contributing to the issue. I recommend increasing your fluid intake, maintaining meticulous oral hygiene – brushing twice daily and flossing – and consider using an antiseptic mouthwash. However, to rule out any underlying sinus infection or other medical causes, I would also recommend a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Are you kidding me? For bad breath? Absolutely not. I told you, it's the job. Dust, dirt, sun… It's not rocket science. Look, I'm not paying for a bunch of unnecessary tests just to prove something that's perfectly obvious. Just write it off as occupational hazard and let me go. Honestly, this is a complete waste of money and time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ambris. I respect your decision. However, I must document that I advised laboratory testing to rule out other potential causes. I will note "Suspected occupational odor, advise improved oral hygiene and increased fluid intake." I recommend you see a dentist for a professional cleaning and assessment of your gum health. If the odor persists despite these measures, I strongly urge you to reconsider testing. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
