DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day for this. It’s this tiredness, see. It’s just…getting worse. And I have this craving. It's…embarrassing to even say. I just want to eat dirt. Clay, really. It sounds awful, I know, but it helps, a little. It’s not like I’m choosing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating to be dealing with this tiredness, and it’s perfectly alright to share what’s going on, even if it feels a little unusual. It takes courage to be open about things like this. Let’s talk about the tiredness first. Could you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's…exhausting. Like I’m dragging myself through mud. Even after a full night’s sleep – and I do get a full night's sleep, unlike some people – I feel like I haven’t rested at all. I have no energy. Simple things…walking to the mailbox, making a sandwich…it wipes me out. It’s been going on for months, maybe six or seven. Honestly, I've just been trying to push through it.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven months of persistent fatigue, even with adequate sleep. That’s definitely something we need to investigate. And you mentioned it takes significant effort to do everyday tasks. Has this fatigue been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It didn’t just happen overnight. It started slowly…just feeling a little more tired than usual. Then it was needing an extra cup of coffee. Then another. Now…well, now it’s this. And the dirt-eating. Which, frankly, I’m surprised you’re not more…concerned about. It’s not exactly normal, is it?
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out – the dirt-eating, or what we call pica, is unusual and definitely something we need to understand better. It can be a sign of a nutritional deficiency, but we’ll need to explore other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? What do you think this is, a cooking show? I eat. I eat sensible things. I make my own meals, mostly. Chicken, vegetables, rice...the usual. I don’t eat a lot of junk food. I don't have time for all that nonsense. I haven't been eating much red meat lately. Too expensive. Does that matter? I don't know why you need to know all this.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I apologize if it feels like I'm asking a lot of questions. We're trying to rule out any potential causes for both the fatigue and the pica. Red meat is a good source of iron, and iron deficiency can certainly cause both of these symptoms. Okay, so mostly chicken, vegetables, and rice, with less red meat recently. Do you take any vitamin supplements at all?
PATIENT: Supplements? Goodness no. I don’t believe in all that stuff. It’s just a waste of money, lining the pockets of…well, whoever makes them. Real food is what matters. My mother always said, “Eat a good, balanced diet and you'll be fine.” And I do eat a good diet. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s good that you prioritize a healthy diet. However, sometimes even with a good diet, we can develop deficiencies, and supplements can help address those. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I had the flu, once, when I was a child. And I broke my wrist, years ago. Nothing serious. I don’t go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. I don’t believe in running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. It’s all a racket, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I take care of myself. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just going to keep asking questions forever? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the delay, Ms. Hardenburgh. I want to be thorough and understand what's going on so we can find a solution. Let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my mother lived to be 95. Healthy as a horse, she was. My father…he had high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt, on my husband’s side…she had something with her stomach, a long time ago. Honestly, I don't keep track of all that family medical nonsense. People get sick, it’s just…life.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother was healthy, your father had high blood pressure, and your aunt had a stomach problem. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What is this, a magazine interview? I live alone. I keep a tidy house. I walk to the store when I need to. I watch a bit of television. I don’t smoke. I drink a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. I mostly just try to keep busy and stay out of trouble. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. Understanding your lifestyle helps us get a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything. Well, mostly anything. I don’t care for beets. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. Look, are we going to do something about this tiredness and…this craving, or not? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. Let's proceed with a physical exam. I'd like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. I also want to take a look at your hands and nails. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But don’t expect any miracles. I’ve got better things to do than spend all day in a doctor’s office. And be gentle, I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, but within a normal range. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let me just take a quick look at your hands. Your nails are a bit pale, and your skin seems a little dry. And I notice the paleness of your nailbeds. Do you typically experience this?
PATIENT: Pale? Well, I suppose so. I haven't really noticed. I keep busy, don’t spend a lot of time looking at my hands. Always have. Probably just a sign of getting older. What does it even mean, anyway? Is this about the dirt thing? Because I’m telling you, I’m not crazy.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t mean you’re crazy, Ms. Hardenburgh. Not at all. Paleness can be a sign of several things, including anemia, which is a low red blood cell count. We need to investigate that further. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination appears good. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, I think it's important to order some blood tests. This will help us determine if you have any underlying deficiencies or medical conditions causing your fatigue and pica. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to come back if it involves poking me a million times. And I want the results quickly. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll order the tests now, and we'll try to get the results back as quickly as possible. It usually takes a few days, but I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. We’ll need to check your complete blood count, iron levels, and a few other things just to rule out anything serious. In the meantime, I wouldn't recommend eating any more dirt or clay. While it may seem to provide temporary relief, it could be harmful. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Harmful? Well, I haven't keeled over yet, have I? Look, I’ve been doing this for a while. I know what I can handle. I don’t need a doctor telling me what’s good for me. But, fine. One question. How long is “a few days”? Because if it's longer than three, I'm not bothering with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. “A few days” generally means three to five business days, but I’ll ask the lab to prioritize your tests and have the results sent to me as soon as they are available. I can also have the nurse contact you if there are any delays. I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously and will do everything we can to find out what's causing your symptoms and get you feeling better. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just get the tests done and call me when you have something. Don’t bother me until then. And try to be quick about it, alright? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll make sure the tests are prioritized. The nurse will contact you as soon as the results are available. Thank you for coming in today. .
