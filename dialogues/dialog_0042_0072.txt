DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… my memory. It's just not what it used to be, and it's starting to worry me a little. I forget things… important things, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory concerns are certainly something we want to take seriously. "Not what it used to be" is a good way to describe it – can you give me some examples of what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just last week, I had a dental appointment scheduled with another dentist – a check-up – and completely forgot about it! I only remembered when they called to confirm, and of course, I'd missed it. And… oh, this is embarrassing… I sometimes walk into a room and forget why I went in there. It's like my brain just… blanks. Little things, mostly, but it’s happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: That sounds frustrating, Ms. Heidenthal, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Missing appointments and those momentary lapses in recall… those are definitely things we should explore. To get a better understanding, could you tell me roughly when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that’s a good question. It's hard to pinpoint exactly. I think… maybe six months ago? It started with just occasionally misplacing things – keys, glasses, that sort of thing. I just figured I was getting more stressed with work. But then it started being more than just where things were… it was forgetting what I was doing, or what I was talking about mid-sentence. That's when I started to get worried. It feels like it's been getting worse lately, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, starting with misplacing things and progressing to more significant memory lapses… and you feel it’s been worsening recently. That’s helpful information. Now, are these memory issues impacting your daily life – things like work, hobbies, or social activities?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. At work, I'm a dentist, right? And I sometimes… struggle to remember details about patients' charts, or what I told them during appointments. I haven't messed anything up yet, thankfully, but I'm constantly double-checking everything, and it's exhausting. And with hobbies… I used to love gardening, but I forget which plants I’ve already watered, or what I need to buy. Little things, but it’s taking the fun out of it. I've also been avoiding social situations a bit because I'm afraid I'll forget someone's name or what we were talking about. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be very stressful, Ms. Heidenthal. It's good you’re recognizing the impact it’s having on your life, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about it. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered fully. And I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. No major surgeries or anything. Oh! And I had a really bad concussion when I was a teenager – playing volleyball – but that was a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely matters, Ms. Heidenthal. A history of concussion, even a long time ago, can sometimes be a contributing factor to memory issues. High blood pressure is also important to note, as uncontrolled hypertension can affect cognitive function. You mentioned medication for your blood pressure – can you tell me what you're taking, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Sure. It's Lisinopril, I think. 20 milligrams, once a day. I've been taking it for about five years now, and my blood pressure is usually pretty well controlled. My family doctor monitors it regularly. I had a check-up just last month, and he said everything looked good. I can get you the exact details from his office if you need them. I don’t remember the specific numbers off the top of my head.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And it's good to hear your blood pressure is generally well-controlled. To get a more complete picture, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mother had some memory problems when she got older, but we just chalked it up to aging. She didn’t get any official diagnosis or anything. My father was perfectly sharp until the very end. And my brother… he's healthy as a horse, no issues that I know of. No one in my family has ever been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or dementia, if that’s what you're asking. It was just… normal age-related forgetfulness with my mom, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific history of Alzheimer’s or dementia in the family, just some age-related forgetfulness with your mother. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. I try to eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise when I can, but it’s hard with work. I try to walk at least three times a week. It’s not always easy to fit it in, but I know I need to.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you prioritize your health. Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, that gives me a good starting point. Now, before we proceed, I want to ask about any allergies you may have to medications, food, or anything else. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And… let me think. Just a daily multivitamin. And sometimes I take fish oil, for my heart. But that’s it. Nothing else. I try to keep it pretty simple. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, just a multivitamin and occasional fish oil. Ms. Heidenthal, I think it’s important to do a brief physical and neurological exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to figure this out, so please, do whatever you need to do. I’m a little nervous, but I trust your judgment. What does the exam involve?
DOCTOR: That's very good of you, Ms. Heidenthal. The exam is quite straightforward. I'll be checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll do a basic neurological assessment. This involves checking your reflexes, balance, coordination, and some simple memory and cognitive tests – things like recalling a few words, naming objects, and following simple instructions. It’s not painful or invasive, just a way to assess how your brain is functioning. We'll also quickly look in your ears, nose and throat, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. A little nerve-wracking, but fine. I understand you need to do what you need to do. I guess… let’s get started? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here on the exam table. I'm going to wrap this cuff around your arm. Try to relax, and keep your arm still.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go…
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 132/84. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Both reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and tell me what object this is.
PATIENT: Hmm… It feels… long and cylindrical. Smooth. It’s… a pen. Is that right? I think it’s a pen.
DOCTOR: That’s correct! Very good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Remember them, because I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Got it. I think I can remember those. It’s a little tricky, but I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a simple question. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… um… let me think… it’s… 2025, right? August 2nd, 2025. I think it’s 2025. Is that right? I'm a little flustered.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Now, can you tell me what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Oh… breakfast. Um… That's a good question. I had… toast. Yes, toast with… jam. Strawberry jam, I think. And coffee. Black coffee. I usually have coffee. It's just... it's hard to remember details sometimes. I feel like I'm searching for something that’s right on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as ten minutes past eleven. I’ll give you a piece of paper and a pen. Don’t worry about making it perfect, just do your best.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A clock… showing ten minutes past eleven. Right. This is harder than it looks…
DOCTOR: There. That’s the best I can do. I’m not very good at drawing… and I think I may have gotten the hands wrong. It's a little wonky, to be honest.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s very helpful. Now, let's go back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you recall them for me?
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Um… Apple… I remember apple. And… table! Yes, table. But… The third word… it’s right on the tip of my tongue… I can’t seem to pull it out. It's frustrating. I know I heard it, but I just can't remember it. It's like it vanished. I’m so sorry. It was… penny? No… I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Don't apologize. This isn't a test, it’s just information to help me understand what’s going on. Based on your responses and the brief exam, you are experiencing some difficulties with recent memory and recall. It's not enough to make a definitive diagnosis at this point, but it does warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Oh… Further investigation… that sounds scary. What kind of investigation? Are you thinking… something serious? Is it Alzheimer’s? My mother… she didn’t want to know. What do you recommend? I’m just… worried, to be honest. And a little confused.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Heidenthal, and it's perfectly normal to feel worried. Let's take things one step at a time. The good news is that memory loss can have many different causes, and it's not always Alzheimer's disease. It could be due to stress, vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or other underlying medical conditions. To determine the cause, I recommend a few tests. First, I'd like to order some blood work to check for vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other potential imbalances. We'll also want to get a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Additionally, I recommend a structural brain scan – either an MRI or a CT scan – to rule out any physical abnormalities. And finally, I’d like you to complete a more detailed neuropsychological assessment with a specialist. This will give us a better understanding of your cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… like a lot. But yes, I guess so. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes. I want to know. A brain scan… that sounds a little scary, though. Will it hurt? And the neuropsychological assessment… what does that involve? I’m just trying to prepare myself. I’m not good with tests, to be honest. And I’m worried about the cost. Will my insurance cover all of this?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Heidenthal. Let's address your concerns one by one. The brain scan – either the MRI or CT scan – is a non-invasive procedure. You'll lie on a table inside a scanner, and it uses magnetic waves or X-rays to create images of your brain. It doesn’t involve any pain, but it can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still. The neuropsychological assessment involves a series of cognitive tests that measure different aspects of your memory, attention, language, and problem-solving skills. It's a comprehensive evaluation that helps us pinpoint specific areas of difficulty. It's usually conducted by a neuropsychologist – a specialist in brain function. It’s a long process, but it isn’t painful. As for the cost, I’ll have my billing department check your insurance coverage for each test. Medicare should cover a significant portion of these tests, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles. We can discuss the potential out-of-pocket expenses before proceeding with any of the tests. I’ll also provide you with referrals to imaging centers and neuropsychologists that are in-network with Medicare. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Knowing what to expect helps. And knowing that Medicare will likely cover some of it is a relief. So, you’ll have the billing department check my coverage, and then you’ll give me referrals to the imaging center and the neuropsychologist? What’s the next step after that? Do I need to schedule the tests myself? I’m a little overwhelmed with all of this, to be honest. I wish someone could just tell me what’s wrong. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I'm happy to guide you through this process. Yes, my staff will check your Medicare coverage and provide you with referrals to in-network imaging centers and neuropsychologists. They will also assist you with scheduling the tests, if you’d like. You can call the office at any time if you have questions or need assistance. Once we have the results of the blood work, brain scan, and neuropsychological assessment, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. That plan could include medication, lifestyle changes, cognitive therapy, or other interventions, depending on the diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and staying mentally active. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help maintain your cognitive function. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little less anxious, knowing what to expect. I’ll wait to hear from the office about the referrals and insurance coverage. And I’ll try to stay positive and take care of myself. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It was my pleasure. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
