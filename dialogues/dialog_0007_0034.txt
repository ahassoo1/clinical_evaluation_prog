DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's good to meet you too, Doctor Hernandez. I… well, I just moved here. I think this is, like, a check-up thing? My husband said I needed to find a doctor when we got here, 'cause of… the healthcare stuff. I don't really remember all the details. It's all kinda new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A welcome-to-the-area check-up is a great idea! It is good to get established with a primary care doctor when you move. And healthcare can be confusing, no worries at all. I see you’re 21, and your husband suggested this visit. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little about why he thought it was important to get you checked out?
PATIENT: Oh, um… he just said it was important for, like, making sure everything’s okay. He worries a lot. I think it had something to do with… the insurance? And maybe… making sure I don’t get sick? I don’t really know. I… I don’t remember much about why, exactly. Sorry. He handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all! It’s very common for one person to manage the healthcare details. Let's just focus on you right now. Okay. To start, are you having any specific symptoms or anything bothering you right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I mean, I feel okay. A little tired sometimes, but… I always feel a little tired. I work with machines all day, it's kinda hard work. Nothing… wrong, wrong. Just… normal tired, I guess? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Working with machines all day is physically demanding. Okay. And when you say “tired,” is it just feeling generally run-down, or is it more like you're struggling to stay awake during the day?
PATIENT: Um… more like… just feeling like I could take a nap anytime, really. Not like I fall asleep or anything. Just… not much energy, I guess? I can still do my work, but I’m usually pretty worn out by the end of the day. Sometimes I just sit on the couch and… do nothing. Not in a sad way, just… tired. Is that… helpful? I don't know if I'm explaining it right.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue, and we can definitely explore that. That’s good information. Now, let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so? I mean, I went to the doctor when I was a kid, but nothing… serious? I don’t really remember. I think I had… chickenpox? But that was a long time ago. My husband might know better, he always remembers stuff like that. I’m really sorry, I’m not very helpful with this.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, don’t worry about it at all. It's perfectly fine if you don’t recall everything. We’ll get through this. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had anything like that. I've bumped my head a few times working with the machines, but nothing that needed a hospital or anything. Just… bruises. I think. My husband might remember if I ever had stitches or something, but… I really don’t think so. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize! Okay, so no surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had… something with her heart, I think? My mom always said it was a weak heart. And my uncle… he had diabetes, I think? But I don't really know much about it. They lived far away, and we didn’t see them very often. My husband might know more details if you need to know. He’s good with remembering family history.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Heart condition in your grandmother and diabetes in your uncle. We’ll make a note of that. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? I eat pretty much anything. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. My husband always asks when he gets me food, and I always say no. But… I guess I could be allergic to something and not know? I really don’t think so, though. He'd probably remember if I ever had a bad reaction.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything. Not even vitamins. I just… get tired, like I said. But I don’t take anything for it. My husband said I should eat more vegetables, but… I haven’t really gotten around to it. He’s always trying to get me to be healthier. But no pills or anything. Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications, vitamins, or supplements. That’s good information. Alright, Emileigh, it sounds like you're generally feeling okay, but experiencing some fatigue. We’ve talked about your medical history, family history, allergies, and medications. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… don't poke me too hard? I bruise easily, my husband always says. But yeah, go ahead. I’m ready, I guess.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs first. It won’t take long. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or anything concerning. Lungs sound clear as well. Blood pressure is 118 over 72 – that’s within a normal range. Throat looks clear, and your ears look healthy. No signs of infection. Everything looks good so far. Just to be thorough, considering your fatigue, I’d like to order a basic blood panel – just to check your iron levels, vitamin D, and thyroid function. That can help rule out some common causes of tiredness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. If it helps figure out why I’m tired, then yeah, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. My husband will be happy I’m getting it checked out. He worries a lot. So, blood test, right? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, a simple blood test. It will be a quick prick on your arm, just a little pinch. Most people don’t find it very painful, but let the nurse know if you’re nervous, and they can use a numbing cream. The lab is just down the hall. They'll call out your name when they’re ready. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan to address your fatigue. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A little pinch, right? Okay, I can handle a little pinch. And then a follow-up appointment. Okay. Thank you, Doctor Hernandez. You’ve been really helpful. Even if I don’t remember everything, you’ve been really patient with me. My husband is gonna be so relieved. Should I just… go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. And you’ve been a great patient! Don’t worry about not remembering everything – that’s perfectly alright. Yes, you can head to the lab now. Just tell them you’re here for the blood work Dr. Hernandez ordered. They’ll take good care of you. If you experience any unusual symptoms between now and your follow-up appointment – like fever, severe weakness, or shortness of breath – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, we’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything really well. I’ll just… go to the lab. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. And… tell the nurse I bruise easily? Just in case. Okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. And yes, definitely mention to the nurse that you bruise easily – that’s a good idea. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon. .
