DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I think... the lady on the phone said something about talking? About... stuff? I work with metal, you know. Sheets of it. Not really sick, I don't think. Just... here 'cause someone told me to come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like someone suggested a check-up. That's perfectly alright. Even if you’re not feeling “sick”, it's good to get things checked out. You mentioned working with metal sheets—is that a new job, or have you been doing that for a while?
PATIENT: Oh. A while. Long time. My husband, he says I worry too much about things. But metal... it can be dangerous, right? Sharp edges... and all. I don't remember why I'm here exactly, just that it's about... being careful? Is that it? Do you... fix hands? My hands get tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: It is good to be careful, especially with a job that carries potential risks like working with metal. Sharp edges, repetitive motions... those can certainly cause problems. And yes, I do see patients for hand issues, among other things. It sounds like the concern is fatigue in your hands. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Tired. Like... when you use them all day. Like squeezing. And sometimes... a little ache. Not always, though. Depends. On the metal, I guess. Thin metal is easier. Thick metal... much harder. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like a bad pain, just... worn out. Like an old shoe. And my husband says I hold things too tight. He always says I need to relax more. He's probably right.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Different types of metal would definitely require different levels of force. And your husband’s observation about holding things tightly is helpful information too. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, Airam Fontanazza, age 33… I see here there's no current medical history listed, and you're currently uninsured. That’s alright, we can discuss options for that later. Before we focus on your hands, just to get a broader picture, have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Let me think. I sleep okay, I guess. Not amazing, but okay. Sometimes my back is a little sore, from bending over the metal. But that's just… old age, probably. No headaches, no fever, no… what do you call it… dizzy spells? My husband says I eat too much salt. And sometimes my fingers feel… tingly? But only when I'm really tired. And only the little finger on my right hand. It's probably nothing. Really. Just tired. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better understanding. Sleeping okay, some back soreness, the tingling in your right little finger when tired… those are all things we should consider. It's good you mentioned the tingling. While it might be nothing, it could be related to the hand fatigue, and we want to rule out anything concerning. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your hands, your range of motion, and your reflexes. Then we can talk about possible causes and a plan to help you feel better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. If you have to. But I told you, it's just tired hands. My husband always says I overthink things… I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work later. Sheets aren't going to cut themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll be as efficient as possible. It shouldn’t take long, and it's better to be thorough. Just tell me if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll be right over to take a look. Let's start with your hands. Could you extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Like this? They look… rough, don't they? All the metal. My husband says I should use lotion. He's probably right. Everything he says, he's probably right. Is something wrong? They look okay to me. Just… working hands.
DOCTOR: I'm seeing some calluses, which is very common with your line of work, and a little bit of redness on your knuckles. Your grip strength seems… adequate, but a little weaker on your right hand. And I notice some slight stiffness in your fingers when you try to bend them. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. A little. Not bad. Just… sensitive. I probably slept on it wrong. Sometimes I just… push myself too hard. My husband says I need to slow down. He’s always saying that. And… what are you looking for, exactly? Is something seriously wrong? I really need to get back to work. Those sheets... they won't bend themselves. It’s a busy season.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. The tenderness is a little concerning, especially combined with the fatigue and tingling. It could be something like carpal tunnel syndrome, or tendinitis, but we need more information to be sure. It's also possible it's simply overuse, but we want to rule out anything more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some nerve conduction studies. It’s a painless test that will help us see how the nerves in your hands are functioning. And an X-ray to rule out any underlying bone issues. Would you be able to schedule those?
PATIENT: Nerve… what? And an X-ray? Is that… expensive? My husband… he handles the money. I don't really know about these things. And I really don't have time for tests. Those sheets are waiting. I just need something for the pain, maybe? Like a cream? He says I should use more lotion, but it doesn't really help. And what about the tingling? Is that bad? Is something… broken?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns about the time and cost. Let me explain. The nerve conduction study is a non-invasive test – it doesn’t involve any needles or surgery. It just measures the electrical signals in your nerves. It's the best way to determine if there's any nerve compression, which could be causing the tingling and pain. The X-ray will just give us a picture of the bones in your hands to rule out any arthritis or other bone issues. As for cost, I can write a referral to a facility that offers financial assistance, and we can discuss payment options. Regarding the tingling, it’s not necessarily a sign of something broken, but it's a symptom we need to investigate. It could be related to the nerve compression, or something else entirely. For the pain, I can prescribe a topical cream – a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory – to help with the inflammation. However, it won’t address the underlying cause. I strongly recommend scheduling the nerve conduction study and X-ray to get a definitive diagnosis. It will give us the information we need to create the best treatment plan for you. In the meantime, the topical cream should help manage the pain, and I recommend resting your hands as much as possible. What do you think?
PATIENT: Resting… that’s… difficult. Those sheets… and my husband… he's probably right. I should just get the tests. But can it wait? Just until after the busy season? I really don't want to fall behind. And I don’t want to worry him. He gets so stressed. And the cream… is it expensive? He always says… oh, never mind. Just… write the prescriptions. And the referral. But… can you make sure it's a place that won't take too long? And… is the nerve thing… painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can schedule the tests for after the busy season, but I do recommend doing them sooner rather than later to avoid any further complications. I'll write a referral to a facility known for its efficient service and I’ll make a note on the referral request that you prefer a facility that minimizes wait times. The nerve conduction study is not painful, although it might be slightly uncomfortable. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin and sending a mild electrical current through your nerves. It's a quick procedure and most patients tolerate it well. I’m prescribing a topical cream called diclofenac, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. It should help reduce the pain and inflammation. I’m also writing a referral for a nerve conduction study and X-ray. The facility will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here are your prescriptions and referral request. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I also want to remind you to listen to your body and rest your hands as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Thank you. I guess. My husband will be happy I’m getting it checked out. He always says I worry too much. And… I hope it doesn’t take too long. Those sheets… they really won’t cut themselves.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Airam. I hope everything goes smoothly, and please remember to prioritize your health. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact us. Have a good day, and best of luck with everything.
