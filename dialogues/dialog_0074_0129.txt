DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven't got all day. It's my stool. It's…dark. Black, really. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking 'em for years. I figured it might be that, but my daughter said I should come get it checked. She worries too much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard. It's good that you came in, and it’s wise of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out. Dark stools can have a number of causes, and we want to determine what’s going on. So, you mentioned the dark stools and your arthritis medication. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the change in your stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When…let me think. It wasn’t sudden, you know? Not like bam one day black. More…gradual. Probably…oh, a couple of weeks now? Maybe three? It’s hard to say, I don’t exactly stare at my stool, if you catch my drift. And honestly, I haven't been eating much red meat lately, so it’s not that. I’m a sensible woman, I know what’s normal and what isn’t, and this isn’t normal.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Hatchard. You don’t need to be overly descriptive. A couple of weeks or so is helpful. And it’s good you’ve noticed a change from your usual. Besides the color, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Well…they’re…regular enough. I take a little something to keep things moving, you know. Can't have things stuck. But…they’re not as…firm as they used to be, I suppose. A bit…mushy, sometimes. And I’ve been a little tired lately, but that could be the weather. It's been awfully humid. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit softer than usual and some fatigue. Thank you for sharing that. We’re getting a good picture here. And no, I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Now, just to get a complete understanding, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Blood? No, definitely no blood. I would know if there was blood. And pain? Not really pain. A little cramping sometimes, but that's probably just gas. I eat cabbage, you know. Good for you, but…well, you know. Just a little discomfort, nothing major. Honestly, I've had worse with a bad cup of coffee. Can we just get this sorted? I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get this sorted quickly, Ms. Hatchard, and we will do our best. No blood, just some cramping – that’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis, and are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the red pills for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, lord. Where do I even begin? Arthritis, of course. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in…oh, '87, I think it was. Dr. Henderson did it. Good man, but retired now. As for pills…let me think. The red ones, for the arthritis, like I said. And I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. Can't remember the name, my daughter handles all that. And…sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take something for that too. Just a half a tablet, usually. Honestly, I'm not very good with names. I leave that to the professionals. Can we skip this part? It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll try to keep it brief. Arthritis, gallbladder removal in 1987, a blood pressure medication, and something for sleep occasionally. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the names, Ms. Hatchard. We can look those up in our system. And just a couple more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've never had an allergy in my life. I eat everything. Well, not snails. I don't care for snails. But other than that, I eat everything. No, no allergies. I'm a very robust woman. Honestly, I think I’m wasting my time here. Is this going to involve poking and prodding? Because I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Hatchard. No known allergies. And yes, to answer your question, a brief physical examination would be helpful, just to listen to your abdomen and check a few things. It won’t be extensive, I promise. It will just help me get a better picture of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Fine. But make it quick. I really do have that luncheon. And be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be. And don't expect me to be doing any contortions. I'm not a gymnast, you know. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as gentle as possible. No contortions necessary, I assure you. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen. No masses or rebound tenderness noted. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit diminished. Heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits. Now, could you please let me check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh, honestly. Are you sure this is necessary? I thought you said you’d be quick. It's like you're deliberately trying to take up my time. Fine, do your reflexes. But don't expect miracles. I haven't had my reflexes checked since…well, probably since I was a child. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like it's taking a bit long, Ms. Hatchard. I just want to be thorough. Checking your reflexes is a quick part of the exam, and it can give us some helpful information. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Based on what you've told me, and the brief examination, the dark stools, combined with the tenderness and diminished bowel sounds, could be a sign of several things. It could be a side effect of your arthritis medication, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as internal bleeding. To do that, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a stool occult blood test. These tests will help us determine if there is any blood in your stool, and if your blood count is normal. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests! Honestly, this is ridiculous. I knew I should have just ignored it. Complete blood count...stool tests...it’s all so unnecessary. But...my daughter would be furious if I didn't get it checked properly. Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a quick turnaround. And I want the results explained to me in plain English, not doctor-speak. And can I at least get a glass of water afterwards? This whole ordeal is rather drying. And tell me how much this is going to cost. I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. I assure you, these tests are standard procedure, and we'll do our best to get them done quickly. We'll explain the results in plain English, and I'll make sure you understand everything clearly. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away. As for the cost, let me check with the billing department. Medicare should cover most of these tests, but I can give you a breakdown of any potential out-of-pocket expenses once I have the information. In the meantime, let's get the lab orders in. The nurse will explain the process, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s enough for now. Just…get it over with. I really must be going. My luncheon is starting soon, and I’m the hostess. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather disruptive. And please, tell your nurse to be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be. And don’t forget the water. Thank you. Or, well, not thank you, exactly, but…I appreciate you trying, I suppose. Just get it done quickly, that’s all I ask. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I will personally let the nurse know to be careful with your veins. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a stool sample. If you experience any discomfort, please don't hesitate to let her know. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Hatchard. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
