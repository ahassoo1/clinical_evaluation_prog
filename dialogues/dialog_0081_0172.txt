DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I'm here. My husband insisted. Something about… a check-up? I just moved here, you see, and he wants me to establish care. It’s all very… unnecessary, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I see. Well, while I appreciate your… directness, Ms. Engelhaupt, establishing care is a prudent measure, even in the absence of specific complaints. It allows us to monitor your baseline health and catch any potential issues early on. Regardless, we can certainly proceed with a basic examination. Let's start with a little history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly before this move?
PATIENT: Regularly? Heavens no. Doctors are for when one is ill, not for… poking and prodding a perfectly healthy person. I had a physician back in… oh, goodness, what was it called? Somewhere in the city. A very long time ago. It was… adequate. I can’t recall the name, though. And truthfully, I don't remember much of what they did. It was all rather routine, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s focus on the present then. Have you experienced any changes in your health recently – say, in the past six months?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… I've gotten older, naturally. That’s a change, isn’t it? Beyond that… no, I suppose not. My knees ache a bit when the weather is damp, but that’s to be expected. And I seem to tire more easily, but that’s just… getting on in years. Really, Doctor, I assure you, I'm quite robust for my age.
DOCTOR: And you've not noticed any new symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I haven't been ill. I eat reasonably well, I sleep… mostly… and I keep myself occupied. Though, now that I think of it, I have been a little… forgetful lately. But that’s hardly a symptom, is it? It’s just… things slip one’s mind. Perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness… can you elaborate on that, Ms. Engelhaupt?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s nothing significant, Doctor. Just… names. Faces. Where I put my spectacles. Things of that nature. It’s not as if I’m wandering off and forgetting entire days! My husband gets exasperated when I ask him the same question twice, but… well, men are easily flustered. It's more his problem than mine, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking about… personal matters. Really, Doctor. Is this necessary? Very well. My appetite is… normal. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but I haven’t gained or lost anything noticeable. And… well, let's just say everything is… regular. Truly, I’m perfectly healthy. This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t believe in filling my body with all sorts of… potions and pills. My husband tries to get me to take something for my… joints, he calls them, but I refuse. I prefer a good cup of tea and a bit of common sense. No, Doctor, I take nothing. Absolutely nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens no. I've eaten everything and gone everywhere. I'm a remarkably resilient woman. Dust bothers me a bit, I suppose, but that’s hardly an allergy. No, Doctor, I’m not allergic to anything. Honestly, I find all these questions rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Very well. Then, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a basic neurological assessment. It's standard procedure for establishing care. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Honestly, I detest being touched by strangers. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. And please, don’t poke too hard. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a seat on the examination table. I’ll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs detected. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Gait is steady, but slightly slow. All right, Ms. Engelhaupt. That concludes the physical exam. I'd like to order a basic blood panel, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. Also, a urinalysis.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All of that? For what, precisely? Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. But… if you insist. Just… please send the results to my husband. He worries terribly. And please, no unnecessary poking or prodding. I’m a very delicate woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. The blood work and urinalysis will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health and help rule out any underlying issues. We'll send the results to your husband, as you requested. While the results are pending, I recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or changes in vision – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Heavens no. I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time here already. Just… send the results and let me get on with my life. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see what all the fuss is about. I'm perfectly healthy. Perfectly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. As you wish. The results will be sent to your husband within five to seven business days. It was… a pleasure meeting you.
