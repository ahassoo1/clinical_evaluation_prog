DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having a lot of pressure on my bladder lately, and it’s…well, it’s quite bothersome. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: "A little while." That is…unhelpful, Ms. Creagh. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies, Doctor. You are right to ask for more detail. Let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. Perhaps the tenth of June? It wasn’t constant at first, just occasional discomfort, but it’s become much more frequent over the last month or so. I can recall the exact date because my cousin visited then, and I noticed it a little bit while we were out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And describe this “pressure,” Ms. Creagh. Is it painful?
PATIENT: It’s not exactly painful, Doctor. More… a feeling of fullness, even when I haven’t had much to drink. And a sort of… urge to go, constantly. It’s uncomfortable, and it interrupts things, you know? It’s just…present. It doesn’t radiate or anything, it’s just there, in my bladder area. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Constantly” is another vague term, Ms. Creagh. How many times, approximately, are you needing to urinate in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… normally, I would say about five or six times a day, perhaps. But lately? It feels like every couple of hours. It's hard to be precise, Doctor, but I'd estimate closer to ten or eleven times, maybe even more on days when I'm more active. It really varies, but it's definitely a significant increase. I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… I’ve noticed it seems a bit darker than usual, a deeper yellow. And sometimes… well, it smells a bit stronger than it normally does. I haven't seen any blood, thankfully, but the color and odor have been different. I didn’t think much of it at first, assuming it was just from not drinking enough water, but it hasn't improved.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever or chills at all. And no pain in my back or sides. Just the pressure, as we’ve discussed. I haven't felt sick in any other way, really. It's just this…persistent discomfort. I have been feeling a little more tired lately, but I attributed that to work being busy. It's hard to say if that's related or not.
DOCTOR: And are you sexually active, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am married, and we are. Is that relevant to the…pressure I’ve been experiencing? I understand it may be a necessary question, but I wasn’t sure if it would be related.
DOCTOR: It is always relevant, Ms. Creagh. Now, let us move on. Any previous medical problems?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I also had my appendix removed when I was sixteen, but that was… quite a long time ago. Otherwise, I’ve generally been quite healthy. I have Medicare, so I’m sure all of that is in the system. Do you need me to list the medication I’m taking for the blood pressure?
DOCTOR: We will review your medication list electronically. Now, family history. Any history of kidney problems, bladder cancer, or similar issues in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had some issues with frequent urinary tract infections when she was older, but I don't believe it was anything more serious. And my uncle, my mother’s brother, was diagnosed with kidney stones about ten years ago. Other than that, I’m not aware of any specific history of kidney or bladder problems in my family. I believe my parents would have mentioned it if there was something significant.
DOCTOR: And finally, social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but I don’t drink heavily. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I work as a graphic designer, so I try to stay healthy and focused. I find that a clear mind is essential for my work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us perform a brief examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with an abdominal exam.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything specific you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No significant tenderness to palpation. Bladder is palpable, but not markedly distended. Bowel sounds are normal. No shifting dullness. Everything seems… unremarkable. Now, we need a urinalysis. The nurse will collect a sample. We will also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I will see the nurse then, and provide a sample. Please let me know if you need anything further from me at this time. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me.
DOCTOR: The nurse will guide you. We’ll review the results when they are available. In the meantime, I suspect this is a simple urinary tract infection, likely aggravated by dehydration. Increase your fluid intake. I will have the nurse give you a prescription for a prophylactic antibiotic, pending the urinalysis results. Do not delay urination. Now, if symptoms worsen, immediately seek emergency care. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly understood. Increase fluids, no delaying, and seek emergency care if it worsens. I will follow those instructions carefully. Thank you for your time and the prescription. I will go find the nurse now. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Just another case of…overly anxious patients. .
