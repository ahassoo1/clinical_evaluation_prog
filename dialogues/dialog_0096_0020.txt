DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is... a check-up, yes? My friend, she say I should come. I feel... okay, mostly. Just want to be sure everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: A check-up, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A general check-up. It has been... a long time since I saw a doctor. Since my husband… well, never mind that now. Is this what you do? Check if things are working?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that is what I do. Though, a “general check-up” can mean different things to different people. To be thorough, I’ll need a bit more information. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms – anything at all that’s been bothering you, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Hmm. Small things… Let me think. My back, sometimes it aches. When I bend over, you know? But I work with cars all day, so maybe it is from that. And... I get tired, but who does not get tired? I am not so young anymore. Is that what you mean? Symptoms?
DOCTOR: Back pain with bending… and fatigue. Okay. And how long have you been noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, the fatigue… maybe a few months now? It is hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. Some days I feel fine, and other days… I just want to sit. I don't have much energy to do things. I used to like gardening, but… not so much lately.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is this fatigue interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I have to stop working earlier at the garage sometimes. My friend, she helps me, but I do not want to bother her too much. I like to be independent, you know? But sometimes... I just cannot lift the heavy things, or stand for long. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's get some more information. Do you have any other medical problems—anything at all you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure, once. But the doctor, he gave me pills, and it went down. I stopped taking the pills a long time ago, though. He said it was okay. I do not remember much else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take something for my knee. It is an ointment, you rub it on. For the ache. And… I take a vitamin D pill in the winter. The sun is not strong enough then, you know? That is all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he was allergic to shellfish, but I am fine. I have never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, she had a heart problem, I think. She was sick for a long time. And my father, he had… I do not know what he had, something with his breathing. He smoked, you know? Many cigarettes. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He does not talk much about his health.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Do you want to know about my friends? I have a few good friends. We drink coffee sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Benites, not your friendships. I mean do you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any other habits I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh! I understand now. No, I do not smoke. Never have. And I drink… sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. Not very much. And… I used to dance, a long time ago. But not anymore. My knees, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I will sit here?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you could just sit up on the table, that would be great. Let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. It is a little cold.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be a bit chilly. We'll get you a blanket if you'd like. First, let's get your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly…distant. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are a bit diminished. Alright, now let's take a look at your knees. Could you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Okay. There is a little pain when I bend them. Especially this one. It feels…grindy, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's some crepitus, as you described. And a little tenderness here and here. Range of motion is slightly limited. Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. What will you do?
DOCTOR: I’m going to lightly tap on your tendons, mostly around your knees and ankles, to see how your nerves are functioning. It doesn't hurt, just a quick tap. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Ankle reflexes are also a bit diminished. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, your fatigue and elevated blood pressure are concerning. Your knees show signs of osteoarthritis, which is common at your age. We need to run some blood tests to get a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Blood tests? What are you looking for? Is it something serious? I do not like tests.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Benites, it's better to be thorough. We'll check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D. And a basic metabolic panel. It’s routine. We’re looking to rule out anything serious, like anemia, thyroid problems, or kidney issues. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but we need the information to make the best decisions about your health. And because of your fatigue and blood pressure, I also want to order an EKG—a simple heart tracing—to check for any heart abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. My husband, he always said I worry too much. If you think it is necessary, Doctor, then yes. Do what you need to do. But… will it take long? I have to get back to the garage.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take too long. The blood draw will only be a few minutes, and the EKG is quick. We’ll have the results back in a few days. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your stress and get some moderate exercise, if you’re able. And keep track of your blood pressure at home. We can discuss getting you a home monitor. Until we have the results, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose blood pressure medication. It’s just to get things under control until we know more. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Low-dose medication… alright. But I do not want anything that will make me sleepy. I need to be alert at the garage. And... what about my knees? Is there anything I can do for the pain? The ointment only helps a little.
DOCTOR: I’ll prescribe Lisinopril, a low dose. It rarely causes significant drowsiness, but we’ll monitor you closely. As for your knees, I recommend over-the-counter naproxen for pain relief. And physical therapy could be very helpful to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. I can give you a referral. Also, losing even a little bit of weight can significantly reduce the stress on your knees. Are you comfortable with these recommendations?
PATIENT: Naproxen… alright. Physical therapy… I do not know. I am not so good with exercise. Losing weight… that is always difficult. Very well, Doctor. I will try. Give me the referral, and I will think about the therapy. And the medication. Thank you. Is that all for today? I really must get back to the garage. My friend, she will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for today. The nurse will print out the prescriptions and the referral. She will also schedule your follow-up appointment and go over the results with you when they're available. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking care of your health is important. You can get dressed now, and the nurse will be right in. Have a good day, Ms. Benites.
