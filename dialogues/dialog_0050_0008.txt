DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 49 years of age. I see you have private insurance, and we are located in a rural setting. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, good morning, Doctor. Right. Forty-nine... feels like longer some days. It's my ear, you see. Feels… full. Like something's blocking it. I don’t… I can’t quite explain it. Just… plugged, I suppose. It’s been bothering me for a bit now. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don't mind. I haven’t been sleeping well because of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness in the ear, and difficulty sleeping as a result. And how long has this “fullness” been present, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Honestly? I'm not entirely sure. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and then other days… well, like today. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. Everything’s a bit… hazy lately. Sorry.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, intermittently. Very well. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No pain, not really. No dizziness, I don’t think. Sometimes my hearing feels a little muffled, especially in that ear, but I thought that was just getting older, to be honest. Nothing major, no. I wouldn't say anything else has been bothering me, specifically. I just wish this fullness would go away.
DOCTOR: No pain, no dizziness, intermittent muffled hearing. And you attribute the muffled hearing to age. I see. Now, have you experienced any ringing in either ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that you mention it… yes. Maybe. It’s not constant, not like a loud buzzing. More of a… faint hum, sometimes. It's hard to describe. It comes and goes, like everything else. I didn’t think much of it. Just assumed it was… well, you know, being my age. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s not necessarily desirable, but it's not uncommon. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, a sinus infection, perhaps?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Oh, dear. Let me see. I think I had a bit of a cold a few months back, maybe in the spring? Nothing too bad, just a sniffle and a cough. I didn't go to the doctor for it, just rested and took some… some over-the-counter stuff. Other than that… I can’t really recall anything significant. I try to stay healthy, you see. It’s just… the memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A mild cold a few months ago. I see. Now, regarding your past medical history, are you currently being treated for any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Well, my wife… she passed away last year. It was… sudden. Heart trouble. I haven’t really been myself since then, to be honest. Other than that… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. Just a bit… forgetful these days. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss is… difficult. And while forgetfulness can be a natural part of aging, we should investigate further. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago, of course. And… I think I had some work done on my knees a few years back, but it wasn't a major surgery, just some… some injections. That's about it, I believe. Nothing else comes to mind. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s pertinent information, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Just a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And… occasionally some over-the-counter pain relievers for my knees, when they act up. That’s it, I’m pretty sure. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It is… acceptable. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm… Not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Bees, maybe? I got stung as a child, but that was a long time ago. I don’t think I’m allergic, not really. Does that cover everything, Doctor? I’d really like to get this ear sorted, if possible. It’s been… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, if you would please lie down on the examination table, I’d like to take a look in your ears. We will start with an otoscopic examination.
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, of course. An examination. Lead the way, Doctor. I hope it won’t take too long. I have… things to do, you see. But I appreciate you looking into this. Let’s get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Quite right. Now, this may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. …Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen impaction in the right ear canal. And the tympanic membrane… appears slightly dull. Now, let’s examine the left ear. …The left ear appears clear. Do you feel any pain or discomfort in either ear at this moment?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a… a slight pressure, maybe, when you put that thing in. Nothing major. It feels… a bit blocked, still. Is that the blockage you were talking about? The… cerumen? Is it serious, Doctor? It’s just… I rely on my hearing, you see. For work, and… well, everything.
DOCTOR: The cerumen impaction is common, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, and not inherently serious. However, it can contribute to your symptoms. The dullness of the tympanic membrane is… concerning, and warrants further investigation. It could indicate a middle ear effusion, though without further testing, it’s difficult to say for certain. I recommend we perform a tympanometry test to assess the function of your middle ear. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A tympanometry test… A what now? Is that… painful? Will it take long? I’m not good with… procedures, you see. I prefer things simple, if you don’t mind. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe just… remove the wax? I just want this ear to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: A tympanometry test is very simple, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It involves placing a small probe into your ear canal and measuring how your eardrum responds to changes in air pressure. It is not painful. It will take only a few minutes. Removing the wax is an option, but without knowing the underlying cause of the impaction, it may simply recur. And it won't address the dullness of the tympanic membrane. I strongly advise we proceed with the tympanometry to ensure an accurate diagnosis. It is a necessary step.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A tympanometry test. If you say it’s necessary… Just… please make it quick. And be gentle. I really don’t like things in my ears. Get it over with, shall we? I have… appointments, you see. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lean back and relax. …Now, I will briefly change the air pressure. It may feel a slight tugging sensation. …Now, the left ear. …Hmm. The results are… inconclusive. The right ear demonstrates reduced compliance, consistent with the cerumen impaction, but the left ear is within normal limits. This requires further investigation. I recommend an audiometry test to assess your hearing sensitivity. It will provide more detailed information and help determine the best course of action. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Another test? An… audiometry test? What is that one? Is it going to involve putting things in my ears again? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to get quite anxious. All these tests… and I don't even know what you're looking for! Can't you just… remove the wax and see if that helps? Please? I really don't think I can handle another procedure. I have… important things to do. And I'm not getting any younger, you see. It’s all a bit much. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, I understand your anxiety, but proceeding with a thorough investigation is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. Simply removing the wax without knowing the underlying cause could be detrimental. I strongly recommend you reconsider your stance and agree to the audiometry test. If you continue to refuse further testing, I am unable to provide further treatment at this time. I can, however, provide a referral to an otolaryngologist – an ear, nose, and throat specialist – who may have alternative approaches.
