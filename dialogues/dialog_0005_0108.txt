DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, it's my stomach. Been messin' with me somethin' awful. Real awful, actually. Been throwin' up... not pretty, and there's, uh, blood in it. Not a lot, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago, just felt sick, then it got worse, quick.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, blood. Look, I ain't one for makin' things up, Doc. It's…darkish red, not bright. And it's not like a cut or somethin'. It's… mixed in with everything else, you know? I tried to ignore it, figured it was somethin' I ate, but it just keeps happenin'. And honestly? I'm gettin' kinda weak.
DOCTOR: Right. And how much have you been throwing up?
PATIENT: Well, I ain't been keepin' track exactly. I'm a crematory operator, Doc, not a scientist. But… a good amount. Enough that I'm feelin' pretty dehydrated, I reckon. I've been tryin' to sip water, but it just… comes right back up. Happened three times just this mornin', before I even bothered comin' in. And I'm tellin' ya, it ain't gettin' better.
DOCTOR: And besides the vomiting and the blood, anything else?
PATIENT: Yeah, now that you mention it… my stomach's been crampin' up something fierce. Real sharp pains. And I haven't been able to... well, go to the bathroom normally for a couple days now. Just… nothin'. Feels kinda blocked up, if you know what I mean. And I'm tired. Real tired. Just feelin' generally lousy, Doc. Like somethin’s really wrong. Not just a bad stomach bug.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had a fever, nausea, or chills?
PATIENT: Nausea? Sure, Doc. Constant nausea. That’s why I said I’ve been throwin’ up, remember? As for fever… I dunno. Haven't bothered checkin'. I ain't one for thermometers. And chills? Not really. Just… kinda cold and clammy sometimes, but that could be from bein' sick, right? I'm tellin' ya, Doc, this feels different than anything I've had before. It's… persistent. And it’s makin’ me worried. A man's gotta work, ya know? Gotta keep things movin'. This is throwin' a wrench in things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Well, not much to tell ya, honestly. I've always been a pretty healthy guy. Don't drink, don't smoke. I had my appendix taken out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, just the usual bumps and bruises. I was married for a long time, but my wife passed away a few years back. Been mostly keepin' to myself since then. I ain't been to a doctor in…well, I don't even remember the last time, to be honest. I generally just tough things out. I figure most things fix themselves. But this… this is different. Really different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not a one. I don’t believe in 'em. Always figured they do more harm than good, messin' with your body. I got through life just fine without 'em. Never needed pills or nothin'. Plain and simple. That's why this is so strange, Doc. I don't take nothin'. Just… work, eat, sleep. That's it. And now this. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. I'm going to need to examine you. I need to listen to your abdomen, and I'm going to need to do a quick rectal exam. It's important to rule out anything serious. Now, I understand you're not a fan of doctors or medication, but this is necessary. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hold on now. A... a what exam? Look, Doc, I came in here feelin’ sick, not lookin’ for… that. I appreciate you wantin’ to be thorough, but that seems a bit much, don’t ya think? I mean, I told ya what’s happenin’. Blood, cramps, no bathroom… isn't that enough? I'm not comfortable with that, Doc. Not at all. I reckon I'll just go home and try to ride it out. Seems like a bit of an overreaction to me. I'm a grown man, I can handle a little stomach trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, you are presenting with symptoms that could indicate a serious medical problem. Vomiting blood, abdominal pain, and inability to pass stool are not things to "ride out." A rectal exam is a standard part of assessing this type of situation. I need to check for any obstructions or other abnormalities. I understand your discomfort, but my priority is your health. If you refuse a necessary examination, I am limited in what I can do for you. Are you truly refusing a physical assessment?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't lookin' to argue, Doc. But I'm tellin' ya, you're makin' a big deal outta nothin'. I've had worse. And frankly, I don't trust doctors much to begin with. Always lookin' for somethin' to fix, even when there ain't nothin' to fix. I'm a simple man. I work hard, I eat right, and I generally keep to myself. I don't need poked and prodded. I'll just go home, drink some ginger ale, and see how it goes. If it gets worse, then maybe I’ll reconsider. But right now? I’m leavin’. You do your thing, Doc, and I’ll do mine. I ain’t stickin’ around for no… exam. It’s my body, after all.
