DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Yackey. Well, to be frank, my wife insisted. She's a bit… anxious, you see. She wants me to get checked for… that HIV thing. I don't really think it's necessary, but here I am. It's probably nothing, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. Your wife has some concerns regarding potential HIV exposure, and you're here primarily to satisfy those concerns, despite not experiencing any personal anxieties yourself. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: “Potential” is a strong word. She watches too many dramas, if you ask me. No, it’s not that I think anything happened, it’s just… she worries. A lot. It's better to just get it over with, I suppose. It’s just a waste of everyone’s time, really. But fine, let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Very well. To be thorough, we will proceed with the appropriate testing. However, it's important to understand that testing isn't simply a formality, even without perceived risk. It's a standard preventative measure. Now, have you ever been tested for HIV previously?
PATIENT: No, never. Look, I’ve been married for ten years. Same wife. No funny business, alright? It feels a bit… insulting, frankly, that you're asking. But if you have to ask, no. Never tested. And I doubt I need to now. Is this going to take long? I have a rather important call later.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, while I appreciate your assurances regarding your marital fidelity, it's my professional responsibility to gather a complete medical history. HIV testing is recommended for all adults, regardless of risk factors. It's a simple blood draw, and it will take approximately fifteen minutes to process the results. Now, regarding your past medical history – have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Look, I understand you have a job to do, but seriously? Are you implying something? I’ve lived a perfectly respectable life. No, I’ve never had anything. Not even a sniffle, if we’re being honest. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather… demeaning. I’m starting to regret coming in here. Just get it over with, alright? The quicker this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed directly to the blood draw then. Before we do, I need to document a few more details. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat everything. Spicy food, shellfish, you name it. I'm a pretty robust guy, actually. Just… get on with it. This is becoming quite a production over nothing, if you ask me. Are you sure this is even necessary? My wife… she worries about everything. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration. However, as I’ve explained, this is standard procedure. It is not based on suspicion, but on preventative care guidelines. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, occasionally. Nothing regular, honestly. My wife tries to get me to take all sorts of things, but I usually forget. She buys them, they sit in the cupboard… it’s a whole thing. No, nothing I take consistently. Really, is this all necessary for a simple check-up? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll follow me, we can get the blood draw completed. The phlebotomist is ready for you. It will only take a few minutes. And, for the record, this is not a simple check-up, Mr. Belan. It is a specific test requested due to concerns raised by your wife, and I am obligated to follow proper medical protocol. Let’s proceed.
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Honestly, the amount of fuss over this… It’s ridiculous. My wife… always worrying. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. The phlebotomist will be in momentarily. While you wait, I’ll document your refusal of a more thorough medical history. It’s important to have a complete picture, but I respect your decision, however ill-advised. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: Ill-advised? Really? Look, I don’t appreciate the condescending tone. I just don’t see the point of all this… probing. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… do it. And the quicker it’s done, the better. Is it going to hurt? I hate needles. Honestly, this whole thing is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: It will be a brief pinch, Mr. Belan. The phlebotomist is very skilled. It's far less unpleasant than you might imagine. Ah, here she is now. Nurse Sharma, this is Mr. Belan. He's here for an HIV test. I’ll be back momentarily to review the results when they are available.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with quickly. I have a very important call later. And try not to make a mess, alright? I really dislike seeing blood.
