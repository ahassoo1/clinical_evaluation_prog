DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Talen, was it? Yes, well, it’s about this…letter. For a pet, you see. My daughter, she’s moving, and they need some kind of…proof. That I’m…responsible enough to have a pet. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit silly, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Talen is correct. I understand. It does sound…unconventional, Ms. Wrye. So, to clarify, this letter is required by your daughter’s new landlord or housing association as part of the move-in process, pertaining to pet ownership?
PATIENT: Oh, housing association, yes! That’s it. Landlord sounds…small. It’s a very nice place she's moving to, very…particular. They want everything just so. Honestly, I don’t see what my medical history has to do with a fluffy little dog, but she said I needed a letter. From a doctor, no less. It’s all very…much.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying, Ms. Wrye. It is a bit unusual, but I can certainly understand wanting to accommodate their requirements. To provide a comprehensive letter, and ensure it’s appropriate, I'd like to gather some basic information. If you don’t mind, I’ll ask a few questions, just as I would during a routine check-up. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Routine check-up? Honestly. Well, alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have things to do, you know. But what does this have to do with my dog? Is there something wrong with having a pet that requires a doctor’s note? I’ve had animals my whole life.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Wrye. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything being wrong with pet ownership. It appears the housing association may be looking for confirmation of responsible decision-making and general health stability, and sometimes a physician’s assessment is requested. It’s not common, but it does happen. To start, could you please tell me about any current medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it like that... I suppose it makes a little more sense. Responsible decision-making, you say? Honestly. As for medical conditions… let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my back last year, but it's much better now. And… I get tired easily, but who doesn’t these days? It’s probably just…age. I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I’m being honest. Do I have to list everything? It feels a bit…personal.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wrye. We only need to cover anything that might be relevant to demonstrating overall well-being. "Relevant" is the key word. Back trouble last year, and fatigue… those are both helpful to know. To clarify the back pain, was that a specific injury, or more of a gradual onset?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… a bit of both, I think. I was helping my daughter move some furniture, a very heavy chest of drawers, and I felt a twinge. Then it just… stayed. I didn't bother with a doctor then, just took some ibuprofen and rested. It’s really not a problem anymore, I just… sometimes feel it after a long day. Honestly, I’m a very active person, despite what this housing association might think. I just… don’t like making a fuss. Do you need to know what kind of ibuprofen? It was the… purple one, I think.
DOCTOR: The information you’re providing is very helpful, Ms. Wrye. Knowing it was related to a specific event and responds to over-the-counter medication is useful. As for the ibuprofen, knowing it was effective is the important part, the specific brand isn't necessary. Now, aside from your back, are you currently taking any other medications – prescription or over-the-counter – on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my… blood pressure, sometimes. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago, but I don’t always remember to take it. And… vitamins. Yes, I take vitamins. A multi-vitamin, I think. And… oh, sometimes I take something for… sleep. If I can’t get to sleep, you know? But not every night. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I have a lot going on. Do you write all this down? It feels very… official.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Ms. Wrye. It’s standard practice to ensure a complete and accurate record. Knowing about the blood pressure medication, vitamins, and occasional sleep aid is all very helpful. To clarify regarding the blood pressure medication: Do you know the name of the medication, or perhaps the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… no, I don't think so. The little pills are… white, I think? Small, definitely. And I take… one? Or maybe two? It depends. My daughter handles my prescriptions mostly, she reminds me when I need a refill. Honestly, I'm terrible with names and numbers. It's a blessing and a curse, you know? I'm very good at… other things. Like decorating. And hosting parties. But medication… not my forte. Do you really need to know all of this? It feels a bit invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Wrye. I apologize if it feels invasive. It’s important for me to gather this information to provide an accurate assessment, and the housing association may request details regarding your overall health management. Since you aren’t certain of the medication name or dosage, we can document that you are currently prescribed medication for blood pressure management, as indicated by your daughter, but the specifics are unknown at this time. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, but that could be the dust. Or the pollen. Honestly, allergies aren’t something I worry about much. My daughter is the one with all the sensitivities. She can’t eat gluten, or dairy, or… something else. It’s very complicated. I just eat whatever tastes good. So, no. I don’t think I have any allergies. Unless you count a bad attitude, but that’s not medical, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wrye, a bad attitude wouldn’t be considered a medical allergy. It’s good to know you don’t have any known drug or food sensitivities. Now, to complete the basic medical history, could you briefly describe your general lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My lifestyle? What does that even mean? Well, I’m retired, so I don’t work work anymore. I keep busy, though. I love to garden, and I host a lot of parties for my friends and family. My daughter and her husband come over often, and we have a lovely time. I try to stay active, but I do enjoy my comforts, you know? A good cup of tea, a comfortable chair… Honestly, I’d say I live a very full and happy life. Is that what you wanted to know? It’s probably not very interesting for a doctor, is it? You're used to people with problems, aren’t you?
DOCTOR: It’s very helpful to know, Ms. Wrye. It’s not about problems, it’s about understanding your overall well-being and lifestyle factors. Knowing you are retired, enjoy gardening, socializing, and maintaining an active lifestyle paints a very positive picture. To round out the history, have you ever been hospitalized for any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hospitalized… Let me think. Years ago, when my daughter was little, I had my appendix out. That was… unpleasant. And… I think I was in the hospital once for a bad flu, but it was very quick. Just an overnight stay, I think. Nothing major. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person. I don’t get sick often. And I certainly haven’t been in the hospital in years. Is that enough? Can we get back to this letter now? My daughter is expecting it soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Wrye. Appendectomy and a brief hospitalization for the flu. Now, to clarify, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Honestly, it’s complicated. My mother lived to be very old, but she had… something. I can’t quite remember what. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t really pay much attention to those things. My sister is fine, as far as I know. She lives in another country and we don’t talk often. Honestly, I’m not very good at remembering those details. It’s all a bit of a blur. Is it really important? I mean, I’m the one who’s healthy, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not essential to have precise details, but knowing a general family history can sometimes be helpful. We can document a family history of longevity, with a possible history of cardiac issues. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you currently smoke, use tobacco products, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Smoking? Never. It's dreadful for your health. And alcohol… well, I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Very occasionally. It’s not something I do regularly. Honestly, I prefer a nice cup of tea. Much healthier, you know? I try to take good care of myself. I really do. Is that all? Can we finally get to this letter now? My daughter is relying on me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wrye, that completes the basic history. Based on the information you’ve provided, you have a healthy lifestyle, are generally well, with no significant medical concerns. I believe I have enough information to draft a letter stating that you are in reasonably good health and appear capable of responsibly caring for a pet. I’ll prepare that now. It may take a few minutes. Would you mind if I step out briefly to finalize it?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Yes, please do! That would be… immensely helpful. I can sit here quietly, no problem. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient with me. Honestly, I'm not very good at remembering these things. Just let me know when it’s ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I’ll be as quick as possible. Here you are, Ms. Wrye. This letter outlines your general good health and my assessment of your capacity for responsible pet ownership. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Hmm… yes, that all looks right. “Reasonably good health…” That’s… good enough, I suppose. “Capable of responsible pet ownership…” Yes, definitely. I am a responsible person! Thank you so much, Doctor! You’ve been a lifesaver. Honestly, my daughter will be so relieved. Is there anything I need to sign? Or… pay?
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Wrye. No signature is required, and the cost of this consultation will be billed to your insurance as a standard office visit. I'm glad I could assist you. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you. No, I think that’s everything. Honestly, I’m just very glad it’s over. I can finally relax now. And thank you again, Doctor Talen. You’ve been a… a real gem. Goodbye! .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Wrye. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. .
