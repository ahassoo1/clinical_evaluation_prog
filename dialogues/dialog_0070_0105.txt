DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think. For my weight. It’s… a bit complicated, honestly. I don't really remember all the details about setting it up, but my wife helped a lot with that. She said it was an evaluation?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like you're interested in discussing weight loss surgery. That's perfectly alright, and it's quite common to have questions and feel a bit overwhelmed with the initial steps. It's good your wife is supporting you. So, to clarify, this is an evaluation to see if you might be a good candidate for bariatric surgery, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Bariatric… that's the name of it, isn't it? I keep forgetting the words. And yes, my wife, Leena, she did all the paperwork and stuff. I just… showed up. She’s really good at organizing things. I appreciate it a lot. Is this evaluation going to be like a test? Or just talking? I’m not good with tests.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be a formal “test” as you might imagine. It's primarily a conversation, Mr. Kochubey. I'll be asking you a series of questions about your medical history, your current health, and your lifestyle. This helps me understand if surgery is a suitable option for you and, if so, what type might be best. We'll also discuss the risks and benefits involved. It’s perfectly fine if you don’t remember everything perfectly – that’s what I’m here for. And Leena’s support is wonderful; we can certainly clarify details as we go. Perhaps we can start with your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… less scary. Talking is good. My medical history… hmm. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much. Just when something really hurts. I think I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, maybe? Nothing serious. As an adult… I think I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while cleaning the gutters. And I had a bad infection in my foot a few years ago, but that cleared up with antibiotics. I don’t really… keep track of things like that. Does that make it hard? Should I be remembering more?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's not uncommon for people to not have a detailed medical history readily available. We'll work with what you do remember, and if there are gaps, we can focus on your current health status. You mentioned a broken wrist and a foot infection. Do you recall approximately when those occurred?
PATIENT: Um… the wrist… that was… maybe eight or nine years ago? It was summer, I think. We were getting the house ready for my daughter’s birthday. The foot infection… maybe three or four years ago? I was working in the garden, and I stepped on something sharp. It got really swollen and red. I had to take time off work. Both times I just went to the urgent care clinic down the road, if that matters. They didn’t send me to a specialist or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Urgent care visits are perfectly fine. We’ll make a note of those. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And… Leena gives me something for my heartburn every now and then. It's a little pink pill, but I don’t know the name of it. She just says it’s for indigestion. I don’t take it every day, only when I eat something spicy. Does that count? I mostly try to avoid things that give me heartburn anyway.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does count, Mr. Kochubey. It’s important to mention everything, even medications taken occasionally. Knowing about the heartburn medication is helpful. Do you happen to know the dosage of the pink pill?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. Leena handles all of that. She just tells me to take one with dinner if I had something… rich. I don’t even look at the bottle, honestly. I’m terrible with that stuff. She gets annoyed when I don’t ask. I think it has a number on it, like 20 or something, but I could be wrong. I feel bad asking her now because we’re already here, and I don't want to bother her.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. We can try to get more information later if needed. It’s not a problem at all. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's just a mild allergy. My wife has a shellfish allergy, so we don't eat that at home, but I’m not allergic myself. I think I’m pretty good, allergy-wise. I don't break out in hives or anything dramatic. Nothing like Leena. She carries an EpiPen.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug or food allergies, mild seasonal allergies perhaps. And your wife has a shellfish allergy – good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My parents… they’re both gone now. My dad had… something with his heart, I think. He got sick pretty quickly. And my mom had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself very well. She liked sweets. I don’t really know much beyond that, honestly. I didn’t talk to my family much growing up, and I don’t have any siblings. It’s just me, mostly. So, not a lot of family history to go on, unfortunately. I wish I knew more. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's not uncommon to have limited information about family history. Knowing that your father had heart issues and your mother had diabetes is helpful, even without specific details. We can proceed without a comprehensive family history. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Could you tell me a bit about your diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s not a good conversation, Doctor. I… I don’t eat very well. I work a lot of hours at the store, and it’s easy to grab fast food. Leena tries to get me to eat healthier, but it’s hard. And I don’t exercise at all. I mostly just sit at work and then sit at home. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. I’m not very active, to be honest. It’s a bad habit, I know. I try to avoid looking at the scale. It’s… depressing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Kochubey. Many people find it challenging to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and it's perfectly alright to acknowledge those difficulties. We're not here to judge, but to understand your current situation so we can determine the best course of action. Before we proceed, let's quickly discuss your smoking or alcohol consumption habits. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My parents both smoked, and it smelled terrible. I always hated it. I've never even tried a cigarette. And I don't drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But not very often. I don't really like the taste of it, to be honest. Leena will have a glass with dinner sometimes, but I stick to water. Mostly water. It's healthier, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very healthy, Mr. Kochubey. That’s good to know. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your height, weight, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. I guess. I don't really like going to the doctor, but if you have to, you have to. Just try to be quick, okay? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… try not to tell me my weight. I already know it’s not good. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I understand your hesitation about the weight, and we can focus on other vital signs if you prefer. Alright, let's start with your height and weight. Okay, your height is 5’1” and your weight is 260 pounds. Your blood pressure is 142/92, and your pulse is 88. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. I do notice some increased abdominal girth, which is common in patients considering bariatric surgery. I'm also noticing some mild swelling in your ankles. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh, yeah, a little. It comes and goes. I thought it was just from standing too long at work. It doesn’t really hurt, just… uncomfortable. Like they’re a little tight in my shoes. I usually take my shoes off as soon as I get home. It’s probably nothing. I didn’t really think it was important enough to mention. Work is hard on your feet, you know? Long hours, standing all day. It's just something I deal with. Is it bad? Should I see someone about my ankles?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned it, Mr. Kochubey. While it may be related to your job, ankle swelling can sometimes indicate underlying issues, such as fluid retention. We should investigate it further. I'm going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any other potential causes for the swelling. Based on our conversation and the preliminary exam, you potentially meet some of the criteria for bariatric surgery. However, the blood work and possibly an EKG will help us determine if you're a good candidate, and if there are any underlying health issues that need to be addressed before proceeding. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? That sounds… like a lot. I just wanted to get this surgery done. But I guess if you have to do tests, you have to do tests. I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. Just… tell me what happens next. And try to keep it simple, okay? I don’t want to get confused. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t have a lot of money, to be honest. My wife, Leena, she’s really good at dealing with insurance… if we even have coverage for all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. I understand your concerns. The blood work is a standard procedure to assess your overall health and ensure you're fit for surgery. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, checks the electrical activity of your heart. It’s a quick and painless test. As for the cost, that’s a valid concern. Bariatric surgery can be expensive, but we’ll do everything we can to help you navigate the insurance process and explore potential financial assistance options. Leena's help with the insurance will be invaluable. I'll have my staff contact your insurance provider to determine your coverage. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work and EKG scheduled. My staff will set those up for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything pretty clearly. Just… try not to scare me with too many medical terms, okay? And tell Leena to bring a list of all my medications when she comes. I always forget stuff. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. It's a lot to take in, but I'm hoping this surgery will help me feel better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m happy to help, and I will certainly do my best to avoid technical jargon. I understand it’s a lot to process, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. My staff will provide you with detailed instructions for the blood work and EKG. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Kochubey. I look forward to working with you to improve your health.
