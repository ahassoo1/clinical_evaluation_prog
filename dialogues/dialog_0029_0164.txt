DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired and yellowing… and it seems linked to fava beans. That is a bit unusual. Can you tell me more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just regular tired, you know? It’s… like all my energy is just gone. Even getting out of bed feels like a huge effort. And it doesn’t really get better with rest, not completely. It’s been going on for about a week now, maybe a little longer. It's hard to say exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this yellowing – where are you noticing it?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my eyes, I think. And my skin… it’s hard to tell for sure, but my husband noticed it first. He said I look a bit pale and… well, yellowish. It’s not bright yellow, but definitely not my normal color. I hadn’t really paid attention until he pointed it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so yellowing of the eyes and skin, and significant fatigue, and it’s connected to eating fava beans. That’s… interesting. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feeling a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I walk up the stairs. And my stomach has been a little upset, like a bit queasy, but not full-on sick. It comes and goes. I haven't had a fever or anything like that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Shortness of breath and stomach upset are good things to know. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with anything medical before?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I've been pretty healthy my whole life, honestly. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I've never had any blood transfusions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother... she had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, but other than that, not really any major illnesses that I know of. My father was healthy as a horse until he passed away. I have a brother, and he's doing fine too, as far as I know. Nobody that I'm aware of has had anything like what's happening to me. It's a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can take most things without a problem. I haven't had any reactions to any medicine before. And I don't have any food allergies either, besides maybe a slight sensitivity to dairy, but it's not a full-blown allergy, just a bit of stomach upset sometimes. It’s definitely not as bad as this though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don't really feel the need for vitamins. I might take a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that's about it. Nothing regularly. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, definitely not. I've never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I absolutely do not use any recreational drugs. I'm a pretty simple person, really. I like gardening and spending time with my husband.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your eyes and skin. Then I’ll feel your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I'm just hoping we can figure out what’s going on. It's been a little scary feeling so weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Hmm… okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your abdomen is a little tender, especially on your right side. Your skin appears slightly pale, and I do notice some mild jaundice in your sclera – the whites of your eyes. Ms. Haggar, based on your symptoms – the fatigue, the yellowing, and especially the connection to fava beans – and this tenderness, I'm concerned about a possible hemolytic anemia, potentially related to G6PD deficiency. I'm going to order some blood tests to confirm this. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, a bilirubin level, and a G6PD enzyme assay. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Hemolytic… what was it, anemia? And G6PD… deficiency? I don't even know what that is. But if you think it's important, then yes, of course, do the tests. Whatever you need to do to figure out what’s wrong. I'm a little worried now, to be honest. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Haggar. Hemolytic anemia means your red blood cells are being destroyed faster than they can be made. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition where your red blood cells don't have enough of an enzyme called G6PD, which protects them from certain things. Fava beans, certain medications, and even infections can trigger the breakdown of red blood cells in people with this deficiency. It can be serious, but it's usually manageable with treatment and avoidance of triggers. The blood tests will give us a much clearer picture. I'm putting in the orders now. They should be ready in a couple of hours, and we can review the results together. In the meantime, I want you to avoid fava beans completely, and also avoid any new medications unless you've spoken to me first. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… avoid fava beans and new medications. That makes sense, I guess. And wait for the test results. It’s just… I love fava beans. My grandmother used to make a wonderful stew with them. But I understand. What kind of treatment would I need if it is that deficiency? And are there any other things I should be avoiding? Will I need a transfusion? I’m a little scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be scared, Ms. Haggar. We’ll take things one step at a time. Treatment for G6PD deficiency usually involves avoiding triggers – like fava beans and certain medications – to prevent the breakdown of red blood cells. In some cases, if the anemia is severe, a blood transfusion might be necessary. However, that’s not usually the first step. We'll monitor your blood levels closely, and if they drop too low, then we'll consider a transfusion. As for other things to avoid, it’s best to let me know all the medications you've taken in the last few months, even over-the-counter ones, so I can check if any of them could be triggering this. There are certain infections that can also exacerbate the condition, so we'll also want to be mindful of that. I’m going to print out a list of medications to avoid while we wait for your results, and also a list of things to look out for. I’ll also give you my direct number, so you can call if you have any concerns. We’ll figure this out together, Ms. Haggar. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for your number. It helps to know I can call if I get worried. I’ll avoid the fava beans and the medications, and I’ll try not to panic. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. I'll have the nurse come in shortly with the information and schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns at all. Take care, Ms. Haggar. And again, we'll get to the bottom of this.
