DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… well, it’s… down there. Something’s… leaking. Not good leaking. It’s been a few days, maybe? I dunno. Old age, I guess. Everything starts to go, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. “Leaking,” you say. And it’s been a few days. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? It comes out. It’s… kinda slimy. And it smells funny. Not like flowers, that’s for sure. I try to keep it clean, but… it just keeps happening. It’s embarrassing, you know? I haven't… well, it's been a long time since anyone's been close enough to notice.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing to talk about, Jimmi, and I appreciate you telling me. When you say “down there,” are you referring to vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Vagi… what now? Oh, you mean… there there? No, not there. Down there. Like… a man's thing. It's my son's problem, but… he won’t come to the doctor. Said I should ask for him. He’s a good boy, but stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is happening to your son. And you're asking about it on his behalf. Is he experiencing any pain or discomfort with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? I dunno. He didn’t say anything. He just… handed me a wipe and said “Ask the doctor if this is normal.” Boys don't talk about things, you know? Especially that stuff. He just looked… worried. And kinda red in the face. He’s always been shy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, he’s experiencing discharge and seems worried, but hasn’t mentioned any pain. Has he noticed any other symptoms – like burning when he urinates, any sores, or a fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No. He's been working a lot, kinda tired, but that's normal for him. Burning… I don't know. He uses the bathroom alone, silly question, right? Look, I’m not a nurse. I just know something’s not right and he sent me to ask. He’s a builder, always getting cuts and scrapes… maybe it’s something from that?
DOCTOR: Okay, cuts and scrapes are good to know. It's possible it could be related to a skin infection. Let's take a look. Would you mind if I did a quick exam?
PATIENT: Exam? You mean… look at it? Oh dear. Well… I guess. If you have to. But be quick, alright? And gentle! I'm not as young as I used to be. And please, don't make a fuss. It's embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, Jimmi. I'll just need to take a look and maybe swab a small sample. I’ll explain everything as I go. Let’s have you lie down on the examination table, and we’ll get started. Do you have your own underwear on, or would you like to use a gown?
PATIENT: Gown? Oh, no thank you. I’m alright. Just… hurry, please. This is making me nervous. I have my own. Don't want anyone seeing… well, you know. Just get it over with, alright? And tell me what you find. Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jimmi. Just relax as much as possible. I’m going to take a look now. Okay. I see some redness and a bit of discharge, as you mentioned. It doesn't look severely inflamed, but we need to send this sample to the lab to get a better idea of what's going on. It could be a simple infection, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’ll also check his temperature and listen to his lungs just to be thorough. His temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’ll write up a lab request and we'll get that sent off. It usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain soaps, but that's it. He doesn't take any medicine, either. Just… works hard. So, 2-3 days? That's a long time to be worried. What if it’s something bad? He has a big job coming up. Can’t have him sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Jimmi. It is a wait, but it’s important to have an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. While we wait for the results, I'll recommend he practice good hygiene – keeping the area clean and dry. Avoid tight-fitting underwear and sexual activity until we know what we’re dealing with. We'll call you as soon as the results are back. If he develops a fever, severe pain, or any other concerning symptoms before we hear from the lab, please bring him in immediately or go to the emergency room. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we always want to err on the side of caution. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… tell him to be careful. He pushes himself too hard. And thank you, Doctor. For not laughing. It's… well, it's a silly thing to have to ask about. Call me as soon as you know something, alright? I’ll be waiting by the phone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. It's not silly at all to ask questions about your health or your son’s health. That’s what I’m here for. And I promise, I’ll call you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll get this figured out. Here’s my card with the clinic number, in case you need to reach me before then. Take care, and please encourage your son to rest and be mindful of his health.
