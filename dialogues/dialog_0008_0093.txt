DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, honestly, it’s… hard to say exactly. Things just aren’t right, you know? Sleep’s been off. And I feel… flabby. Not energetic. It’s probably just getting old, I guess. Though I'm not that old.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not feeling right” can be a lot of things. You’re 29, right?
PATIENT: Yep. Twenty-nine. Though it feels like a lot longer some days. Especially since… well, never mind. Look, does it matter? I just want to feel… better. More like I used to. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Let's try to figure out what’s going on. When you say “sleep’s been off,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Where to begin? It's not like I can't fall asleep, exactly. It’s more… restless. Tossing and turning. Waking up feeling like I haven't slept a wink. And when I do sleep, it’s… shallow. Like I wasn’t really there. It’s just… not restorative, you know? Does that make sense? I wouldn’t know the first thing about what proper sleep is supposed to feel like, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, restless sleep, difficulty feeling rested even after sleeping... That’s helpful. And you mentioned feeling “flabby” and lacking energy. How long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably… a while now. Months, at least. Hard to say precisely. Time kinda… blends together, if I'm being honest. It started gradually, I think. Just a little less pep, a little more… discomfort. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Fixing instruments takes a lot out of you, you know? Now… I’m tired just thinking about it. And I've noticed my trousers are getting a bit snug, if you catch my drift. Not a good look.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of fatigue and some weight gain... and you're a craftsman, repairing instruments. That's physically demanding work. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or any recent unintentional weight loss before the weight gain?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Not really. I eat when I'm hungry, I suppose. Nothing fancy. Maybe a bit more lately, if anything. Trying to get some energy somewhere, I guess. Weight loss… no. Definitely not. It's all been… the other way around. Though I wouldn’t know what a proper diet is, either. Just… food. I eat food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite, possible increase. Let’s talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you been experiencing any headaches, changes in your vision, feeling unusually hot or cold, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing major. Just… the usual kind. Changes in vision? No, I don’t think so. I can see alright. Hot or cold… I mean, it’s August. It’s hot, naturally. Nothing out of the ordinary. Look, I'm a practical man. I fix things. I don't really do symptoms.
DOCTOR: I understand you're a practical man, Mr. Redfern, and I appreciate that. But sometimes, even practical people need to address things that aren't immediately visible. To make sure we’re covering all bases, let’s quickly go through a few other things. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. That question. Really? Look, Doctor, I came in here because I’m tired and a bit… soft around the middle. I didn't expect a full-blown medical interrogation. It's… private. I suppose everything’s normal. Ish. It’s not something I spend a lot of time thinking about. Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Redfern. I apologize if I’ve asked anything too personal. It’s standard procedure to cover all possibilities. Let’s switch gears. Do you have any medical conditions currently being treated?
PATIENT: Medicare, if that counts. No, nothing specific. Just… old aches and pains. The usual wear and tear, I suppose. Nothing a bit of liniment can’t fix. Honestly, I haven't been to a doctor in… goodness, probably years. Lost my wife, you see. Didn’t have much reason, after that.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Redfern. That must have been incredibly difficult. Let’s focus on getting you feeling better now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. Always been a healthy sort. A bit run down lately, as we’ve established, but generally robust. Broken a few fingers fixing guitars, maybe. Nothing serious. No hospitals. I dislike them immensely. Too… sterile. Too many… feelings.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, quick family history question. Do any close relatives – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… That’s a tough one. Didn’t keep in touch much, to be honest. Parents… they passed away years ago. Heart trouble, I think. Vaguely remember something about that. Siblings? One brother. Haven’t seen him in decades. Wouldn’t have the foggiest idea what ails him, if anything. Look, I'm not much for reminiscing. It’s… unproductive.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. We can leave that there. Finally, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Liniment. For my back. And occasionally, if I'm really stuck, a bit of ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it. Nothing else. I prefer to… self-treat, if you catch my drift. I don't trust pharmaceuticals. Too many side effects, I imagine. I like a simple life. A simple solution.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The exam. Look, Doctor, I came in here to talk, not to be… prodded. I’m a bit sensitive, you see. Old injuries. I'd rather… skip that part, if possible. Can’t we just… prescribe something? Something for energy? Or maybe a diet plan? Something simple.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand your discomfort. However, to ensure I'm providing you with the best possible care, a physical exam is really important. It's the only way to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Skipping it could mean missing something important. I will be as gentle as possible. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know and we can stop. Would you at least allow me to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… fine. That’s… less intrusive. Heart, I suppose. But no prodding, Doctor. Absolutely no prodding. And quickly, if you please. I haven't got all day. Honestly, this is all rather… unsettling. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Redfern. No prodding, I promise. Just a quick listen and a blood pressure check. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. Everything else sounds okay. Now, if you wouldn’t mind just taking a few deep breaths… Lungs sound clear. Okay. It sounds like we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a blood sugar test. Also, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… Of course. More poking and prodding. Just what I needed. Fine. Do what you have to do. But quickly, please. And can you explain the results to me in… simple terms? None of that medical jargon. I fix instruments, Doctor, not bodies.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Redfern. I will explain everything in plain English. No medical jargon, I promise. The tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue, weight gain, and restless sleep. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan of action. I'll have the lab requisition ready for you. It’s just a standard blood draw and a quick EKG. The lab is just down the hall. Do you need me to write a note for any time off work?
PATIENT: No, no time off. I can manage. I’m… resourceful. Just get the tests done, tell me the results, and let’s be done with this. Honestly, this is quite… disruptive. I had a perfectly good guitar to restore today. A 1963 Stratocaster.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Here’s the requisition. The lab technician will take care of you. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. And please, keep it simple. That’s all I ask. A simple solution. Is that too much to hope for?
