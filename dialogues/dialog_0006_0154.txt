DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks again. Been botherin’ me, on and off. Seems to flare up, then quiet down, then… not quiet. It’s very inconvenient, if you understand. I don't recall exactly when it started, though. A while now, certainly.
DOCTOR: Right, “waterworks.” Okay. So, it’s been going on for a while… can you describe what exactly is bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. What exactly… Well, it burns when I… you know. When I go to the bathroom. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just went. It’s… quite bothersome. It’s not a sharp pain, more of an… irritation. I hope that makes sense. It just feels… wrong. I'm sorry, it’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, frequent urge… alright. And is there any pain in your lower abdomen, or in your back?
PATIENT: Lower… abdomen? Hmm. Not really pain, no. A little… achy, maybe, sometimes. But it comes and goes. And my back… well, my back always aches, Doctor. I'm an old woman. It's just… part of getting older, I suppose. Not related to this, I wouldn't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, achiness, possibly unrelated… Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, goodness, no. I think not. I would certainly remember that. Fever… no, I haven't felt hot. Chills… no. Nausea… no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. I had a bit of a cold last winter, but nothing like… that. I’m quite sure of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well… that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? I… I was married for many years, of course. But that was… quite a long time ago. I am divorced. And… no, Doctor, I am not currently… active. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Of course, yes. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. I think I was allergic to penicillin when I was younger, but that was ages ago. I don’t recall having any problems with it recently. And… medical conditions… Well, my eyesight isn’t very good, that’s why I have these glasses. And my doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, but he said it wasn't anything to worry too much about. I don't take any pills for it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Penicillin allergy, possible history of elevated blood pressure. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I just want to check your abdomen and do a simple urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine test… yes, that sounds sensible. An exam… well, I suppose so. As long as it’s quick. I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see. I wouldn’t want to be late. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Quick and gentle, I promise. If you could just lie down here, we’ll start with the abdomen. I'm just going to listen and feel gently.
PATIENT: Very well. It’s rather cold, isn't it? I do wish they’d warm these things up. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… be quick, if you would.
DOCTOR: Okay… everything seems… fairly normal. No significant tenderness. Sounds okay. Now, I’m going to need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the cup, then finish. Do you need any help with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A sample… yes, I remember those. I suppose I can manage. A mid-stream… you say? I’ll try my best. I hope I don't make a mess. Do you have… a private restroom?
DOCTOR: Yes, right through there. Everything you need is in there. I'll be just outside when you're finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall see what I can do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I hope it’s enough. It was a bit… awkward, but I managed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. This looks fine. Let me just run this test. Okay… it looks like you have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. It’s quite common. That explains the burning and frequent urination.
PATIENT: A… UTI? Oh dear. Is it… serious? And what does one do about it? I haven't had one of those in… well, I don't recall ever having one before. Will I need to be admitted to the hospital?
DOCTOR: No, no hospital needed. It’s usually very treatable with antibiotics. It’s not serious if treated promptly. We’ll start you on a course of antibiotics, and I want you to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. And try to urinate frequently, even if you don't feel a strong urge. It helps flush out the bacteria. I can prescribe a medication called Macrobid, it’s usually very effective. Do you have any allergies to sulfa drugs?
PATIENT: Sulfa… drugs? Oh goodness, I wouldn't have the slightest idea. I… I don’t recall. I haven’t taken anything recently. I just take a little something for my eyesight, and that’s all. Will this… medication have side effects? I don't want to feel unwell.
DOCTOR: Macrobid can sometimes cause a little nausea, or upset stomach. Rarely, it can cause a more serious reaction, but it’s very uncommon. We’ll start with a standard dose for seven days. And if you notice any rash, difficulty breathing, or severe stomach pain, stop taking it immediately and contact me. I will write the prescription, and also provide some instructions on how to prevent future infections. Things like wiping front to back after using the bathroom, and making sure you empty your bladder completely each time.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… rather a lot to remember. Wiping… and emptying. And a rash? I do have sensitive skin, you know. I suppose I can try. But are you certain this is the right thing? I’m always a bit nervous about taking new medications.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wease. It's good to be cautious. UTIs are very common, and Macrobid is a first-line treatment, meaning it's generally considered safe and effective. We'll start with a short course to see how you respond. If you're still having symptoms after a few days, or if you experience any concerning side effects, we can discuss other options. Here's the prescription for the Macrobid, and this handout explains how to take it and what to watch out for. It also has information about preventing future infections. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Oh my. It's… rather small print, isn't it? I'll need my glasses to read this properly. And… well, I suppose not at the moment. But I’m sure I will once I’ve had a chance to look it over. I appreciate your patience, Doctor. It’s just… difficult to keep track of everything. Is there a number I can call if I have problems?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. This is the number for the clinic. You can reach me directly during office hours, or leave a message with the answering service. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. And remember to drink plenty of fluids. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you very much for your time and your kindness. I’ll try my best to follow your instructions. I really do appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I have an appointment to get to.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wease. Get well soon, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good afternoon.
