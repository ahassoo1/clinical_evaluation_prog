DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this tiredness during the day. Even though I'm using the machine every night, you see. It’s just… I still feel sleepy. It’s making things difficult, especially when I'm trying to prepare my lectures. I teach, you know – history, mostly, and different cultures. It requires a bit of focus.
DOCTOR: Right. You're using the machine…and you're still tired. Okay. And how long has this been going on, this daytime sleepiness despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… probably a good three months now, maybe a little longer. I started the machine in April, I believe. And at first, it seemed to help, honestly. But now… it’s creeping back. It's not as bad as it was before, thankfully. But it's enough to be a bother. I find myself needing little naps in the afternoon, which I haven’t done since… well, since before the war, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, three months. And you said it initially helped. Are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me see. I wouldn’t say I’m snoring any more – that was a big problem before, my wife used to complain terribly, God rest her soul. My memory seems alright, though I am 83, you know. I sometimes forget where I put my glasses, but that’s just part of getting old! I don't really wake up feeling gasping for air anymore either, not like I used to. Just… tired. And a bit sluggish, you know? Not quite with it.
DOCTOR: Right. No snoring, memory is…acceptable for your age, and no waking up gasping. Sluggish. Okay. And are you having any trouble concentrating, aside from when you're preparing your lectures?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. It’s not just the lectures. Sometimes when I’m reading… a newspaper, or a book… my mind just wanders. I have to reread paragraphs, sometimes pages, to understand what I’ve just read. It's frustrating, because I enjoy reading. And I’m a pretty quick study, generally. I used to be able to absorb information much faster. Now, it feels like it's taking a lot more effort. It’s… well, it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wandering mind, difficulty concentrating… It sounds like we need to look at a few things. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and ears. Just routine. Then we’ll go from there.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I’ve always believed in listening to the professionals. Just point me in the right direction.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning at your age. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright, deep breaths. I used to be a very active swimmer, you know. Kept me in good shape for years. Though those days are long gone. There. Anything unusual?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, but there's a slight murmur with your heart – likely just age-related, nothing alarming. Now, open your mouth for me. Throat looks fine. No obvious signs of infection. Now, let me check your ears. Ears are clear as well. Alright. Everything seems…within normal limits for your age. The fact that you're still tired despite using the CPAP machine is what concerns me. It could be a number of things. Have you had any blood work done recently?
PATIENT: Blood work? Not recently, no. Perhaps a year ago, maybe two. My regular doctor usually orders it during my annual check-up. But I haven’t seen him since… well, since before the pandemic, actually. I’ve been focusing on getting through things, you know. It’s hard to keep track of everything when you’re getting older. Do you think it's necessary? I don't want to put you to any trouble.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Paske. We need to rule out other potential causes for your fatigue. Anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies…these can all cause similar symptoms. It's standard procedure. I'll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. And while we’re at it, let’s check your A1C to get a baseline for your blood sugar. I'll send the orders to the lab downstairs. They'll draw some blood. It shouldn't take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can, even if it means taking short naps during the day. And avoid caffeine, especially in the afternoon.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Very thorough. Alright, if you think it’s best. I’ll go downstairs and get the blood work done. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or any particular instructions for the lab?
DOCTOR: No, just the usual. Fasting for 12 hours before the blood draw for the A1C test. Drink plenty of water afterwards. And let the lab technician know you're using a CPAP machine. That’s all. They’ll give you instructions when you get there. I'll have the results sent over as soon as they’re available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It’s good to know someone is looking into this. It’s just… tiring, you know? I'll go downstairs and get this blood work done. Thank you again. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Mr. Paske. The lab is just down the hall to your left. They’ll take good care of you.
