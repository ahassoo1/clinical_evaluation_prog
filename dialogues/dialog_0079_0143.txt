DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 66 years of age. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 66, that's right. Hmm... well, it's a bit... complicated. My daughter, she wants... a baby. And she thinks I should come here, with her, before... before things happen. She says it's important, for... for everything to be okay. I don't really understand all of it, to be honest. Something about making sure I'm... healthy enough? I just want to help her have a happy, healthy baby.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter is planning a pregnancy and wishes for you to be evaluated… as a potential grandfather, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that's... that's right. A grandfather. It feels a little strange, talking about it like this. I'm an older dad, already, you see. My daughter is... well, she's a late baby. That's why she wants to be careful. Is that what you do here? Check if old dads are okay for babies? I don't even know what they check for, at my age. It's been a long time since I worried about… things like this.
DOCTOR: While my primary focus is your overall health, and not specifically whether you are “okay for babies,” it is prudent to assess any potential risks that may impact a future grandchild. It’s good your daughter is thinking ahead. We’ll need to gather some information. Let's begin with a review of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hmm… chronic… that means long-term, right? Let me think. I had… something with my blood pressure, a long time ago. Maybe ten years back? The doctor put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. Felt alright, you see. And… I think I had a touch of… something with my heart once, but it wasn't serious. They did some tests, said it was just a flutter. That was even longer ago. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Does that make sense? I'm not very good with remembering names and things.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Verrall, but it presents a challenge. Discontinuation of medication for hypertension is concerning, and any cardiac history warrants further investigation. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. It was a little white pill, I think. Or maybe it was yellow? They all look the same after a while. The doctor just told me to take it every day. I was feeling alright, so I stopped. I didn't want to be on pills forever, you see? It was a long time ago… I'm sorry I can't remember. I wish I was better at this. My daughter is going to be worried when I tell her I don't remember anything. Is it very bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Mr. Verrall. We need to establish a baseline for your current health status. We’ll need to perform a physical examination and order some blood work to assess your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. Also, an electrocardiogram – an EKG – to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… good. If it helps, I'm happy to do whatever you need. Tests, you say? Blood work? An… EKG? Is that painful? I don't like needles very much, if I'm honest. But if it's for my daughter’s baby, I'll do it. Just tell me what to do. And... will it take long? I have a bit of a… appointment later this afternoon. Nothing important, but still.
DOCTOR: The EKG is entirely painless, Mr. Verrall. Small stickers are placed on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work involves a simple needle prick – I assure you, it’s quite quick. It will take approximately thirty minutes for the blood draw and the EKG, and then we’ll review the results. Let's begin with the physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me. I'd also like to check your blood pressure now, just to get a current reading.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Thirty minutes, you say? That’s… manageable. I’m not very good with standing still, if I'm being honest. My legs aren’t what they used to be. And please, don't mind if I wobble a bit. This isn’t something I do often, standing on scales. I mostly sit these days. Check my blood pressure, you say? Yes, go ahead. I hope it’s not too high, after all this talking. It gets me a little flustered, all these questions.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 141 pounds, and your blood pressure is elevated at 158 over 92. This confirms the need for further investigation. Let’s proceed with auscultation of your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological exam. Please remove your shirt, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then, I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes and perform a few simple balance tests.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I haven’t had my blood pressure checked in… well, a very long time. I always try to avoid doctors, if I’m honest. It makes me nervous. And take my shirt off? In here? Is that… necessary? I mean, I don’t mind, exactly, but… is there no other way? It's just a little awkward, you see. I haven't been undressed in front of a doctor in decades. I’m getting a little… self-conscious now. Perhaps we could skip that part?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, a thorough examination is essential to assess your overall health and identify any potential risks. Auscultation of your heart and lungs is a non-invasive procedure that provides valuable information. It's medically necessary. I assure you, this is a professional setting and complete confidentiality is maintained. If you are uncomfortable, we can proceed with a more limited examination, but it will compromise the accuracy of my assessment. However, given your elevated blood pressure and prior history, I strongly recommend a full examination. Are you able to proceed, or shall we discuss alternative options?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. You’re right, you’re right. I just… I’m just a nervous old man. And my daughter… she wants everything to be alright for the baby. So, yes. Yes, go ahead. I'll take my shirt off. Just… be quick about it, if you would. And try not to laugh, please. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a doctor, and I’m probably not in the best of shape. This is embarrassing. Really embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Breathe deeply, Mr. Verrall. I detect a slight murmur, which requires further investigation with an echocardiogram. Your lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished in the bases. Now, I will perform a brief neurological examination. Please follow my finger with your eyes, and do not move your head.
PATIENT: Murmur? Is that… bad? I’m trying to follow your finger, but my eyes aren't what they used to be. And I get a little dizzy sometimes, if I turn my head too quickly. This is all a bit much, if I'm honest. I feel like I’m failing some sort of test. Just tell me if I’m doing it wrong. My daughter is going to be so worried when she finds out all these things are wrong with me. And what was that word… echo… something? Is that the test with the stickers? Ouch! That tickles! And makes my leg jump. I haven’t done this since school, I think. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: The echocardiogram is a non-invasive ultrasound of the heart, Mr. Verrall. It will provide detailed images of your heart structure and function. The murmur is not necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but it warrants further investigation. Your reflexes are diminished bilaterally, which could be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, potentially related to diabetes or vitamin deficiency. Now, I need to gather some blood samples for a complete blood count, lipid panel, kidney function tests, and a fasting blood glucose level. Does your daughter know of any vitamin deficiencies you have?
PATIENT: Echo… ultrasound… peripheral… neuropathy… It’s all just words, Doctor. I don’t understand any of it. My daughter… she might know? She always tells me to take my vitamins, but I forget. I forget a lot of things these days. She’s very organized, though. She worries about everything. She probably knows if I’m lacking anything. She’s the one who made this appointment, you know. She said I needed to be checked. She’s a very good daughter. But she’s going to be so worried now, when she hears all this… words. Fasting… blood… glucose? Does that mean I can’t eat anything? I had a biscuit with my tea this morning. Will that mess everything up? Is it very bad? Am I very sick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. We have identified a few areas that require further investigation, but that doesn't necessarily mean you are "very sick." It simply means we need more information to ensure your health is optimal. The biscuit with your tea will affect the fasting blood glucose level, so we will need to reschedule that portion of the blood work for tomorrow morning, after you've fasted for at least eight hours. Let's focus on completing the other tests today. Nurse, please draw Mr. Verrall's blood for a complete blood count, lipid panel, and kidney function tests. We will schedule the fasting glucose test for tomorrow morning. For now, try to relax. We will take things one step at a time. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I had a little rash once, a long time ago, when I was a boy, but I don’t remember what caused it. My daughter always asks me about allergies, before she gives me any medicine. She’s very careful. She’s a very good daughter. But I get so flustered, when she asks me these questions. I forget so many things. It’s just… a lot to take in. I just want to help my daughter have a healthy baby. That’s all. Is that too much to ask? I just… I hope I’m not letting her down. This is all so stressful.
DOCTOR: You are not letting your daughter down, Mr. Verrall. You are doing everything you can by being here today. And we will work together to ensure your health is the best it can be. Now, let's focus on completing these tests. The nurse will be with you shortly. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. Before we proceed, I must inquire about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm… Let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped a long time ago. And sometimes, I take a little pill for my… indigestion? When my stomach hurts. But not very often. And… oh! My daughter gives me something for my joints, sometimes. They ache, you see. It’s a little brown pill, I think. But I don’t take it every day. Just when they’re really bad. That’s all, I think. I don't remember the names of anything, if I'm honest. It’s all a bit of a blur. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. My memory just isn’t what it used to be. I'm a bit of a mess, aren't I?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verrall. We will do our best to piece everything together. The intermittent use of medications and supplements is still important information. Do you recall the dosage of the indigestion pill or the joint supplement?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I really don't. My daughter handles all of that. She puts the pills in little containers, with the days of the week on them. I just… take them. I don't pay much attention to the numbers. She tells me how many to take, and I do it. I'm afraid I'm just not very good with details. She's very organized, though. She has a chart for everything. She probably knows the dosage better than I do. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. This is all so stressful, trying to remember everything. I just want to get this over with, so I can go home and relax. Is it much longer now?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verrall. We'll proceed as best we can. It appears your daughter manages your medications. That’s helpful to know. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Once that's completed, we’ll have the initial results within a few days. I’ll need to contact your daughter to obtain a more detailed medication list. In the meantime, I recommend you refrain from taking any new medications or supplements. Do you have any allergies to latex, iodine, or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Latex… iodine… contrast dye… Oh dear, those are all new words to me. I don't think so. I've never had any problems with bandages or anything like that. I've had a few injections, over the years, but I don't remember any allergic reactions. I've never had any… dye, or anything like that. I don't go to the hospital very often. My daughter takes me to the doctor, when I need to go. She's very careful. She always asks me about allergies, before they do anything. But I don't remember ever being allergic to anything. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. This is all so stressful. I just want to go home and relax. Is the nurse here yet? I'm starting to feel a little faint.
DOCTOR: Nurse, could you please assist Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I do feel a little… dizzy. And my chest feels a bit tight. Maybe I should just lie down? I'm afraid I'm not very good with all of this. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Nurse, please monitor Mr. Verrall's vital signs and obtain a complete blood count, lipid panel, and kidney function tests. He's experiencing some mild dizziness and chest discomfort. Let me know if his condition worsens. Just try to relax, Mr. Verrall. The nurse will take good care of you. We will take things one step at a time. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact your daughter to obtain a more detailed medical history. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to inform the nurse if you experience any further discomfort.
PATIENT: .
