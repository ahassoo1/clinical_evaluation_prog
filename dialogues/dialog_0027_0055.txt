DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. I’ve been hearing… things… about medical marijuana. And my husband, bless his heart, thinks it might help with… well, a little sleeplessness. He reads a lot of articles online, you see. I’m here to inquire about getting a certification, if that's the correct term.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're interested in learning about medical marijuana for sleep issues. Yes, "certification" is the correct term, though it depends on the state laws. It’s good you’re being proactive. Before we proceed, I need to gather some information to see if it might be appropriate for you. It’s important to rule out other causes of your sleeplessness first. Could you tell me a little more about this sleeplessness?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it means I don’t sleep well. Honestly. I wake up several times a night. Toss and turn. It's not as if I’m completely exhausted all day, but it’s… disruptive. And my husband says I snore. Loudly, apparently. He’s a very light sleeper, you see. It’s mostly him being bothered, if I’m being entirely truthful. Is this really necessary? I mean, is there a questionnaire? I’m not one for rambling, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. I apologize if my questions seem basic, Ellan. It’s just important to get a complete picture. A questionnaire would be helpful. I have one here… it will ask about the timing of your sleep issues, how long they’ve been going on, and any other symptoms you might be experiencing. While you’re filling that out, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Very well. Medical conditions… Let me see. I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it’s nothing debilitating. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I manage it with… well, with a sensible diet, mostly. And regular walks. I don’t take any pills, if that’s what you’re asking. I prefer a natural approach, Doctor. My mother always said… I suppose that’s all. Are you certain this questionnaire is absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ellan. It helps me understand if medical marijuana is a safe option for you, given your health history. And to ensure it won't interact with anything else. Even natural approaches can have potential risks. It also asks about any medications you've taken in the past, even if you're not currently taking any. Just to be thorough. Take your time. And please, let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. It's just… all this paperwork. It feels a bit excessive for a little trouble sleeping. Honestly, in my day, a cup of chamomile tea was enough. But I suppose times have changed.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ellan. It's important to get this right. While you're completing that, perhaps I could ask a few questions about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Really, Doctor? What possible relevance could my aunt Mildred’s bunions have to my sleep? I fail to see the connection. With all due respect, I came here for a certification, not a genealogical investigation. It feels as though you are deliberately trying to prolong this process. Is there a fee for all this… scrutiny?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm causing you any frustration, Ellan. Family history can be relevant. Some conditions that affect sleep can have a genetic component. And it helps me get a broader understanding of your overall health. There's no additional fee for gathering this information, Ellan. It's part of a standard medical evaluation. But if you'd prefer, we can skip that part and focus solely on the questionnaire. It’s entirely up to you.
PATIENT: Very well. Skip the family history. Honestly, Doctor, I barely remember my second cousin twice removed, let alone any ailments he might have suffered. Just… get on with it. I'm a busy woman, you know. And I expect results. Is this certification something you can provide quickly, or will I be subjected to further… investigations?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I understand your time is valuable. Let's focus on the questionnaire then. Once you’ve completed that, I’ll need to do a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential causes of your sleeplessness. It won’t be extensive, just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Of course. As if I haven't been thoroughly examined by doctors throughout my entire life. Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But I warn you, I have a low tolerance for unnecessary probing. And I expect a full explanation of any potential side effects before I agree to anything. I am not one to be trifled with, you know. And I have a very good memory. A surprisingly good memory, considering my age. Now, where was I…?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I will explain everything thoroughly and answer any questions you may have. A full explanation is standard procedure. Take your time. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you experience any discomfort during the exam. We can stop at any time.
PATIENT: There. Finished. Now, let’s get this over with. I haven't got all day, Doctor. And please, be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ellan. Alright, let’s proceed with the physical exam. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see how listening to my heart and lungs will determine whether or not I can obtain a little peace and quiet at night. It all seems rather… theatrical, if you ask me. Now, what's next? Perhaps a brain scan? A full body X-ray? I wouldn't be surprised.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ellan. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleeplessness. I'm just trying to be thorough. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. It's important to get an accurate reading. And I assure you, no brain scans or full body X-rays are planned at this time.
PATIENT: 140 over 90? That's… a little high, isn't it? I told you I manage it with a sensible diet and regular walks! Perhaps your equipment is faulty. Or you’re applying it too tightly. Honestly, Doctor, I am not accustomed to being treated like a… a specimen.
DOCTOR: You're right to question it, Ellan. It is slightly elevated. It’s not uncommon for blood pressure to fluctuate, especially during a medical visit. It's possible the reading is a little high due to anxiety, or simply the fact that you're in a clinical setting. I can take it again in a few minutes after you've had a chance to relax. To be thorough, I would like to do a quick neurological exam. It's just a few simple tests to assess your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Honestly, Doctor, you are determined to put me through the wringer, aren’t you? Very well. Proceed with your… tests. But I warn you, my reflexes aren’t what they used to be. And I haven’t been particularly graceful since… well, since my wedding day.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s begin. First, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I've had more challenging tasks than following a finger, you know. Now, what’s next? A balance beam? A complicated series of hand-eye coordination exercises?
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient pressure? Honestly, I have quite strong hands for my age. I used to be a very skilled gardener, you know. And I’ve always had a firm handshake. It’s a sign of character. Now, are we nearing the end of this… ordeal? I have a luncheon appointment to attend, you know. And I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, you have very strong hands. Now, let's test your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs uncrossed and relax your arms. I'm going to gently tap your knees with a small hammer. This may feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: A hammer? Really, Doctor? You’re going to hit my knees with a hammer? Honestly, I am beginning to question your bedside manner. Very well. Proceed with your… tapping. But I warn you, if you cause me any discomfort, I will be lodging a formal complaint. And I have a very good lawyer.
DOCTOR: It's just a gentle tap, Ellan. Not a hit. It’s a standard reflex test. It helps assess the function of your nerves. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my nerves? Honestly, this is becoming quite alarming. Very well. No allergies to medications, thankfully. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. A natural approach is always best, as I’ve already explained. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a perfume once, many years ago. But that hardly counts. Now, are we finally nearing the end of this process? I'm beginning to feel quite faint. And I have a luncheon appointment to attend. A very important luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes can be normal, especially with age. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. However, it’s something to be aware of. No allergies, that’s good. And you prefer a natural approach, I understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you repeat yourself? I’ve already stated that I do not take any pills. Or any medications. Or any herbal supplements. I manage my health with a sensible diet and regular walks, as I’ve already explained. It's a testament to my self-discipline, frankly. Now, are we finally going to discuss this certification? Or are you going to continue interrogating me about my lifestyle? I assure you, I am a very healthy woman for my age. And I have a luncheon appointment to attend. A very, very important luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Let's discuss the possibility of medical marijuana certification. Based on your reported symptoms of difficulty sleeping and frequent awakenings, medical marijuana could be an option. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes, I would like to proceed with caution. I would recommend a consultation with a cardiologist to assess your blood pressure and a neurologist to evaluate your reflexes before proceeding. Would you be open to those referrals?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? A neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, are you serious? After all this, you’re telling me I need to see two more doctors? It's preposterous! I came here for a simple certification, not a full-scale medical investigation. I don't have time for endless appointments and unnecessary tests. And frankly, I'm beginning to question your competence. I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life, and I refuse to be subjected to this… this ordeal. I think I’ve heard enough. I will be taking my business elsewhere. And I would appreciate a refund for this… waste of my time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon appointment to attend. A very, very, very important luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. I apologize for the inconvenience. While I respect your decision, I felt it was my duty to ensure your safety and rule out any potential underlying medical conditions before proceeding with medical marijuana certification. I can provide you with a list of cardiologists and neurologists in the area if you change your mind. And I’m happy to provide a refund for the consultation fee. Have a pleasant luncheon.
