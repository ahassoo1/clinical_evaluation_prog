DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Percell, please. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band sometimes, other times it’s more of a dull ache. Been botherin’ me for…oh, let me think…about two weeks now, I reckon. Not constant, thankfully, but when it hits, it hits.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Two weeks of headaches…and you describe it as a tight band or a dull ache in the back of your head. And it's not constant, it comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about when it comes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, really. I’ve tried thinkin’… it doesn’t happen after I eat certain things, or if I’m out in the sun. Sometimes it's there in the mornin', other times it starts later in the day. I’ve noticed…well, maybe when I’m a little stressed. My daughter’s been havin’ some trouble, and that’s been on my mind a lot lately. But even when things are quiet, it can still pop up. It’s a bit… unpredictable, I guess you could say.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable and potentially linked to stress. That's helpful. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give these headaches at their worst?
PATIENT: Oh, zero to ten, huh? Let me think… I've had some pretty bad headaches in my life, workin' outdoors and all. This isn't that bad, thankfully. I’d say… maybe a six? It’s not crippling, doesn’t make me wanna lie down and close the curtains, but it’s definitely noticeable and makes it hard to concentrate. It’s just…annoying, more than anything. A solid six, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six, noticeable and interfering with concentration. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… no nausea, thankfully. No blurry vision. I haven’t noticed any dizziness or anything like that. I have felt a little… tired lately, but I just figured that was my age catchin’ up to me! Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff when the headache’s bad, like I’ve been lookin’ down at things for too long. But no nothin’ major, really. Just…the headache and maybe a bit of tiredness and a stiff neck sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, no vision changes, no dizziness. Tiredness and occasional neck stiffness. And you said it's been about two weeks. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the headaches yourself?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve tried a few things. Mostly just…restin’ and drinkin’ plenty of water. I've taken some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, a couple of times, but they don’t seem to do a whole lot. Maybe take the edge off for a little bit, but it always comes back. My wife used to make me chamomile tea when I had headaches, but… well, that was a while ago now. I haven't really found anything that truly knocks it out, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Rest, fluids, ibuprofen with limited relief. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological check, and feel around your neck. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds just fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit of lookin’ over, long as it helps figure out what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s not uncommon. I’m feeling some tightness in the muscles at the back of your neck. I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination now. Everything seems normal neurologically. Now, just look straight ahead, and I'm going to shine a light in your eyes. Pupils are normal.
PATIENT: Well? Everything look okay, Doctor? You look like you’re writin’ a whole lot of things down. Is it somethin’ serious? I haven’t been feelin’ too worried, but a headache hangin’ around for two weeks… it’s just enough to make a fella wonder.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Based on the exam, it doesn't seem like anything immediately serious. Your neurological exam was normal, which is good. Your blood pressure is a little high, and there is some tenderness in your neck muscles. It sounds like you’re experiencing a tension headache, likely exacerbated by stress. However, given your age and the recent onset, and the elevated blood pressure, I want to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to get a baseline and make sure everything else is functioning normally. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, I’m happy to get those tests done. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? Especially with my age. I haven't had an EKG before…is it painful or anything? I always get a little nervous around these things. But yeah, go ahead with the blood work and that…EKG thing. Whatever it takes to figure out what's goin’ on.
DOCTOR: No, the EKG isn’t painful at all. It's completely non-invasive. We just attach some small sticky pads to your chest and arms to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. We'll get those orders sent to the lab now. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend continuing with rest and hydration. Try to manage your stress as best as you can. We can discuss some techniques if you’d like. And I'm going to prescribe a muscle relaxant for nighttime use to help with the neck tension. It might help you sleep better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds good, Doctor. Muscle relaxant sounds… nice, actually. Sleep hasn’t been the best lately, to be honest. And yeah, stress… that’s just part of life, I guess. Maybe you can tell me some of them techniques? Anything to help calm things down. As long as it doesn’t involve too much… bendin’ or stretchin’ – my back ain’t what it used to be. But yeah, the blood work and the medicine… and whatever you recommend for the stress. I appreciate you lookin’ into it.
DOCTOR: Alright. For stress, simple deep breathing exercises can be very helpful. Try inhaling slowly through your nose, filling your belly with air, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. You can do that several times a day, even just for a few minutes. Another technique is progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body. We can go through it together if you'd like, or I can give you a handout with instructions. Now, I'm sending the orders for the blood work and EKG to the lab now. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. The prescription for the muscle relaxant is also being sent to your pharmacy. I’d like to see you back in one week to discuss the results and see how you're doing. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, a week sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. I’ll try them breathin’ exercises… I’ve heard of them, but never really got around to tryin’ ‘em. Maybe now’s the time. And I'll make sure to get those tests done. A week it is. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. I feel a whole lot better just knowin’ we're lookin’ into it. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your headache worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, I'll see you back in one week. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. I will. And thank you again for everything. Bye now.
