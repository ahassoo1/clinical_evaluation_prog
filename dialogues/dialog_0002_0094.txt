DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. My husband... he say I need come. Something about… learning? I forget. He worry too much, you know. I work, I busy. Not sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about something and encouraged you to come in for a check-up. That’s good of him to be proactive. Even if you don’t feel sick, it's always a good idea to make sure everything is okay. "Learning" might refer to some recent test results we have on file, or just a general health check. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Normal. I work hard. Sheet metal… it heavy. Sometimes my back ache, but what woman doesn't have back ache? I take… pills. The red ones. Husband buy. Don’t ask me the name, I just take them. Everything okay. Really. Why you ask so many questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re working with sheet metal – that is physically demanding work. And you’ve been taking red pills for your back pain, purchased by your husband. I ask questions because it helps me get a full picture of your health, even if you feel generally okay. It’s not about doubting you, it’s about making sure we aren't missing anything. Could you tell me a little more about the back pain?
PATIENT: More? It’s… in my back. Sometimes it sharp, sometimes dull. When I lift… the metal, it worse. I just… push through. No time to stop. Husband say I need to rest, but who pay the bills if I rest? He doesn't understand. It always happen after long shift, okay? Now, are we done?
DOCTOR: I understand completely about needing to keep working. It sounds like the pain is definitely worse with lifting and after long shifts, and it’s located in your lower back – sometimes sharp, sometimes dull. Let me just quickly pull up your information in the system… okay. I see your height and weight are listed here. And that you are currently uninsured. To get a better idea of what might be going on, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? I don’t like doctor poking around. Is that necessary? I told you, I’m fine. Husband always worry too much about everything. What will you even do? Just tell me if I need more red pills. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Airam. It’s perfectly okay to feel that way. It’s a very basic exam, just checking your back to see if I can pinpoint where the pain is coming from and assess your range of motion. It will involve me gently feeling your back, and asking you to move around a little. It helps me to rule out anything serious and give you the best advice. We don’t have to do it if you’re really uncomfortable, but it will give me a lot more information than just talking. I promise to be gentle and explain everything as I go. Would you be willing to try it?
PATIENT: Fine. But quick. And gentle, you said. Don’t go poking too much. I have things to do. Husband will be mad if I’m late. Just… get it over with. And tell me when I can go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. It won’t take long. If you could just lie down on your stomach on the table for me, that would be great. I'll start by just feeling your spine and the muscles around your lower back. Okay, I’m just going to gently press here… and here. Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ow! Stop! That hurts! See? I told you. What did I tell you? You poking too hard. My husband say I have weak back, maybe that it. You just making it worse. Be careful!
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I'm so sorry. I clearly touched a sensitive spot. My apologies. I was trying to assess for any muscle spasms or tenderness, but I won't push if it's causing you pain. So, tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region... It does sound like there's some inflammation or strain there. Can you try to point to the exact spot that hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right... here. Sort of all over, but mostly here. When I bend over, it really bad. And when I lift… anything. It just aches all the time, really. It’s just… work. It always happens. Husband says I need new job, but what else I do? I no have fancy schooling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generalized tenderness in the lower lumbar region, worsened with bending and lifting. It sounds like this is a chronic issue, related to the physical demands of your job. It’s good that you’re aware of what triggers the pain. Just to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to check your reflexes and range of motion a little bit. Can you try to sit up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Ow... that not so good either. Everything hurts. Why you need me to do all this? Just give me something for the pain. Red pills always work… mostly. I need to go. Husband waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see you're in a lot of discomfort. It’s definitely not ideal, and I want to get you some relief. Limited range of motion, pain with flexion… While red pills might be helping temporarily, I’m concerned about you continuing to work in pain without knowing the underlying cause. I'm hesitant to just prescribe more medication without a clearer picture. I’m going to be honest with you: Given your limited insurance options, getting imaging like an X-ray would be ideal to rule out any fractures or other structural issues. Unfortunately, without insurance, that’s going to be expensive. What I can do is recommend some physical therapy exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, and suggest some over-the-counter pain relief options. However, if the pain worsens or doesn't improve within a week, you really should consider exploring options for getting an X-ray. Would you be open to me writing you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the immediate discomfort, along with a referral for physical therapy?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant… okay. And physical therapy… but I busy. Husband will mad. Fine. Whatever. Just… write it down. I need to go. This take too long. Tell me where to pick up the paper. And don’t bother with long explanation. I understand. Pain, pills, go home. That it.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I’ll write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and a referral for physical therapy. The prescription will be sent electronically to [local pharmacy name], and the referral will be printed for you to take with you. Here you go. This has the address and phone number for the pharmacy, and this sheet has some basic information about the medication, including potential side effects. If the pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. And please try to rest when you can, even if it’s just for a few minutes each day. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. Just… go home. Thank you. Husband will be mad. So, so mad. I need to go. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care of yourself, Airam. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
