DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, now, that’s a good question. My wife, she… she mentioned something about papers. For… time off? Or maybe help with things? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about work and needing to fill things out. I think it has to do with… well, I'm not exactly sure. It’s for… the FMLA, I believe she said? Or disability? One of those.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It can be confusing with all the paperwork. It sounds like your wife is concerned about potentially needing some time off work, or looking into disability benefits. We can definitely sort that out. Before we get into the specifics of FMLA or disability, could you tell me a little bit about why your wife thinks you might need time off?
PATIENT: Well, now… that's the tricky part, isn't it? My memory… it doesn’t work like it used to. Something about feeling… unwell. Tired, mostly. And… a little confused sometimes. It's been going on for a bit, I suppose. Not enough to keep me from work entirely, but… enough that it’s becoming harder. My wife noticed it first, really. She’s a good woman, very observant. I just… I can't recall exactly what she’s concerned about. Is there a way to… look up something? Maybe a note from her?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. Let me take a quick look at your electronic health record – sometimes there are notes from previous visits that might help jog your memory. One moment… Okay, I see notes from your primary care physician, Dr. Sharma, from a visit about six months ago. It seems you reported increasing fatigue and some difficulty with short-term memory. Dr. Sharma ordered some initial blood work and a cognitive assessment. Do you recall that visit?
PATIENT: Ah, Dr. Sharma, yes! A very nice woman. Six months ago… hmm. The blood work… yes, I remember something about that. Lots of poking and prodding, if I recall correctly. And the assessment… was that the one with all the pictures and the questions? Yes, I think so. It was a bit frustrating, to be honest. I kept forgetting what I was supposed to be doing. That sounds about right, doesn't it? So, she was worried about… the tiredness and the forgetting? Is that what this is all about? My wife must have been concerned enough to bring me here, then. It’s good she does. I really don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what the notes indicate, Mr. Limtiaco. Dr. Sharma was concerned about your fatigue and memory difficulties, and wanted to investigate further. It's very good your wife brought you in. Do you recall what the results of the blood work and assessment were?
PATIENT: Results… now that's a difficult one. I seem to recall Dr. Sharma saying everything looked… mostly normal. But she said the cognitive assessment showed some… mild impairment? That’s the word she used, I think. She wanted to monitor things, and recommended I see a specialist. Something about a neurologist? But I… I haven't gotten around to it, honestly. Life gets in the way, you know? And I didn't feel that bad, just… a little forgetful and tired. I probably should have gone, though. My wife was quite insistent. It's all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like Dr. Sharma did a good initial assessment, and identified some areas that warranted further investigation. You're right, seeing a neurologist would have been a good next step. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. And then I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, if that's alright with you. We'll start with your current symptoms. Besides the fatigue and forgetfulness, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Other changes… hmm. Let me think. My wife says I’ve been a bit more… irritable lately. Snappier, she calls it. Which isn't like me, usually. And I’ve been… losing things. Keys, mostly. Or my glasses. Though, to be fair, I’ve always been a bit misplacing things. But it feels more frequent now. And… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. Like they’re right there, on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't get them out. Does that make sense? It's frustrating, mostly. And I’m sleeping… not as well as I used to. Wake up a lot during the night. That's about it, I think. It’s a lot, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit, Mr. Limtiaco, but it’s good you’re sharing all of this with me. All of these symptoms – the irritability, losing things, difficulty finding words, and disrupted sleep – are important pieces of the puzzle. They certainly point towards a need for further investigation. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Let me see. I had the flu, of course, a few times. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. Nothing serious. My wife always handles the medical things, so I don't always recall. I think… I think Dr. Sharma mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high last year? She put me on a diet, but I haven't been very good about following it, to be honest. I don’t believe I have any major illnesses, though. Nothing diagnosed, anyway. I’ve always been a healthy man, all things considered. A bit forgetful lately, but… healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Borderline high cholesterol is good to know. And no other significant medical history is also useful information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was very young, a long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once, many years ago, for a brief stay. Just a bad bout of food poisoning, nothing serious. A quick overnight stay, and then I was right as rain. Nothing else, I don't believe. My wife would certainly remember if there was anything more significant. She has a very good memory, you know. A much better memory than mine, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a brief hospitalization for food poisoning. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My parents… they both lived to a good old age, thankfully. My father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, I believe. But I’m not sure what exactly. And my mother… she was always very healthy, as far as I know. My sister… she had some trouble with her memory later in life, but I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago, and we haven’t spoken in years. It's all a bit hazy, honestly. I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history, to be perfectly frank. It wasn't something we talked about much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing your father had heart trouble is good to note. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, let me see… My wife keeps track of all this, thankfully. I take a small dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as Dr. Sharma prescribed. And a multivitamin every day. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. Sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches, but that’s only when I really need it. She's very careful about making sure I take everything on time. I'm lucky to have her.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a multivitamin. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, as far as I know. My wife always asks before she cooks anything, just in case, but I’ve never had a problem. Nothing that I’m aware of, no. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Don’t have many sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let's talk briefly about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would have my hide if I even thought about it! And alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing excessive. A glass here and there, that’s all. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I’m a church man, Doctor. A simple, peaceful life. I don’t partake in any of that, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for being so open. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical and neurological exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. I’m not very good with… poking and prodding, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. It will just involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a few simple tests to assess your reflexes, balance, and memory. First, let’s start with your vital signs. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. Not as nimble as I used to be, but I can manage. Ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88, pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That's a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Deep breath in… and out… Everything sounds clear, but I do detect a slight murmur. We'll need to investigate that further if it persists.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Hmm. I don’t recall Dr. Sharma mentioning anything about a murmur. Is that… serious? My wife always worries about my heart, you see. She lost her grandfather to a heart condition. Is it something we should be worried about, Doctor? Perhaps another test? I just want to make sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: It's good that your wife is vigilant, Mr. Limtiaco. A murmur doesn’t necessarily mean there's something serious wrong, but it warrants further investigation. It could be something benign, or it could indicate a valve issue. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of the heart. It's a non-invasive test that will give us a detailed look at your heart structure and function. Before we discuss scheduling that, let's continue with the neurological exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. First, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Happy to cooperate. This way… and that way… Keeping my head still… Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I’m not being too clumsy. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Limtiaco. Your eye movements seem normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms, and I’ll gently tap your tendons with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Good reflexes… a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let's check your balance. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Steady as she goes… Although, I wouldn’t recommend putting me in a gymnastics competition just yet. There we are. Not as steady as I used to be, but I’m still upright. Do you want me to close my eyes? Or walk a straight line? Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Let's start with standing with your feet together and your eyes open. Then we'll try with your eyes closed. Just a simple test to assess your balance. Okay, you seem stable for now. Now, could you please close your eyes for a moment and try to maintain your balance?
PATIENT: There we go… a little wobbly, perhaps. My wife always says I have terrible balance. I suppose she’s right. Is that normal, Doctor? I don’t want to fall. Perhaps I should sit down.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Mr. Limtiaco. That's a little unsteady, yes. It's common to have some balance issues as we age, but we'll want to investigate this further. Please open your eyes, and let’s sit back down. Now, let’s move on to a brief cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It’s nothing to worry about, just a quick check. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… It’s August, isn’t it? August… And it’s… the 2nd? Yes, the 2nd of August. 2025, I believe. Is that right, Doctor? It's easy to lose track of the days, you know. Especially these days.
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Mr. Limtiaco. August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city… hmm. That’s a bit trickier. I… I’m not sure, to be honest. I’ve been to so many places in my life, it's hard to remember them all. Is this… a test, Doctor? Is it a trick question? I know I’m at the doctor’s office, but I don’t recall the name of the city.
DOCTOR: It's not a trick question, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly alright if you don't know. We’re in a suburban area near Kuala Lumpur. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall three words. I'll say them, and then I'll ask you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I'll do my best. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I'll try my best. Go ahead, Doctor. Three words, you say?
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… penny? Is that right? Apple, table, penny. I think… I think I’ve got it. It’s a bit hard to hold them all in my head at once, though.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions. Could you tell me your wife's name?
PATIENT: My wife? Oh, her name is… Leilani. Beautiful name, isn’t it? Leilani Limtiaco. She’s a wonderful woman. A very patient woman. I don't know what I'd do without her.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, do you know what year this is?
PATIENT: The year… hmm. That’s another tricky one. Is it still 2024? No… it must be 2025, right? Yes, 2025. But I’m not entirely sure. I lose track of the years these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Based on the history you’ve provided and the results of the neurological exam and cognitive assessment, it appears you're experiencing some difficulties with memory, thinking skills, and balance. These symptoms are concerning and require further investigation. I recommend an echocardiogram to assess your heart, as well as an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. Would you like me to schedule those tests and the referral for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And I want to get everything sorted out as quickly as possible. My wife is very worried, you see. Yes, please schedule the tests and the referral. Whatever you think is best. I’ll leave it in your capable hands. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate everything you’ve done so far.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. I've scheduled an echocardiogram for next Tuesday at 10 AM and a neurology appointment for two weeks from today. The neurology office will be in contact to confirm the appointment. I'll also send a detailed report to the neurologist so they have a complete overview of your case. In the meantime, it's important to continue with your regular medications and to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’ll just… take it one step at a time. I’ll let my wife handle the details. She’s much better organized than I am. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel a bit better just knowing what’s going on. And knowing there’s a plan. I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you next Tuesday for the echocardiogram. Take care, and please give Leilani my best. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will be sure to give my best to Leilani. You have a good day as well. .
