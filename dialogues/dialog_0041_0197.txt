DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It's nice to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Polczynski. It's nice to meet you too. I’m here about getting a card… a driver’s card, for ride-sharing. You know, like for Uber and Lyft. I need to be sure I can do it legally. I want to get this done quickly if possible, I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay, a medical certification for ride-sharing. Right. So, they require a physical exam to ensure you're fit to drive safely, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Exactly. My daughter helped me with all the paperwork, so I don't have to worry about that part. She said I needed to come here and get checked out by a doctor. It's all very new to me, this ride-sharing business. I used to just… cut wood. A very different kind of driving, I assure you! But I need the extra money.
DOCTOR: I can imagine! Quite a change of pace. Well, we’ll do our best to get you sorted. It's a fairly standard exam, just checking your vision, hearing, reflexes, and a quick look at your overall health. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that’s been fine. And I have a little arthritis in my hands, it gets a bit stiff sometimes, especially in the cold. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to stay active, even if it's just puttering around the garden. I also take something for my blood pressure, a small pill every morning. It’s… lisinopril, I believe. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril… yes, that's a common medication for blood pressure. Good to know. And the arthritis… does it affect your ability to grip the steering wheel or operate the vehicle controls?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's more just a little ache, and stiffness. I can still hold things just fine, and I have no trouble turning the wheel or pressing the pedals. It’s a little worse in the morning, but after I’ve been moving around for a while, it loosens up. Honestly, cutting wood is better for it than not using my hands! I suppose that’s why I’m still able to do this. Do you need me to, like, show you I can grip things? I'm happy to. I just want to get this done quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: No, no need to demonstrate, San. That's good to know. I appreciate you being so thorough. Just want to be sure everything is working as it should. Have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Not really. I wear glasses for reading, and I get them checked every year. I had my last check-up in… March, I think it was. The doctor said my prescription hadn’t changed much. I have trouble seeing things very close up, but that's been the same for years. Everything else seems okay. I can see the road fine when I'm driving, I assure you. I’m very careful. My late husband always said I had excellent night vision, even without glasses. He was a hunter, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Okay, well, perhaps we can do a quick vision screening just to confirm everything is still within safe limits. And then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a general physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. The quicker we get through it, the better. I have a luncheon to get to this afternoon, and I promised to bring the potato salad. My daughter will be very cross if I’m late. She’s a very organized girl, that one. Let’s just get it done, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. Let's get started then. If you could just sit here, and we'll take it one step at a time. First, let's check your vision. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright. Okay, let’s see… uh… is that an “E”? And then… “F”? Oh, and “P”… yes, I think that’s a “P”. This chart is rather small, you know. I'm used to reading much larger print. But I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful. You’re doing well. And now the next line… and then the one after that. Don’t worry if you can’t see them perfectly, just tell me what you think you see.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… that one looks like… a “T”? Or maybe an “F”? It’s very blurry. And the next one… I really can’t make out the letters anymore. They’re just… shapes. I think I need a stronger magnifying glass. My eyes aren't what they used to be, you know. I’m seventy years old! It’s to be expected. Can we just… move on? I’m sure everything else will be fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, San. That's good to know. It seems like your vision might be a little weaker than it used to be, and we might need to get a more detailed eye exam done. But for now, let's proceed with the rest of the physical exam, just to get a complete picture. We can discuss the eye exam afterward. Could you lie back on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Just let me know if you need me to move anything. I’m not as nimble as I once was, you know. And please, don’t take too long. I really must get going soon. This potato salad isn’t going to make itself.
DOCTOR: Of course, San. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Just breathe normally, in and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. Everything sounds… normal, then? That’s a relief. My mother always had a bad heart, so I’m always a little worried about that. But if you say it sounds okay, I trust you. What next? I feel like a bit of a pin cushion already, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything sounds good so far, San. Just routine checks. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This just involves a little tap on your knees and ankles. Nothing to worry about. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Good response. And now I’m just going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Alright. That’s… a little uncomfortable, but not painful. I have a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, so it’s easily bothered. But nothing major. Just a little bit of… pressure. It feels fine. I'm starting to feel a bit chilly, you know. Is this going to be much longer? I really do need to get going. My daughter will be furious if the potato salad is late. She's very particular about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, we’re almost finished. Just a quick check of your ears and throat. And then we can discuss the next steps. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within normal limits. Overall, everything seems good, San. However, your vision is slightly diminished, and I would recommend a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist for a more detailed examination. Now, regarding the ride-sharing certification… based on my examination, I can clear you medically, but with the recommendation to get your vision checked and potentially wear corrective lenses while driving. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear! Finally. An ophthalmologist, you say? Hmm. That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. But I suppose if it’s necessary, I’ll have to do it. Corrective lenses while driving… well, I already wear glasses for reading, so that wouldn’t be too bad. I suppose I can manage that. So… you’re saying I can drive for Uber and Lyft? As long as I get my eyes checked and wear my glasses? That’s all I needed to hear. Yes, that’s perfect. Thank you, Doctor. Now, can I please get dressed? And could you perhaps give me a little piece of paper with the ophthalmologist’s name and number? I tend to forget these things, you know. I’m seventy! It happens.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly, San. You are medically cleared to drive, with the recommendation to follow up with an ophthalmologist and wear corrective lenses while driving. I’ll write down a referral for a local ophthalmologist right now. Here you go. Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s very good, and her office is conveniently located near the grocery store. And don't worry about forgetting, it happens to the best of us. Just take your time, and we’ll make sure you’re safe and comfortable on the road. Now, if you need any assistance getting dressed, just let me know.
PATIENT: .
