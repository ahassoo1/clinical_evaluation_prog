DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My wife, bless her heart, she said something about… paperwork? Something to do with time off, I think. From work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I’m with the church, you see, directors work, religious education… and I think I need something filled out. For… FMLA, was it? Or disability? She mentioned one of those.
DOCTOR: Right. So, primarily paperwork for leave from your work at the church. And your wife suggested FMLA or disability. Let’s clarify things. Before we get into forms, can you tell me why you need to take time off?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. It’s been a bit of a blur lately, honestly. I… well, I’ve just not been feeling myself. Tired, mostly. Very tired. And a little… shaky. It’s hard to explain. It started a few weeks ago, I think? Maybe longer. It’s just… everything feels like a lot of effort these days. I’m still going to work, mind you, but it’s… difficult. I don’t remember anything specific happening to cause it, if that makes sense. It just… is.
DOCTOR: "Just is," you say. Alright. And this tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly constant, I'd say. It’s not like… a sudden crash, more like a… weight. Always there. Some days are worse than others, of course. But even on the “good” days, I’m still… drained. It’s hard to get motivated, you know? Even things I normally enjoy… they just feel like too much effort. I used to love gardening, but even that’s become a chore. My wife does most of it now, bless her.
DOCTOR: And has this tiredness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, that's a good question. My wife says I’ve been a bit… forgetful. Which isn’t entirely new, if I'm honest. But she says it’s gotten worse. I sometimes… misplace things. Or forget what I was saying mid-sentence. It’s frustrating, mostly for her, I think. And… maybe a little bit of dizziness now and then? Not falling-down dizzy, just… a little unsteady on my feet sometimes.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and occasional dizziness. And you said unsteady on your feet. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Appetite… now that you mention it, I haven’t been eating as much. Not intentionally, just… don’t feel as hungry, I suppose. And I think I’ve lost a little weight? I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my trousers feel a bit looser. It’s not a lot, mind you, but noticeable. My wife keeps trying to get me to eat more, bless her heart. She makes such lovely meals.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll do a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. This will give us a better starting point. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Sounds sensible. A good check-up is always a good idea. Balance isn't what it used to be, as you might have guessed. Hopefully, this will give you a better idea of what’s going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are… slightly diminished. And I’m going to check your balance now. Please stand up slowly, if you can. Balance is somewhat impaired, as you noted. There’s a slight unsteady gait. Okay. It sounds like we have a constellation of symptoms here: fatigue, weight loss, forgetfulness, dizziness, and some neurological findings. We need some lab work to rule out potential causes. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also do a urine analysis. I'll also order a CT scan of the head, just to be on the safe side, given the forgetfulness and dizziness.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds like… a lot of tests. A CT scan? Is that… serious? I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor, I really do. But all those tests… I hope it’s nothing too worrying. I’m just a simple man, you see. Directors work is important, but it’s not exactly brain surgery. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: The CT scan is standard procedure given your symptoms, Mr. Limtiaco. We need to rule out any structural issues. As for what you should do… avoid strenuous activity. And ensure you're getting adequate rest. I also recommend that you avoid driving until we have the results of these tests. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk. They’ll schedule you for the blood work and the CT scan. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. It is critical that you keep this appointment. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No strenuous activity… and no driving. That’s… inconvenient, but I understand. One week… yes, I can do that. I’ll make sure to mark it on the calendar. And the lab order… yes, I’ll go to the front desk right away. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… try not to worry too much, I guess. It’s just… all a bit overwhelming. Thank you for taking the time to listen, Doctor. I appreciate your care.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Limtiaco. The nurse will escort you to the front desk. Please let me know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Next.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Thank you again, Doctor. I will, I will. .
