DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I coughed up some blood. It scared me a little. Not a lot, but enough to come get checked.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we want to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It happened… two days ago, I think. It was in the morning, after I woke up. Mostly just… streaks of red in my spit. Not a whole lot, like I said. And it hasn’t happened since, not that I’ve noticed. I was a little worried it might be… something serious.
DOCTOR: Right, two days ago, in the morning. And only the one instance so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Just the one time. And… it wasn’t much. I didn’t even… I didn’t know what to do, really. I just… wanted to be sure. Is it… bad? I'm sorry, I don’t mean to be difficult. I just get worried easily, I think.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being difficult at all. It's good you came in. Any amount of blood is worth checking out. To get a better idea of what might be going on, let's go through some questions. First, have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside the coughing?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Other symptoms… Let me think. I have been a little tired lately, more than usual. But I thought that was just… because of the heat. And… maybe a little bit of a chest pain, but it’s not… sharp, just sort of achy. And… I’ve been losing my appetite a bit. Nothing major, though. I just don’t feel as hungry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Tiredness, chest pain – achy, you said – and a decreased appetite. Okay. And how about a fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I haven’t felt hot at all. And no chills… and no night sweats either. I sleep pretty normally, I think. Not sweating more than usual. It’s been very warm, so I do wake up a little warm sometimes, but… not like a fever, you know? Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Now, have you had a recent cough or cold, or any respiratory infection recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had a little sniffle about a month ago, but it didn't last long. Just a day or so. Nothing that needed any medicine or anything. I didn’t even really think about it. It wasn’t a bad cold at all. Just… a little tickle in my nose. I thought it was the allergies. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Allergies can sometimes cause irritation. Okay. And have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any wheezing when you breathe?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t been short of breath. And no wheezing, no. I walk every day, and I haven’t had any trouble with that. I can… breathe normally, I think. I haven’t noticed anything different. Is that… good? I keep worrying I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being thorough. No shortness of breath or wheezing is good. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a little while, but it’s been under control with medicine for a few years now. And… my husband… he passed away last year. It was… a long illness. Other than that… no, I don't think so. I've always been pretty healthy, until… well, you know. Does the blood pressure matter? I take my pills every day, like I’m supposed to.
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you for telling me. We’ll note that you have a history of controlled hypertension. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been difficult. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It… it was very hard. Surgeries… I had my appendix taken out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago. Other than those two… no. That's all I can remember. They were… routine, I think. Nothing major. I don't think they would be related to this, would they?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hysterectomy, both in the past. We'll document those. And no, it's unlikely they're related, but it's good to have the information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than your blood pressure medicine?
PATIENT: Yes, just the blood pressure pills. Amlodipine, I think it's called. And… sometimes I take an allergy pill, but only when the pollen is really bad. It’s… Cetirizine. But I haven’t taken one in a while, not recently. That’s all, I promise. I try not to take too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Amlodipine and Cetirizine as needed. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat almost anything, and I haven’t noticed any problems with pills. My husband… he had a lot of allergies, but I don’t seem to have gotten any of them! Is that… unusual? I’m sorry, I’m rambling, aren't I? I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all. It's good to know you have no known allergies. Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he quit a long time ago. I always told him it was bad for his health! I try to be very careful about my health. I eat healthy, and I exercise every day. I walk about thirty minutes, if the weather is nice. Is that enough? I worry about doing enough.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Walking 30 minutes a day is great. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: I… I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one glass. A white wine, usually. Not very often, though. Maybe once or twice a week. My husband used to drink more, but… well. I don’t really enjoy it much. I don’t need it. Is that… okay? I just want to make sure I tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Small amounts of alcohol are not a concern. Alright, one last thing. Is there anyone in your family with a history of lung problems, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Let me think… My father had… he had some sort of chest infection when he was older, but I don't know much about it. It was a long time ago. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. But… no one in the family, that I know of, has had any lung problems or bleeding problems. They were… pretty healthy people, mostly. I worry about this being something serious. Is it possible it’s just… nothing?
DOCTOR: Okay. No family history of lung problems or bleeding disorders. Alright, Ms. Weichers, thank you for providing all of that information. It's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listening to your lungs and checking your heart, and maybe taking your blood pressure again. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I'm a little nervous, but… I want to know what's going on. I just… I want to be healthy. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly. And again. Good. Okay. Lungs sound clear, but I do hear some… faint crackles on the lower right side. Not significant, but something to note. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Let’s check your oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. Now, I’d like to feel your lymph nodes in your neck and collarbone. No swelling detected. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but given the small amount of blood you coughed up and the faint crackles in your lung, I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. A chest X-ray… will it hurt? And will it take long? I don’t mind, if it will help find out what’s going on. The crackles… that sounds scary. Is that something bad? I'm sorry, I keep asking questions.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not a bother at all. It's good to ask questions. The X-ray won’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. It shouldn’t take long at all, maybe five or ten minutes. And the crackles… they can be caused by a lot of things, Ms. Weichers. It could be a minor infection, a little bit of fluid, or nothing at all. That’s why we’re doing the X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll also order a complete blood count, just to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. An X-ray and a blood count. I’m glad you’re being thorough. I… I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so carefully. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something to find out what’s going on. Where will I go for the X-ray? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. The X-ray can be done right here at the clinic. The technician is just down the hall, and I’ll have them come get you in a moment. The results usually take about an hour to come back, and I’ll review them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like more coughing, shortness of breath, or fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anyone you'd like me to notify about the results?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I… I don't have anyone to notify. My husband… he’s gone, as I mentioned. I'll be alright. An hour… I can wait. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little less worried, knowing we’re getting it checked out. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I’m glad I could help ease your mind. I’ll let the technician know you’re ready, and they’ll come get you shortly. If you need anything at all while you wait, please don’t hesitate to ask the nurse at the front desk. Nurse, can you please send the X-ray technician to exam room three?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate it.
