DOCTOR: Hi Delmon, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but please, call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Chriselda. Okay. They sent me here... for checkin'. Not feelin' nothin' wrong, you know? Just... they say I gotta get looked at 'cause of the work. Long time workin' in the ground. That's all. Don't bother me none, this checkin', but they insisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A routine check-up because of your work history, that’s good preventative care. So, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Not a one. I eat my food, sleep my sleep. Maybe a little ache in the bones sometimes, but that's just old age, eh? I be eighty-six years old, you know. Things ache. That don't mean nothin' is wrong wrong. I still strong for my age. Used to carry heavy things, you understand? Still can, if I need to.
DOCTOR: Right, perfectly understandable. A little bit of age-related soreness is very common, and doesn’t always mean something’s amiss. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about this ache?
PATIENT: Thorough? You think I'm lyin'? It's just... in the legs, mostly. And the back. After I been movin' things, you know? Loadin' and unloadin'. Like I said, it's nothin' to write home about. It goes away. Rub some balm on it, take a rest. That's all it needs. You askin' too many questions about nothin'.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm coming across as overly inquisitive, Delmon. I promise I’m not doubting you at all. I just want to get a complete picture. When you say “movin’ things,” are you still doing that type of work currently?
PATIENT: Currently? Hmph. No. Not like before. Old bones, you know? They let me do some lighter things, mostly watchin' the machines, makin' sure the young fellas doin' it right. But movin'... carryin' the weight... that's been a while now. A good while. They keep me 'round 'cause I know the machines. Been workin' with 'em since before they had buttons. But the heavy liftin'? That's for the youngsters.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, mostly observational work now, with a history of heavy lifting. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to walk, or any balance problems?
PATIENT: Balance problems? You think I wobble like a baby goat? No! I walk steady as a rock. Maybe a little slow, but steady. I still go to the market myself, you know? Carry my own bags. Don’t need no help. I ain't fallin' down or nothin'. You askin' silly questions now. I told you, I'm fine. They just wantin' to waste my time, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delmon. I'm not trying to waste your time, and I appreciate you being so direct with me. It's good you're still able to get around and manage your daily activities. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel... what now? You askin' about... goin' to the toilet? Is that what you want to know? Look, I'm an old man. Things change. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less. What does that have to do with movin' things in the ground? This is ridiculous. I don't understand why you askin' me these personal questions. You a doctor, not my mother.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, Delmon. I apologize for getting so personal. I'm trying to rule out any potential issues that could be related to your work history, and sometimes that involves asking about things that feel uncomfortable. It’s good you are able to articulate your concerns. Let's step back for a moment. You mentioned you’ve been working with machines for a long time. Have you ever had any injuries while working with them?
PATIENT: Injuries? A few scrapes and bruises, you know? A cut here, a bump there. Not nothin' serious. Once, a machine part fell, almost hit my foot, but I jumped back quick. Another time, twisted my ankle a little, but walked it off. Mostly just aches and pains. Old man stuff. They gave me some ointment for it. It's all in the past now. I'm a tough man. Always been tough. They worry too much, these young doctors. .
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Minor injuries, mostly resolved. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Just one more quick question about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
