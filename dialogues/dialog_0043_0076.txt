DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, right? Yes, well, it’s my legs. They’re… bothering me a bit. I got these bumps, red ones, on my shins. They hurt, especially when I touch them. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? Hard to keep track these days, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A month of red, painful bumps on your shins. That does sound bothersome. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the bumps a little more?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… round-ish, I guess. Not flat, they kinda stick out a little. And very red, like a really good sunburn red. Not… pus-y, if you know what I mean. Just red and hard. And they’re mostly on the front of my shins, you know, the part that bangs against things. I do a lot of moving things at work, so maybe that's it? They’re not itchy, though, just… sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, round, raised, sunburn-red bumps on the front of your shins, not itchy, just sore. And you suspect it might be related to bumping your legs at work. That's helpful information. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, my work. I move boxes, mostly. Freight, you know? At the warehouse down on… Elm Street, I think it is. Lots of lifting, carrying, and stacking. And walking, lots and lots of walking on concrete floors. Been doing it for… oh, a long time now. My knees aren’t what they used to be, but I manage. It's honest work. The bumps didn’t start right after I started, though. It was gradual, you know? A little sore here, then a bump, then another... something like that.
DOCTOR: So, you’ve been doing freight work for quite some time, involving a lot of lifting, carrying, and walking on concrete. The bumps developed gradually, not immediately after starting the work. That’s good to know. Now, thinking a bit more broadly, have you noticed any other symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really. No fever, no chills, no swelling in my legs except for where the bumps are. I haven’t felt tired more than usual, and my appetite’s been okay. Maybe a little bit of aching in my joints sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. I do get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast, but I’ve always done that, even when I was younger. Does that count? I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… bothered by my legs.
DOCTOR: No fever, no chills, no generalized swelling, appetite is good, occasional joint aches, and a history of dizziness upon standing. You don't feel systemically ill, just bothered by your legs. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so he put me on some pills for it. I take them every day, I think it’s losartan? Something like that. And I got Medicare, so they keep an eye on things. I had my knees looked at once, a long time ago, but they said it was just arthritis. Other than that… not much. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat okay, mostly. And I try to get some rest when I can. Don't know if that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Hypertension managed with Losartan and a history of knee arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, and I take my blood pressure pills every day without any trouble. My wife always asks me if I'm allergic to anything before I try something new, but I always tell her, “Nope, I eat anything!” She laughs at me, says I'm too trusting. But I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. And it sounds like you have a good sense of humor about things, which is excellent. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, aside from the Losartan?
PATIENT: Ah, let me think… besides the Losartan, I take a multivitamin every day. My wife buys them for me, says I need to keep my strength up. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know? The regular kind. Not all the time, just when I need it. And that’s pretty much it, I think. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Losartan daily, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Now, I’d like to take a look at your legs. If you don’t mind, could you please sit on the examination table and lift your shirt a bit so I can get a good look at your shins?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Here you go. Be careful, my skin is a little thin these days. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bumps you mentioned. They are raised, red papules, primarily on the anterior aspect of both shins. They appear to be approximately half a centimeter in diameter. And, as you said, they are firm to the touch. Does this cause you any significant pain?
PATIENT: Ouch, a little bit, yes. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. Like a bruise, almost. But it doesn’t go away. And it’s more tender when I touch it directly, like you’re doing. It's definitely not comfortable. Just a nagging sort of pain. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but it’s always there, you know? Even when I’m not touching it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I notice no signs of open sores or drainage, which is good. The skin around the bumps appears otherwise normal. I'm also checking your pulses in your feet to ensure good circulation. Pulses are strong and regular on both sides. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, these bumps are most likely shin splints – technically, a condition called stasis dermatitis. It's common in individuals with circulation issues, especially those who spend a lot of time on their feet. The prolonged standing and walking can lead to increased pressure in the veins, causing them to become inflamed and lead to these types of skin changes. Do you notice any swelling in your ankles or feet at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. You know, now that you mention it, yes, a little bit. Not much, but my ankles do feel a little puffy sometimes when I get home from work. I usually just put my feet up and it goes away after a while. I figured it was just from being on my feet all day. My wife says I should wear compression socks, but they feel so tight! I don’t like them. So, you think it’s just from my legs being tired and the veins being… what did you say, inflamed? Is it serious? Do I need to worry about it?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you recognize the swelling. The compression socks would be very beneficial, but we can discuss alternatives if you’re not comfortable with them. It doesn't sound like it's anything immediately serious, but it’s important to address it to prevent it from worsening. Stasis dermatitis, as it’s called, is often linked to venous insufficiency - meaning the valves in your veins aren't working as efficiently as they should, making it harder for blood to return to your heart. We can start with some conservative measures. I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible – especially at the end of the day. Try to avoid prolonged standing if you can. And we can discuss a topical cream to help with the inflammation and discomfort. I’m also going to order a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs and confirm if there’s significant venous insufficiency. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ah, a Doppler ultrasound… sounds fancy. Yes, that's alright with me. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get rid of this pain. Elevating my legs, I can do that. And a cream… that sounds good too. No need for fancy socks if I can avoid it. Is the cream something I need a prescription for? And what about the work? I can’t just stop working, you know? I need to keep earning a living.
DOCTOR: Yes, the cream will require a prescription. It’s a topical corticosteroid to help reduce the inflammation and itching. We’ll start with a mild strength and adjust if needed. And I completely understand about work. We don’t want you stopping your job. We can discuss strategies to manage your symptoms while continuing to work. Frequent breaks to elevate your legs, if possible, would be helpful. And ensuring you're properly hydrated throughout the day. I’m going to write you a referral for the ultrasound and a prescription for the cream. I’ll also have the nurse print out some information on venous insufficiency and leg care. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the ultrasound results and how you're responding to the treatment. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, chills, or significant swelling – please contact the office immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: That sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. A plan is always good. Two weeks… alright. I can mark it on the calendar. And I will try to remember to drink more water. My wife will be happy to hear that, she's always telling me to drink more water. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me. And I will let the office know if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions and schedule your ultrasound. Have a good day, and try to take it easy on your legs. .
