DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. It’s… bothersome. Been happening for a bit now, I reckon. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s… well, it’s in my hands, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, I see. The shaking… mostly in your hands. And you said it’s been happening for a “bit now.” Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: A bit… yeah. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer? It’s hard to say. My memory ain’t what it used to be. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m trying to… do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee, or… well, anything that needs a steady hand, really. I used to work with… pipes, lots of pipes. Water and… things. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's been happening for months, perhaps longer, and seems to be more noticeable when you’re using your hands for tasks requiring precision. You mentioned you used to work with pipes—was that a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, very. Lots of lifting, bending, tightening… all sorts of things. It wasn't easy work, but it kept me busy. And it was… important, you know? People need clean water. I don't remember exactly what kind of pipes, though. It all blurs together after a while. My head just… isn’t as sharp as it once was.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you had a very active and important career, Mr. Jezik. It’s not uncommon for memory to change over time. Now, aside from the shaking and some memory difficulties, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I get tired easier, I suppose. Used to be able to work all day without a problem. Now, I need to sit down a lot. And… sometimes I feel a bit… off balance. Not falling or anything, just… wobbly. Is that what you mean? I don’t really… know what to look for, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Jezik. Fatigue and feeling off balance. Have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, or any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Maybe a little ache in my back sometimes, but that's probably just from getting old. Stiffness… sometimes my hands feel a bit tight, especially in the mornings. But it goes away after I move them around a bit. It's nothing major, Doctor. Honestly, I don't want to bother you with all this… I just want to stop shaking. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Mr. Jezik. It's important for me to get a complete picture of what's going on so we can figure out the best way to help you. The shaking is what brought you in, and we’ll address that. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years. But… what did they say? I had a bit of trouble with my heart, I think. A long time ago. And… something with my blood pressure, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I don't really keep track of things like that. My wife used to handle all that… She’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Jezik. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to remember details about past medical issues, especially after such a loss. Do you recall if you were ever hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. There was… one time. A long time ago. I fell off a ladder while working on the pipes. Broke my arm, I think. Spent a few days in the hospital. But that was… decades ago. Everything is just… so long ago. And I don't remember the doctor's names or anything. I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Mr. Jezik. You’re sharing what you remember, and that’s what’s important. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. The doctor took me off most of them years ago. Something about… side effects, I think. I have a little something for my… digestion, sometimes. But that’s it. Just a little something over-the-counter. Nothing serious. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Though, my appetite isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no regular medications, just something occasionally for digestion. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s just a normal allergy, I suppose. Nothing serious. I don't really pay much attention to those things. My wife used to remember all that stuff…
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Mr. Jezik, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing the shaking and other symptoms you’ve described. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could. I have… things to do. Not important things, really. Just… things. I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I’ll do my best to be as efficient as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: There you go. It's worse when I try to hold them still, you see. Like they have a mind of their own. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the tremor. It appears to be a resting tremor, but we’ll need to do a few more tests to be sure. Now, could you please tap your finger to your thumb repeatedly?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult. It feels like I’m fighting against my own body. It's tiring, you know? Even just doing this simple thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, now could you please close your eyes and extend your arms in front of you again?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s… more pronounced when I can’t see them. It feels like they’re going to fly off. This is… not good, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, let’s see how you walk. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There you go… It's… not as smooth as it used to be. I have to concentrate just to keep my balance. It feels like I’m walking on a boat, you know? All… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. Thank you. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. I also want to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are slightly diminished.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Is that… bad? I don't remember the doctor ever mentioning a murmur before. Diminished… what does that mean? Is it serious? I just want to know what's going on. This shaking is… frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious. The murmur is a soft one, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but we’ll want to investigate it further with an echocardiogram—an ultrasound of your heart. Diminished reflexes can be normal with age, but it’s important to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. Based on the exam, and what you’ve told me about the shaking, the fatigue, and the imbalance, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition that causes shaking, often in the hands. Another possibility is Parkinson’s disease, although that typically presents with other symptoms as well. We also need to rule out any medication side effects, even from over-the-counter medications, and consider a possible vitamin deficiency. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I’d also like to schedule an echocardiogram to evaluate your heart, and possibly a neurological consultation with a specialist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear… so many tests. It sounds… complicated. Parkinson’s disease… that’s… serious, isn’t it? I just want to stop shaking. Is there anything… anything at all we can do right away? I’m not sure I can handle all these tests and appointments. It's all a bit… much.
DOCTOR: I understand that it feels overwhelming, Mr. Jezik, and I apologize for giving you so much information at once. It's important to be thorough, but we can take things one step at a time. For immediate relief of the shaking, there are a few things we can try. Some people find that holding a warm object, like a cup of tea, can help reduce tremors. We can also explore some simple exercises to improve your hand strength and coordination. I’m going to write you a prescription for propranolol, a medication that can sometimes help reduce tremors, but it’s important to start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I will also give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, who is an excellent specialist in movement disorders. She will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis and recommend a long-term treatment plan. I want to reassure you that Parkinson’s disease is not always the cause of tremors, and there are many other possible explanations. We are going to run these tests to get a clearer picture and determine the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds better. A prescription… and the neurologist. Dr. Sharma, you say? I’ll… I’ll try to schedule an appointment. It’s just… everything is so much. Holding a warm cup… I suppose that won’t hurt. I’ll try that. Thank you, Doctor. For… for not just dismissing it. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It's my job to listen and help you find answers. I’m glad I could offer some reassurance and a plan forward. I’ll have the nurse print out the prescription and the referral information for you. She can also help you schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma if you’d like. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to discuss the results of the tests and see how you're responding to the medication. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… the tests and the neurologist. And the prescription. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I should go now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day.
