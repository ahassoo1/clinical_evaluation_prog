DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I’m here because I want to be perfectly clear – I don’t want any problems getting pregnant. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Fifty-one is not a spring chicken. I expect efficiency. And competence.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. You want to ensure a healthy pregnancy. Very good. Let's gather some information to see where we stand. Just to confirm, you are actively trying to become pregnant at this time?
PATIENT: Actively? As in, am I… attempting? Is that what you’re asking? Look, Doctor, I wouldn’t be here if I wasn't serious. My husband—ex-husband, really—and I… we’re planning to try. That’s all you need to know. Less chatter, more action, please. It's August 2nd, 2025, and time is of the essence.
DOCTOR: Understood. Efficiency. Absolutely. Alright, let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Once. A long time ago. It was… uncomplicated. No issues. Standard delivery. Though frankly, the whole experience was rather… disappointing. It’s not relevant. The point is, I can get pregnant. I just don't want to waste time with complications this time. Do you have my chart yet, or am I expected to recite my life story?
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Here we are. Angelle Shteynberg. It says here you had one previous delivery in… 1998?
PATIENT: Precisely. 1998. You do have it. Good. Now, are we going to discuss preventative measures, or are you simply going to confirm dates? I need to know what tests you’ll be doing to ensure a smooth pregnancy. And how long it will take. I have engagements, you know. This isn’t a social call.
DOCTOR: Right, preventative measures. We'll want to do a thorough check-up. Let's start with some blood work. That will tell us your blood type, check for any infections, and assess your hormone levels. We'll also do a physical exam, of course. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more, but that’s beside the point. Just… get to the tests. And make them quick. I don’t have all day. Are these tests covered by Medicare, I presume? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, the standard tests are covered by Medicare. We'll just need to get an order processed. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your current health… are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Good grief. Medications? Are you implying I'm frail? No. Absolutely none. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals. It’s a disgusting habit, frankly. Just… get it over with. I want a list of these tests, Doctor. And a timeframe. I need to plan accordingly. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? And don't tell me to "relax".
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Good to know. As for preparation… for the blood work, you'll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand – no food or drinks except water. We’ll schedule that for tomorrow morning. And, just for the record, I wasn't implying anything about you being frail. It’s standard procedure. Now, can you tell me about any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Really? My mother lived to ninety, thank you very much. And my father… well, he smoked too much, but that’s hardly relevant. No hereditary illnesses to speak of. No heart conditions, no diabetes, no cancers. A perfectly healthy lineage. Honestly, Doctor, I’m wasting my time here. Just… schedule the blood work. First thing tomorrow. And make sure it’s fast. I have… arrangements to make. Is that understood? .
DOCTOR: Yes, understood. First thing tomorrow morning. We'll get that scheduled right away. Alright, then. We'll see you tomorrow. Please come in fasting. And if anything changes—if you experience any unusual symptoms—don't hesitate to call the clinic. .
