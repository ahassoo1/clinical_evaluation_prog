DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes, you see. Not all the time. Just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, the flushing. And how long has this been happening, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around February, I think. Yes, February. My wife… she noticed it first. She’s… not here anymore, you see. But she said it looked like I was getting… embarrassed. But I wasn’t! Just… red.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be very difficult. So, this flushing started around February. Does it happen at specific times of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… quiet now. Too quiet. The flushing… no, not really a time. And not after doing anything special. Sometimes when I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes… just happens when I'm sitting, watching the news. Or talking to someone. It's… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be somewhat unpredictable, and sometimes related to spicy food, but not always. And it can happen even when you’re just relaxing. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Better? Hmm… usually, it just… goes away on its own. After a few minutes. Maybe ten minutes, sometimes. Cool air helps a little, I think. Standing in front of the fan… that makes it feel… less hot. But it’s not like a heat rash, you understand? It’s… more a color. A red color.
DOCTOR: Alright, it resolves on its own within about ten minutes, and cool air seems to provide some relief. It’s primarily a redness, not necessarily accompanied by a rash or feeling hot to the touch. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms when this flushing happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not very fast, just… noticeable. And… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. But not fall-down dizzy, you know? Just… light-headed. That doesn't happen every time, though. Sometimes just the red face.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally with the flushing you experience a faster heartbeat and lightheadedness. Not every time, but it does happen. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… no, not really. I used to have… high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was fine. Years ago. And… nothing else. I try to eat healthy. Walk a little every day. Nothing serious. I don't take any pills, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure that’s now under control, and otherwise generally healthy. No medications currently. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat peanuts, shellfish… everything. I remember when I was a boy, my mother… she always made sure I didn't eat anything strange. But I haven’t had a problem with food or anything else. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Mr. Withycombe, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will help me to better understand what might be going on.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Just let me know if I need to… do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart rate is 78, which is normal. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. I’m also going to take a quick look at your skin. Right now, your skin looks normal. No rash or visible irritation. However, it's difficult to assess the flushing when you're not currently experiencing it. Based on what you’ve told me and this initial exam, it could be a few different things. We need to consider things like rosacea, certain medications – though you’re not currently taking any – and less common possibilities.
PATIENT: Rosacea? What is that, Doctor? Is that… serious? And what else could it be? It's just… worrying, you see. Especially since my wife… she always knew when something was wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe, and it’s perfectly normal to feel worried. Losing your wife must make things even more difficult. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pus-filled bumps on the face. It's usually chronic, meaning it can come and go, but it’s generally not serious, although it can be uncomfortable and affect your self-esteem. There are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. Other possibilities include things like a reaction to something you've eaten – even if it's not an allergy, some foods can trigger flushing – or, less commonly, certain underlying medical conditions. Because of the episodes of dizziness and heart palpitations, we should rule out anything that might affect your heart rhythm. I’d like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. An EKG to check your heart, and some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it will help find out what's wrong, then yes. An EKG and blood work. I trust your judgment. What do I need to do? And… how long will it take? I have a little… appointment to get my taxes done next week.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you agree. For the EKG, we can do that right here in the office. It’s quick and painless – we just put some stickers on your chest and arms. It should only take about 10-15 minutes. The blood work will require a visit to the lab down the hall. They'll need a sample of your blood. The lab can give you specific instructions about fasting if necessary, but I’ll write a request that should cover everything. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. So, we should have them by early next week, well before your tax appointment. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Here's the lab order. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to schedule the blood work?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very helpful. Let me see… "Metro Labs, 14 Elm Street." Yes, I think I know where that is. I usually get my flu shot there. And… it says I don’t need to fast? That’s good. I always get hungry. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… I hope it's nothing serious. And thank you again, Doctor. For being so… patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if anything changes before your follow-up appointment. For now, just try to monitor your symptoms and write down if anything seems to trigger the flushing. That information can be helpful when we discuss the results. I'll see you next week then.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will do that. I’ll write everything down. And… thank you. Have a good day.
