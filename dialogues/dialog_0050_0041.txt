DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my legs, mostly. They’re just getting weaker, you see. It’s been happening slowly, but now it’s getting harder to… to do things.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in the legs. And you say this has been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not sudden, not a fall or anything. Just… little by little. Harder to get up from the chair, you know? Walking feels… heavier. It’s been maybe six months now, I think? Hard to say exactly, time goes fast when you’re older.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And has this weakness been primarily in both legs, or is it more pronounced on one side?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question, Doctor. I think… both legs feel it, but maybe the left one is a little worse. Not much, though. It’s hard for me to tell for sure. Sometimes I just feel clumsy, you know? Like I might stumble.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness, alright. And have you experienced any pain associated with this weakness, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain at all. That’s what’s so strange about it. It's not like a hurt or anything. Just… less power, I guess. It’s just tiring to walk, even short distances. Makes me worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astores. A lack of pain certainly doesn’t make it any less worrisome. Now, let’s go through a little more detail. Have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little. I don’t fall often, thankfully. But I feel like I need to hold onto things more. The furniture, sometimes the wall. My wife, she worries about me too. She says I sway a little when I stand still. I don’t always notice it myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's useful information. And have you observed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not all the time, but… yes. Mostly in my feet, I think. Like pins and needles, but not real bad. It comes and goes. Hard to describe. It’s like they’re asleep, then wake up. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Astores, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent numbness and tingling. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… I have my blood pressure, it’s okay mostly, but the doctor keeps an eye on it. And… oh. Years ago, another doctor told me I had… something with the nerves. Multiple… something? I don't remember exactly what he called it. It was a long time ago, and I haven't had trouble with it until now. I think it was something that would just… be there, you know? He said I shouldn't worry too much.
DOCTOR: "Multiple something…" Do you recall approximately when this diagnosis was made, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it was… must have been twenty years ago, maybe more. I was living in Honolulu then. The doctor did some tests… poked and prodded, you know? Said it was something I'd have to live with, but it shouldn’t affect my life too much. I don't remember the name of it though, Doctor. I’m sorry. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Astores. We can often look these things up. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than anything for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. One in the morning, one at night. And sometimes a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s not every day, just when it’s really bothering me. It’s a small, white pill… I can’t remember the name of that either, sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife says I eat anything, even things I shouldn't! She keeps me in line, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Astores, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, okay? I’m an old man, so things don’t work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. We’ll take it slow. Please, if you could sit here, and we’ll start with your reflexes. Alright, let’s start with the knee reflexes. …Good. Now the ankle reflexes. …A little diminished on the left side. Now, can you please point your toes and flex your feet against my resistance?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here we go… It’s a little harder than it used to be, you see? It feels… weaker, like my muscles aren’t listening properly. Not painful, just… less power.
DOCTOR: Yes, I observe that, Mr. Astores. Now, can you close your eyes, and tell me where I am touching your legs and feet?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Hmm… there?… Yes, on my shin. And… there?… That’s my foot, I think. Yes, just below my ankle. It feels… a little different on this side. Not numb, exactly, but… muted. Like someone turned the volume down a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I’d like to check your balance. If you could stand up slowly, please, and try to balance for a moment without holding onto anything. I’ll be right here to steady you if needed.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Woah… there we go. It's a little wobbly, you see? I don’t like standing still like this. Makes me feel… unsteady. My wife says I sway when I’m just standing in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that, Mr. Astores. And that's helpful information. Alright, please, have a seat. Based on what you've told me, and the findings of the examination, the most likely explanation for your symptoms is a progression of peripheral neuropathy. Given your history of nerve issues twenty years ago, it's likely this condition is re-emerging or worsening. The diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and sensory changes, combined with the balance issues, are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood tests. We'll check your vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and glucose levels, as deficiencies or imbalances can sometimes mimic neuropathy. I’d also like to order an electromyography and nerve conduction study to assess the function of the nerves in your legs and feet more precisely. This will help us determine the extent of the nerve damage and guide treatment. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… well, it sounds complicated, Doctor. But if it will help figure out what's going on, then yes, that's reasonable. What does this… EMG and nerve study… involve? And will the blood tests be painful? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will involve a standard blood draw, yes. A small prick, a little discomfort, but usually very brief. I understand you dislike needles, so the phlebotomist will be as gentle as possible. Now, the EMG and nerve conduction study is a bit more involved, but not overly painful. It involves placing small electrodes on the skin of your legs and feet to measure the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. You may feel some mild tingling or discomfort during the test, similar to a brief muscle twitch. It’s not like a shot, it doesn't penetrate the skin. It takes about an hour or so. The technician will explain everything thoroughly before the test, and you can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist who specializes in peripheral neuropathy. They will schedule the EMG and nerve conduction study, and interpret the results. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue with your usual activities, but avoid anything that exacerbates your symptoms. We'll re-evaluate once we have the results of the tests and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… okay. A neurologist, you say? I haven’t seen one of those before. And the tests sound… not too bad, I guess. As long as it’s not too painful. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not dismissing my worries. It’s just… hard getting older, you know? Things just… stop working.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Astores. It is hard getting older. And you are right to take your concerns seriously. We’re here to help you manage these changes and maintain the best possible quality of life. I will fax a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, including the list of medications you take, the referral information, and the reasons for ordering the tests. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you again for your time and your patience. It’s a relief to finally have some answers, even if they’re not easy ones. I’ll call Dr. Reed’s office when I get home. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. Please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to discussing the results of your tests with you once they are available.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
