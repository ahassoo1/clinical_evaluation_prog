DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up for a team tryout. Gotta make sure I’m still good to go, you know? Don't want any surprises when I start running around.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A pre-participation physical. Very sensible. It's good you're being proactive. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit more about this team tryout?
PATIENT: It's… a kind of… long-distance running team. Not professional, exactly. More like a serious hobby group, but we compete sometimes. Mostly just local stuff. It's a new team, so they want everyone checked out before we really get going. I'm… well, I’m a bit older than most of the others, so I figure a good look-over is a good idea.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. Age is a factor, and it's always best to be thorough. Now, Mr. Kingan, have you been experiencing any pain recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… consistently. My knees sometimes feel a little stiff after a long run, but that's… old age, I guess. Nothing that stops me, though. And my back… it aches a bit if I don't stretch properly. But I always stretch. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stiffness in the knees and occasional back ache… I see. And when you say "occasional", how often would you say this back pain occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… once or twice a month? If I really push myself too hard on a run. Or if I forget to warm up properly. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Goes away after a bit of walking around. I wouldn’t even bother mentioning it, honestly, if you hadn’t asked.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Kingan. Even seemingly minor discomfort can be important. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I know of… I’ve never really been to the doctor much. Just the usual colds and flu. Had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but that’s it. Never been hospitalized or anything like that. Nothing serious, anyway. I try to stay healthy. Eat reasonably well, get enough sleep... you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. All original parts, as they say. I've been lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing that needed a doctor's attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had… some heart trouble when she got older. High blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had arthritis in his hands. Pretty bad towards the end. Other than that… not that I know of. We don’t really talk about that stuff much. It’s… a bit of a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I try to get most of what I need from my food. Don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. It makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky that way, too. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I’m kinda eager to get this over with so I can get back to training.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Mr. Kingan. Just a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss our findings. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Let's just get it over with then. The sooner the better, right? What will you be doing exactly? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, examining your joints, and briefly assessing your reflexes and range of motion. It shouldn't take long. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… try not to squeeze too hard, okay? My veins aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kingan. I'll be as gentle as possible. … 140 over 85. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart… Take a deep breath for me. … Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's faint, but worth noting. … Lungs are clear. Now, can you please rotate your shoulders for me?
PATIENT: There… a little stiff. Like I said. Getting old, you know? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A limited range of motion, and some mild discomfort, as you mentioned. Now, can you bend over and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Ugh… can’t quite reach anymore. My back’s protesting. Getting old is not for the faint of heart, Doctor. Seriously. Is that enough? I don’t think I can go any further without… well, without needing a chiropractor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kingan. No need to push yourself. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. … Patellar reflex is present, but a little diminished. And now the other side… … also diminished. Alright, Mr. Kingan. That's all for the physical exam. I’ll need a few minutes to review my findings.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So… what does it all mean? Am I still good to go for this team tryout? That's the important part, right? I don't need a full medical report, just a quick "yes" or "no" will do. I’ve got training to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. While you are generally in stable condition, I do have a few concerns. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your heart murmur, although faint, requires further investigation, and your reflexes are diminished. Your limited range of motion in your shoulders and your back discomfort also need to be addressed. Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't try out for the team, but I strongly recommend you see a cardiologist to evaluate the murmur. Also, physical therapy could be beneficial for your shoulder and back. Given your insurance status, I can provide you with resources for low-cost cardiac evaluations and physical therapy options in the area. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… and physical therapy… Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping for a clean bill of health. I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t about to collapse on the track. Resources… low-cost… Yeah, okay. I mean, I don’t exactly have a pile of money lying around. Give me whatever you’ve got. But… look, can I just try out first? Maybe it’s nothing. Maybe I’m just getting old and paranoid. I don’t want to waste time and money on tests if I don’t even make the team. Is that a terrible idea?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration and desire to proceed with the tryout. However, ignoring these findings could potentially be harmful. A cardiovascular event, while not necessarily imminent, is a risk we need to consider. While I cannot officially clear you for strenuous activity without further evaluation, I respect your autonomy as a patient. If you choose to proceed with the tryout, I strongly advise you to start slowly, listen to your body, and stop immediately if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or unusual fatigue. I will provide you with a list of local resources for cardiac evaluation and physical therapy, along with some warning signs to watch out for. I will also document your decision in your chart. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. Document it. List of resources. Warning signs. I get it. You've covered your bases. I'll… I'll try to be careful. And I'll think about the cardiologist, okay? Maybe after the tryout. If I even make it. Look, can we just get this paperwork sorted so I can get going? I really appreciate you not just saying "no" outright, Doctor. That’s… more than I expected. Let's just get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. I'm happy to provide you with the resources. I'll print out the list of local cardiac evaluations and physical therapy options, along with the warning signs to watch out for. I will also document our conversation and your decision in your chart. … Here you go. Please read through this carefully. If you experience any of those symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
