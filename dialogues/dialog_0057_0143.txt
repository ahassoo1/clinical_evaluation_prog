DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's a bit… complicated. A friend suggested I come. Something about… getting ready for a baby? I don't really… remember all the details. I just know it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like you might be preparing for a new addition to the family, which is wonderful! To help me understand what’s going on and what your friend meant, could you tell me a little more about why you think you’re preparing for a baby?
PATIENT: Preparing… yes. Well, my… a woman I know, she thinks it would be good. She’s younger, much younger. We… we’ve been seeing each other. And she wants… a family. I haven’t really… thought about it much before. It all happened quickly. Is that… enough information? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. You're doing just fine. It sounds like things have been developing recently, and it's completely understandable to feel a little unsure. It’s good you’re coming in to discuss this. So, to clarify, you and this woman are in a relationship, and she is interested in starting a family. And you’re here today to discuss what that means for you and to ensure you’re both prepared, medically speaking?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds right. Medically prepared. I don't even know what that means. I’m… not the healthiest person, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. I mostly just try to ignore things. Is it… bad that I haven’t been?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to fall behind on regular check-ups, Mr. Verrall. Life gets busy, and sometimes it's easier to put these things off. But it's good you’re addressing it now. Being prepared medically is important, especially if you're considering starting a family. It helps us ensure both you and your partner are as healthy as possible. To get a better understanding of your current health, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That’s… a lot of years ago. I think I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football. And… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, chickenpox… Nothing serious. As an adult… I don’t really remember much. I worked a lot, travelling for my job. Sales, you know? Always on the road. Didn’t have time for doctors. I think I had a bad back once, but I just took some pills. Do you… need to know about specific pills? I don't recall the names.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child and typical childhood illnesses. And some back pain as an adult that you treated with over-the-counter medication. That's helpful. Do you remember what kind of over-the-counter medication you took for your back pain?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… hmm. It was… blue. The packaging was blue, I think. And… white writing? It was something you could buy at any shop, you know, not a prescription. It was for pain, and… maybe inflammation? I really can’t remember. It helped a little, but not much. I mostly just tried to avoid lifting heavy things. I was a Sales Engineer, so I didn’t do too much heavy lifting, mostly talking.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blue and white packaging for pain relief. It’s alright if you don’t recall the specific name, Mr. Verrall. We can sometimes piece things together. Now, besides the back pain, have you experienced any other significant health issues as an adult?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. Well, I get tired easily. I put that down to the travelling, to be honest. All the flights, different time zones… It just wears you down. And… sometimes my stomach bothers me. Not all the time, but after I eat certain things. Spicy food usually. I don’t really eat much spicy food anymore, because of that. Oh, and I have a bit of trouble sleeping. I just… lie there sometimes, for hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, stomach upset after spicy foods, and difficulty sleeping. Those are all things we can explore further. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat almost anything, really. Never had any problems. I think I had a rash once, when I was a child, but my mother said it was just from nettles. I don't think it was an allergy. I've never been to a hospital for an allergy test, or anything like that. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Or, I thought I was.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you’ve never been formally diagnosed with any allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not really. I haven’t needed anything. Sometimes I take… something for my stomach. Just a little tablet, you can buy it anywhere. For indigestion, you know? But it's not regular. Only if I eat something bad. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D tablet in the winter. My friend said I should. She’s very health-conscious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an as-needed indigestion tablet and Vitamin D in the winter. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult one. My father… he had problems with his heart, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t really remember much. My mother… she lived to a good old age, but she had… arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hands. And… my brother, he had high blood pressure, I think. But I’m not really sure. We weren’t very close, so we didn’t talk much about health.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart problems in your father, arthritis in your mother, and high blood pressure in your brother. That gives us something to work with. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other basic checks. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds alright. As long as it’s not too… invasive. I get a bit nervous, you see. I haven't been examined in… well, a very long time. But I understand it's important, if we’re thinking about… all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. It will be nothing too invasive, I assure you. Just a routine check. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please feel free to stop me at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. If you could just sit here for me, and we'll get started. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear some slightly diminished breath sounds, especially in the lower lobes of your lungs. It could be due to a number of things. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper right quadrant. Your reflexes are normal. I’m going to take your temperature and pulse now. Your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your pulse is 78 beats per minute. Overall, the exam shows some areas of concern that we need to investigate further. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your breath sounds are diminished, and you have some tenderness in your upper abdomen. We’ll need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes… blood work sounds… sensible. If you think it's needed. It all feels a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. But I want to do what’s right. For… everyone. What kind of blood work? Will it be painful? I don’t like needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verrall. It can be a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The blood work is fairly routine. We'll be checking your complete blood count, your cholesterol levels, your kidney and liver function, and your blood sugar. It’ll give us a good baseline to work with. As for the needle, it’s a quick pinch, and most people find it’s not too bad. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. We can also use a numbing cream if you’re particularly anxious. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. You’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw, so ideally, we’d schedule it for tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, I think so. I can… try to not eat. Eight hours. That’s… a long time. Will I feel weak? I get a bit… shaky if I don’t eat. And… the results? How long will it take to get them? I'm worried it will be something… bad.
DOCTOR: We can definitely work with that, Mr. Verrall. And yes, eight hours can feel long, but it’s manageable. You can drink water during the fast, just avoid any food or sugary drinks. If you’re concerned about feeling weak or shaky, we can schedule the appointment for a little later in the morning, to give you more time. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to get them back to us. Once we have them, we’ll review them together and discuss any necessary next steps. It’s important to remember that these tests are just a snapshot in time, and we’ll interpret them in the context of your overall health. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly, so you’re fully informed. I've ordered the blood work and scheduled you for a draw tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. You can have water but nothing to eat or drink after midnight. Now, while we're waiting for those results, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I am. As I… mentioned. With the woman. Not… regularly. But yes. Is that… important? It feels… personal. I don’t understand why you need to know that.
DOCTOR: It is personal, Mr. Verrall, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. I ask because, given the potential for starting a family, it’s important to consider screening for sexually transmitted infections, or STIs. These can sometimes be asymptomatic, meaning you might not experience any noticeable symptoms, but they can have implications for both your health and the potential health of a developing baby. It’s a routine part of preventative care when someone is considering parenthood. We can discuss testing options if you’re comfortable, or you can decline, of course. It’s entirely your decision. We can also discuss safe sex practices, regardless of whether you choose to be tested. Would you like me to explain the testing options?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. That… makes sense. I hadn't thought of that. Yes, please. Explain the testing options. It’s better to be safe, I suppose. I don’t want to… cause any problems. And I don't know much about… safe sex. She’s younger, she probably knows more about it than I do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's wise to be informed, and it’s commendable that you’re taking this seriously. We typically recommend a panel of tests that includes screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B. These tests can be done with a simple urine sample or a blood draw, and they're highly accurate. We can also discuss preventative measures, such as using condoms consistently. They're a very effective way to reduce the risk of STIs, as well as preventing unwanted pregnancies. It’s important to have an open conversation with your partner about safe sex practices and get tested together. I'm going to print out a handout that summarizes the common STIs, their symptoms, and the importance of testing. It also includes information on safe sex practices. We can schedule a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the blood work results and any other concerns you might have. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A handout would be helpful. And a follow-up appointment. It’s a lot to take in, but… I appreciate you explaining everything. And… she's very important to me, so I want to do everything right. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Unless… is there anything else I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I’m glad I could help. Right now, focusing on getting the blood work done and reviewing the handout is a good first step. We can address any other concerns during the follow-up appointment. Considering your slightly elevated blood pressure, it would be good to start incorporating some healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet. Even small changes can make a big difference. I’ll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Verrall.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Sieh. You too. .
