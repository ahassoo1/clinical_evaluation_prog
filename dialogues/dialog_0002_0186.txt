DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team. Trying out, you see. Need to make sure I’m good to go. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good planning! A pre-participation physical. Excellent. To get started, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for?
PATIENT: It’s… a wrestling team. Older guys, mostly. Not professional or anything, just… competitive. We wrestle around the state, small tournaments. Keeps an old man like me busy. Don't want to pull a muscle, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Wrestling can be pretty demanding, even at a competitive amateur level. And how often do you practice and compete currently?
PATIENT: Uh… practice is twice a week. And then… competitions, maybe once a month, sometimes not even that. It depends on who’s organizing things. Honestly, it’s pretty casual. We mostly just do it for fun and to stay in shape. Though, some of those guys are serious about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, twice a week practice and occasional monthly competitions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, have you had any injuries in the past – anything related to wrestling or otherwise?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, twisted my knee pretty bad during a match. Needed some physical therapy for that. That was… oh, maybe fifteen years ago? Nothing major since then, just the usual aches and pains of getting older. A sore back here and there, you know? Nothing that’s kept me from training.
DOCTOR: Okay, a knee twist fifteen years ago requiring physical therapy. And some occasional back soreness. Do you recall where in your knee you twisted it, and did you ever get any imaging done – like an X-ray or MRI – at the time?
PATIENT: Right, it was… the inside of the knee. Left knee. And yeah, they did an X-ray. I think that’s all they did, honestly. They said it wasn’t broken, just a sprain. Didn't need surgery or anything. I just did a lot of exercises they showed me. It healed up fine. Never bothered me much after that.
DOCTOR: Good to know it healed well. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any other significant medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I eat alright, try to stay active, you know? Family history is… pretty normal, as far as I know. No real big health concerns on either side. I get a bit winded sometimes when I run, but I figured that’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. Just a multivitamin sometimes. But I haven’t taken one in… well, a while, actually. I try to get everything I need from my food. Is this going to take long? I have some things I need to get done this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, we're almost through the initial questions. Just a few more to get a good baseline. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I can eat pretty much anything. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, ever. Seriously. Getting a little impatient, to be honest. Just want to know if I’m good to wrestle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s great. No known allergies. Alright, Lamark, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, joints, and overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner we’re done, the better. Just tell me if I need to worry about anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit here for me, please. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths… like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly like that. Okay… I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs. And your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the exertion of just getting here. Could you describe any cough or shortness of breath you've been experiencing recently?
PATIENT: Uh… well, I do get a little breathless when I climb stairs. And sometimes, especially in the mornings, I have a bit of a cough. Nothing too bad, just a tickle in my throat. Thought it was just… old age. Never really bothered me enough to see a doctor, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's check your knees. You mentioned twisting your knee years ago. Any pain or stiffness in either knee currently?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. A little creaky, maybe, when I get out of bed. But no sharp pain or anything. I can bend them pretty good, I think. There, see? Not bad for an old man. Can we hurry this up a bit? I’m starting to feel a bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'm noticing a little bit of tenderness here on the inside of your left knee. And a slight range of motion limitation when bending. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. I really need to get going soon. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. Strength seems good in your arms. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, and your pulse is 88. Lamark, given your mild wheezing, slightly limited knee range of motion, and elevated blood pressure, I think it's important to do a few more tests before you start wrestling.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I just need to know if I'm good to go! I don't have time for a lot of tests. This is getting ridiculous. Is it something serious? Tell me straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I'll be as straightforward as possible. It's not necessarily serious, but we need more information to be safe. I recommend a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. Given your age and the physical demands of wrestling, we need to make sure everything is okay before you put yourself at risk. Would you be open to getting those tests done?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. But can we do it quickly? I don't want to waste a whole day at the clinic. And who pays for all this? I don't have insurance, you know. This is just great. Just what I needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. We can try to get the tests done as quickly as possible. I'll write you a referral to the lab and radiology center. As for the cost, I know not having insurance can be difficult. Let me see what options we have for reduced fees or payment plans. There's a program through the county that offers discounted lab work for uninsured patients. I'll give you the information. The radiology center also sometimes offers a cash discount. I also want to be upfront: given your blood pressure, even if the tests come back normal, I might recommend starting some medication to manage it. It’s important for your long-term health. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Medication? Now you're talking. This is getting worse and worse. Fine. I'll… I'll think about it. But I'm not promising anything. Can I at least get a note saying I tried to get checked out before I go wrestle? Just in case something happens? I really just want to wrestle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Here's a note stating you had a pre-participation physical examination on August 2, 2025, and are awaiting results of further testing. It's important to remember this doesn't clear you for participation, it simply documents that you sought medical evaluation. And I strongly recommend postponing wrestling until we have the test results and can discuss a plan. Here's some information about local urgent care and the emergency room, just in case. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but your safety is my priority. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s… everything. Just… I’ll try to get the tests done. Thanks, I guess.
