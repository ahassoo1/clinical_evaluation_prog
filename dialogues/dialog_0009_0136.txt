DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I keep… belching. A lot. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, belching, or excessive burping, you said. And you’re not sure what’s causing it. I understand it can be quite bothersome, and even embarrassing. Let’s try to get a little more information. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? Not sure exactly. It wasn't bad at first, just a little here and there. But it’s getting worse now, especially after I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month ago, starting gradually and now worsening, particularly after meals. That's helpful. Could you describe what the belching feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s just… normal belches, I guess. But… a lot of them. Sometimes it feels like there's air stuck in my chest, and I need to get it out. It doesn't hurt, just… uncomfortable and loud. Sometimes my stomach feels… full, even when I haven't eaten much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so normal-feeling burps, but frequent, with a sensation of trapped air and sometimes a feeling of fullness. No pain, which is good to know. Now, when you eat, what types of foods do you usually have?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I work in a factory, so usually I bring a lunch box. Sandwiches, rice and beans… sometimes a little bit of chicken. Not much, really. I try to eat healthy. And I drink a lot of water. Sometimes soda… but not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, sandwiches, rice and beans, some chicken, water mostly, occasional soda. I see. Do you notice any specific foods that seem to trigger the belching more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. I think maybe the beans. They give me a lot of… gas. And sometimes, if I eat too fast, it's worse. But it’s hard to tell, really. It happens even when I try to eat slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, beans seem to be a potential trigger, and eating quickly may also contribute, but it still happens even with slow eating. Now, I’d like to ask a little bit more generally. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Um… not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours, so… I don’t know if that's related. No stomach pain, no heartburn, nothing like that. Just the belching and feeling a little… puffed up, maybe, after I eat. Like my stomach is too full of air.
DOCTOR: Okay, no stomach pain, no heartburn, just the belching and a feeling of fullness or puffiness. That's good to know. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I stay about the same. I try to eat healthy, like I said. I haven’t lost or gained any weight that I know of. I… I don't weigh myself often.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, before we move on to a brief examination, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Just the belching! It's really the only problem I have, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no allergies. Just the belching. Thank you for that information, Lucia. It’s very helpful. Now, would you mind if I listened to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and I'll do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, that's okay. Go ahead, Doctor. I want to find out what’s wrong, so… whatever you need to do. It's just belching, but it’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your abdomen in a few different spots. It might feel a little cool. Just breathe normally. Okay, your bowel sounds are present and normal, which is good. I don’t hear anything unusual. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen—feel it—to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels painful. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It's… okay. Not painful. A little bit uncomfortable, but not painful, like when you push on it. Just… normal. Maybe a little gassy, but… I always feel a little gassy after I eat, so I don’t think that’s anything new. It doesn’t hurt, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tenderness, no masses. You’re right, a little bit of fullness, but nothing acutely concerning. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found on the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to excessive gas, likely aerophagia—swallowing too much air. This can be caused by eating too quickly, carbonated beverages, or even certain foods. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order a couple of simple tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation or infection. And then a stool test to rule out any bacterial imbalances. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Um… okay. If you think it’s a good idea. I want to know what's wrong, so… yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. What do I need to do for the tests? It’s okay if it involves… you know… a sample. I just want this belching to stop. It's embarrassing!
DOCTOR: I understand, and I apologize for any embarrassment. The stool test will involve collecting a small sample—about a walnut-sized amount—in a container we'll provide. We’ll give you clear instructions on how to do that at the front desk. The CBC will just require a small blood draw. In the meantime, let's talk about some things you can try at home. Slow down when you eat. Avoid carbonated beverages. Try to identify if there are any specific foods that trigger your symptoms, and limit those. If you feel bloated, gentle exercise, like walking, can help. Over-the-counter simethicone, like Gas-X, can also help to relieve gas. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay… slow down eating, no soda, see what foods bother me… walk and those Gas-X… I think I understand. Um… what if it doesn't get better? How long should I try this before I… come back? And… does this mean something serious is wrong? I don’t have a lot of money, so… I’m worried about expensive tests if it’s something bad.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Lucia, and I understand your financial worries completely. It’s good you asked. Let's start with the timeframe. I'd like you to try these measures consistently for two weeks. If you don't notice any significant improvement after two weeks, then please schedule a follow-up appointment with me. As for whether it's something serious, it's unlikely to be something serious at this point, given your symptoms and the physical examination. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, especially if the symptoms persist. The CBC and stool tests will help us do that. If you develop any new symptoms—like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or blood in your stool—please contact the clinic immediately, even before your follow-up appointment. Regarding the cost of further testing, we can discuss options for financial assistance if needed. We also have a social worker on staff who can help you navigate available resources. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… that's really helpful. Two weeks. If it gets worse, or something new happens, I call. And we can talk about money if I need more tests. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I was worried it was something really bad. I will try those things, and I will come back if it doesn't get better. And I will call if something new happens. I feel a little better now, just knowing what to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could reassure you, and you're absolutely right to be proactive about your health. I understand it can be worrying, but we’re going to take it one step at a time. I’ll have the front desk staff give you the lab requisition forms and instructions for the stool collection. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, even if they seem small. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Petrimoulx. You've been very kind. I will see what happens over the next two weeks and I will come back if I need to. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. I wish you the best, and I hope you feel better soon. You have a good day too, and please don't hesitate to reach out.
