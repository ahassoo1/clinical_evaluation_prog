DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Um, honestly? A friend suggested I come talk about… preventative stuff. About staying healthy, you know? She mentioned something about a pill you can take… to avoid getting sick. I don't even know the name of it, but that’s why I’m here. I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, preventative stuff… that's good thinking. And a pill to avoid getting sick... that sounds like we might be talking about some different options. There are several things we can discuss. Just to be clear, when you say "avoid getting sick," are you thinking about things like the flu, pneumonia, or something else specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not the flu. Something… different. She was talking about, well, things you get from… being close to people. Things that are… spread that way. I’m not even sure I should say it out loud. It's about… protection, I guess. She said this pill helps with that. I hope that makes sense. I’m a bit embarrassed talking about it, truthfully.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Helaina. No need to be embarrassed at all. You're doing the right thing by asking. It sounds like you're referring to sexually transmitted infections, or STIs. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a medication that can help prevent HIV, which is one type of STI. Is that what your friend was talking about?
PATIENT: Yes! PrEP, that’s it! That's what she called it. That’s exactly what she was talking about. She said it's… a way to stay safe, even if… things aren't perfect. And she said you could talk to a doctor about it. So… yeah. That’s why I’m here. Is it… hard to get? I have Medicare, so I’m not sure what that covers.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. PrEP is a very effective option. Let me just pull up your information here… Alright, Helaina Trefren, age 55, Medicare coverage. Okay, that’s helpful. Medicare does cover PrEP, thankfully, but there can be some requirements, like regular check-ups and STI testing. We'd need to do some bloodwork to make sure you're a good candidate and that it's safe for you to start. Do you have any allergies or medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, good, that’s a relief about Medicare! I always worry about that. Um… allergies? Not really. Maybe a little sniffly with cats, but that's it. Medical conditions… I have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I take lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. That's about it, honestly. Nothing major, I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with lisinopril, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – ten years ago. That's good to know. We’ll want to check your kidney function before starting PrEP, just to be sure the lisinopril isn’t interfering. And we’ll do a full STI screening, of course. Have you had any recent STI testing?
PATIENT: Um… no, not recently. It's been… a long time. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t really been with anyone in quite a while. It's… complicated. That’s why my friend suggested this. Just to be safe, you know? I don’t even know where to start with all of this. I feel a bit silly even talking about it.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this, and it’s completely normal to feel a little overwhelmed. Many people come in with similar questions, and it’s my job to help you feel comfortable and informed. Since it’s been a while, we’ll definitely want to get a baseline STI screening. That includes blood tests and a urine sample. We’ll also check your kidney function, like I mentioned, to make sure PrEP is safe for you. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Okay, I can do that. Blood tests and a urine sample. Whatever you think is necessary. I just… I want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. And that I’m being safe. Where do we do those tests? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do everything right here at the clinic. We have a lab just down the hall. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in and draw your blood and collect your urine sample. She’ll explain everything to you. While she’s doing that, I’ll review your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Also, could you tell me a little bit about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. That's easy enough, at least. As for… that? Well. It's… been a while, like I said. I was married for thirty years, but my husband passed away five years ago. Since then… not much. A few dates, nothing serious. I’m not very… active, if you know what I mean. And I definitely don't… I haven't had unprotected sex. Ever. I just want to be prepared, you know? If… something happens. It's hard to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Helaina. Thank you for sharing that with me. It's good to know. Your history helps me understand your risk factors better. And it's excellent that you've always practiced safe sex. Given your history, PrEP could be a very good option for you, and we can discuss that further once we have the results of your tests. I'm going to call Maria in now to get things started. She’ll explain the process, and please don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you might have. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Okay. Let's just get it over with. I’m ready for Maria, then. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. It’s easier talking about this than I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. And you're right, sometimes it’s just good to get it out in the open. I'll just let Maria know to expect you. She'll be right in. Maria?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. I'll just… sit here, then? Waiting for Maria.
DOCTOR: Yes, just sit comfortably. She shouldn't be long. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. .
PATIENT: .
