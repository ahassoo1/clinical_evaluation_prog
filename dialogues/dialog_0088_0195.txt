DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s…well, it’s not a real problem, you understand. More of a…a formality, really. My daughter, she insisted I come. Says I need a little…encouragement. A card, she said. From a doctor. Can you believe it? A get-well card when I’m perfectly fine!
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to be so attentive to your health. Even if you feel perfectly well, a quick check-up can be helpful. It’s a good opportunity to review things. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Honestly, just…old. You know? Everything aches a little more each year. But that’s just…life, isn’t it? I get up, I do my work – little assembly things at the factory – I cook for my husband. Nothing wrong, exactly. It's not like I'm laid up in bed! My daughter just worries too much. She thinks a doctor’s note will somehow…magically fix things.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re very active and independent, which is wonderful. And it’s common for things to ache a bit more as we get older – that’s perfectly normal. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a bit more about the aches?
PATIENT: Thorough, is it? Well, alright. It’s mostly my hands and wrists, you see. From the assembly work. Small parts, repetitive motions. And my lower back, sometimes, after I've been on my feet all day. It’s not…sharp pain, it’s more of a…dull ache. Like everything is just…tired. And, honestly, sometimes my knees bother me a bit going up the stairs. But like I said, I'm old. What do you expect?
DOCTOR: Okay, hands, wrists, lower back, and knees. Dull aches, worse with activity. And you mentioned the assembly work. Have you noticed these aches getting progressively worse, or have they been fairly consistent over time?
PATIENT: Consistent. Yes, that’s a good word. They haven't suddenly gotten worse, no. They’ve been…there. For years. A little better some days, a little worse on others, depending on how much I’ve done. It's not like it started all of a sudden and I can't do anything. I still manage everything, thank you very much. My daughter…she just overreacts.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been managing this for quite some time. Alright. Now, aside from the aches, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, perhaps. But that could just be the heat, you know? It’s been awfully warm. And maybe my memory isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be. But who remembers everything perfectly when you’re my age? I wouldn’t call those changes, really. Just…normal aging.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue and some memory concerns. And you attribute those to the heat and age, which is reasonable. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is fine. Always have been a good eater, me. And my weight…well, it stays pretty much the same. Maybe a pound or two up or down, depending on the month, but nothing drastic. I like to cook, you see, so I always make sure my husband and I are well-fed. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost my appetite at all.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to hear. Now, do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed in the past, like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. The doctor, years ago, said my blood pressure was a little high, once. But he put me on a little pill for it, and it went right down. Haven’t needed it in years, though. And…no, I don’t think I have any…arthritis or anything like that. I've been lucky, really. My husband, he’s had all sorts of problems, but I’ve always been quite healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but currently well-managed without medication. And no other diagnosed medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And…hospitalized? Oh, let me think. When I had my children, of course. That was many years ago. But other than that, no. I’ve always prided myself on staying out of the hospital. I believe in fresh air and hard work, not doctors and medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not a single pill. I don’t like taking things if I don’t absolutely need them. A little bit of turmeric in my cooking, perhaps, but that’s hardly medicine, is it? I believe in natural remedies, not fancy pills with all sorts of side effects. I've always been very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, really. My husband, he’s always been very sensitive, but me? I’m quite robust. Always have been. I think all this fresh air and hard work builds up a good resistance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. Thank you for all that information. It sounds like you’re a very active and generally healthy woman, despite some expected aches and pains with age. I think a physical exam would be helpful just to get a baseline and make sure everything is as you say. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, doctor, it seems a bit much. I just wanted a card! But…if it will appease my daughter, I suppose. Just don't go poking and prodding too much, alright? I'm not made of glass. And…it still doesn’t mean I need a card.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. I’ll be gentle. It’s just a quick look to make sure everything is functioning as it should. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your joints, and a few simple things like that. Let's start by checking your blood pressure, just to confirm what you said about it being well-managed. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure, is it? Just to humor my daughter. Honestly, I could tell you right now it's perfectly fine. But go ahead. Don't squeeze too tight, alright? I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm for me. Nice and loose. 138 over 82. Not bad at all. A little elevated, but nothing to be concerned about right now. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me…and another one…good. Sounds clear. Everything sounds normal there. Now, can you tell me if you have any pain in your wrists or hands when I move them?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're poking and prodding. A little bit, yes. When you bend them like that, a dull ache. It's always there, you see? But it's not pain, exactly. Just…discomfort. It's the assembly work, I told you. Small parts, repetitive motions. My daughter thinks I should quit, but what would I do all day?
DOCTOR: I see. There's some slight crepitus in both wrists, which is common with repetitive use. We also have some mild swelling. It looks like you may have some early signs of osteoarthritis, but it’s mild. Now, let’s check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Osteo…what-itis? Is that serious? They're a little stiff, you see? Especially in the mornings. It’s nothing a little bit of movement doesn’t fix. And really, doctor, you're making me feel old just by saying all these things.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Janeth. It's a common condition that comes with age and wear and tear on the joints. It can cause stiffness and discomfort, but it’s usually manageable with exercise and simple measures. I’m not trying to make you feel old, I’m just trying to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Now, one last thing. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… There. See? Perfectly fine. A little creaky, perhaps. But perfectly functional. Honestly, doctor, I think I’ve wasted an hour just to have you tell me I'm getting old. And I still haven't gotten my card!
DOCTOR: You're right, you are perfectly functional, Janeth. And I apologize if the examination felt a bit long. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you’re experiencing mild osteoarthritis in your wrists and knees, which is very common at your age. It’s well-managed with your current level of activity. I’m not going to prescribe any medications at this time, but I recommend continuing to stay active, and I can provide you with some simple exercises to help strengthen your joints and reduce discomfort. I’ll also write you a referral to a physical therapist who can teach you some more targeted exercises. And yes, I’ll certainly write you a note confirming your visit and overall good health. Will that appease your daughter?
PATIENT: A note, is it? And exercises? Well…that's…something, I suppose. Better than nothing. As long as it will get her off my back. And the exercises…if they’re not too strenuous, maybe. But don't expect me to start running marathons, alright? I’m perfectly happy with my current level of activity. And...do make sure it says I'm in good health. Very good health.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. Very good health. I’ll make a note of that. I’ll also include a list of gentle exercises you can try at home, and the physical therapist will tailor a program specifically for you. I'll have the nurse print out the note and the exercise list for you before you leave. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just…get me that note, alright? And perhaps a little bit of sympathy for my poor, aching joints. It was…nice meeting you, doctor. Even if you did poke and prod a bit too much.
DOCTOR: It was nice meeting you too, Janeth. And I apologize again for the poking and prodding. I’ll have the nurse bring those documents to you in just a moment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and remember to stay active! .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. I suppose. A card… Honestly, it's the principle of the thing.
