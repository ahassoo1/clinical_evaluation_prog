DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Hello Doctor. I need… check for referee. For… sports. I need to be sure I am… strong enough? For work. It is for fitness, yes? I do sports referee. Need evaluation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. You’re seeking a fitness evaluation to ensure you’re healthy enough to continue working as a sports referee. That's perfectly reasonable. To get a better understanding of your needs, could you tell me a bit more about the demands of your work?
PATIENT: Demands? Hmm. Running. A lot of running. And… stopping quick. Whistle. And… sometimes people are… angry. Not fight angry, but… yelling. It is… stressful sometimes. And long hours on feet. That is the… demands. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. So, a significant amount of running, quick starts and stops, being on your feet for extended periods, and dealing with potentially stressful situations. We’ll want to assess your cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal system, and overall stress tolerance. To start, have you had any recent illnesses or injuries that might affect your ability to perform these duties?
PATIENT: Injuries… uh. Last year, twist ankle. Small. But took two weeks to feel normal. Before that… nothing much. Just old. You know? Old man aches. No big problems. No sickness this year. Just… tired sometimes. Work is hard. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, a twisted ankle about a year ago that resolved with two weeks of rest, and some general fatigue. We'll definitely factor that in. When you say “tired sometimes,” can you describe that fatigue a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… like… after running, very breathe hard. And legs feel heavy. Not pain, just… slow. And sometimes, even when I rest, feel… not full energy. Like… battery low. I don’t know how to say. Not sick tired, just… work tired. Is that… good enough? I am not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Shanor, you’re explaining it very well. So, fatigue that’s worse after exertion, and a general feeling of low energy even with rest. Do you notice this fatigue impacting your ability to perform your referee duties at all?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes I make… slow calls. Not wrong, just… slower to react. And… forget things. Small things. Like which team had the ball last. Important things for work. I worry about… messing up. That is why I am here. To be sure I am okay. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that is absolutely not bad. It's very responsible of you to address this. Difficulty with quick reactions and some memory lapses are important things to investigate. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Doctor said I was… strong for Chinese man. Just… regular checkups. Blood pressure always… good. No diabetes. No heart problems. My wife… she had some problems, but I… I do not. Just… normal. Is that… enough? I do not like hospitals. Or doctors. Too many… bad memories.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. We’ll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. No prior diagnoses, which is good. And you've had regular checkups with normal blood pressure. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… water. Sometimes tea. Wife… she take a lot of pills. I do not like pills. Make me feel… sick. I try to be strong, natural. No need for… chemicals. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. No medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat everything. Except… durian. Too smelly. But not allergy, just… dislike. Everything else is okay. No hives. No trouble breathing. No… anything. Is that… enough? I am getting… nervous now. This is… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Shanor. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. No allergies, which is good. Finally, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father… heart problems. He… died when I was young. My mother… long life, but… weak bones. She broke hip. No one else… much problems. Lots of farmers. Hard work, but… healthy people. Is that… enough? I do not know much about family history. They did not talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your father and osteoporosis in your mother. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Shanor, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your range of motion and reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Blood pressure… I worry about that. But… okay. Quick, yes? Please be quick. I have… work later. Need to be fast. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here and relax your arm… Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s within a normal range, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good airflow bilaterally. Now, can you please stand up and I'll check your range of motion?
PATIENT: Okay. Standing… deep breath. Range of motion… What does that mean? I am not… very flexible. Old man, remember? Please be gentle. My legs… sometimes ache. I do not want to… fall.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. Range of motion just means I’m checking how well your joints move. We'll go slow and gentle. No need to push yourself. Arms have full range of motion, no pain or limitations. Legs… slight stiffness in the knees, but good range of motion overall. No pain with movement. Spine has normal flexibility. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Please sit back down… Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, with some minor stiffness in the knees. This is not uncommon with activity.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. Normal… that is… good. So… I am okay to referee? Can I go back to work? I need to know. I have game tonight. Is… is my heart okay? That is… most important.
DOCTOR: Based on your medical history and the physical exam, I don’t see any immediate contraindications to you continuing your work as a sports referee. Your heart sounds were normal, and your blood pressure is within an acceptable range. However, the fatigue you’re experiencing and the stiffness in your knees are things we should investigate further. To rule out any underlying medical conditions, I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to assess your heart function more thoroughly. Additionally, I'd like to discuss some strategies to manage your fatigue, such as proper hydration and warm-up exercises. While awaiting the results of these tests, I would advise you to listen to your body. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or significant fatigue during a game, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Would you like me to order these tests for you today?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Okay. But… can I still referee tonight? Just… one game? I need to… make money. And I promised my team. If… if I am careful? Please? I do not want to… worry them. If tests take long… can I get result quickly? And… expensive? I do not have much… money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Shanor. Given your need to work and your commitment to your team, and the fact that your initial exam didn't reveal any immediate red flags, I can’t definitively say you can’t referee tonight. However, I strongly advise you to proceed with caution. Limit your exertion, take frequent breaks, and be particularly attentive to any symptoms like chest pain, dizziness, or unusual fatigue. If you experience any of those symptoms, stop immediately. Regarding the tests, a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel usually cost around $150 to $200, depending on the lab. The EKG typically costs between $50 and $150. We can discuss options if cost is a significant concern – perhaps a phased approach to testing. We can also check if your insurance covers any of these costs. I can have the lab draw blood today and schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. Results usually take 24-48 hours. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay. Reasonable… yes. So… blood today. EKG tomorrow. And… careful tonight. Limit… limit how much run. That is… okay. Insurance… I have private. I will… ask them. And… if too expensive, maybe just blood? No EKG? If blood is okay… maybe that is enough? I need… work. I understand. Careful. That is… all I need. Please… write down what I need. For blood. And insurance number. And… thank you, Doctor. You… very helpful. Even with many questions. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Shanor. Here’s a summary of what we discussed. It includes the lab order for the complete blood count, information about the EKG, and a form for insurance pre-authorization. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and their phone number is 555-123-4567. Please, remember to listen to your body and prioritize your health. If you experience any concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. And you're very welcome. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
