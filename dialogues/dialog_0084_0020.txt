DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth visit, yes? My… everything feels a little slow these days. Not sick, just… old, maybe. I am 57.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're feeling a bit slower than usual, not necessarily sick, but just noticing the effects of time. That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Benites. “Slow” can mean a lot of things though. Can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Yes, “slow” is good word. It is… takes longer to get up from chair. And… when I work on car, sometimes I forget what tool I need. Not all time, but… more than before. My hands, they are not as fast as they used to be. It is… worrying, a little. I like to fix cars, you see? Is important to me.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a combination of things – some physical slowness, like getting up, and some changes in your cognitive function, like occasionally forgetting things while you're working on your car. That's good information. And it's good that you're noticing these changes and are bringing them to my attention. Let's start with the physical side. You mentioned difficulty getting up from a chair. Is that a new symptom, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Maybe… six months ago, I notice it first. Not bad then, just… little harder. Now… sometimes I need to use arms to push myself up. Is not pain, just… weak feeling. And my knees… they are not so strong as they used to be. I work on my feet all day, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over about six months, with increasing difficulty getting up and a feeling of weakness, especially in your knees. You mentioned working on your feet all day – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I am mechanic. Automotive service technician. I fix cars. I have my own little shop, yes? Not big, but I make good living. Been doing it long time. Since I was young man… well, young woman, then. It is… hard work. Lots of bending, lifting, standing. But I like it.
DOCTOR: That's a physically demanding job, Ms. Benites. It's understandable that your body might be feeling the effects after many years. Let’s talk a little more about this “weakness” you’re describing. Is it just in your legs, or do you feel it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Mostly in legs, I think. But… sometimes my hands feel tired too. When I am using wrench for long time, they get… achy. Not pain, but… uncomfortable. And I drop things more often. Small things, like screws, you see? It is… frustrating. I used to be very steady with my hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, so leg weakness, hand fatigue and achiness, and some difficulty with dexterity – dropping things more often. Those are all things we need to consider. Now, let’s go back to the cognitive side for a moment. You mentioned forgetting what tool you need. Can you give me a specific example of that?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Last week, I was changing oil filter. I had all the tools there, yes? But… I looked at the car, I looked at the tools, and I… could not remember the right size wrench. I knew I needed a wrench, but… what size? I stood there for five minutes, looking. My helper, he gave it to me, of course. But… I should know this. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Benites. It's frustrating when you find yourself struggling with things you used to do easily. It's good you're aware of these changes and want to address them. Before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly cover some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your memory besides the occasional difficulty with tools?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not so much… remembering. I remember things from long time ago very good. But… sometimes I forget… what I was saying. Mid-sentence, you see? Or… why I went into room. Small things like that. Nothing big, but… it happens more often now. I do not think is… serious, but… I notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like short-term memory is the area that's more affected - forgetting things you just did or were about to do, or losing your train of thought mid-sentence. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not so much. I was… healthy woman, always. I have a little high blood pressure, doctor told me. I take pills for it. But… that is all. I had surgery on my knee, long time ago, but… it healed good. No… diabetes, no… heart problems. I think. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. High blood pressure is good to know, and we’ll talk about your medication in a bit. And the knee surgery - when was that, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? I was younger then! I tripped over… a tire, I think. Tore something in my knee. They fixed it with surgery, and I was okay after that. No pain now, just… sometimes stiff. Is that… important? I do not remember many details. It was a long time ago, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don't remember the details, Ms. Benites. Knowing it happened is helpful. Twenty years ago, knee surgery… good. Let’s move on to your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any medical conditions like memory problems, dementia, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mama… she got old, very old. She… forgetful sometimes, in the end. But I think is just… old age. She lived to be 90! My papa… he was strong, healthy man. No… problems with mind. My sister… she is healthy too. No… I do not think so. Nothing I remember, yes? But… I do not know everything. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your mother had some forgetfulness in old age, but no other known family history of neurological conditions. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned taking pills for your blood pressure. Can you tell me what the name of the medication is, and what dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… difficult. I have many pills. I take them every morning. I think… is lisinopril? Yes, I think so. And… 20 milligrams? I am not sure. My husband… he always took care of pills. After he… passed, I just take them. I do not know the exact dosage anymore. Is that… bad? I am sorry. I should know this, yes?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Benites. It’s understandable that it can be confusing, especially after a loss. Don’t worry about it. We can easily look up your medications on your record. Okay, I see here you are currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. And you mentioned no other medications?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. That is all. No… other pills. Just vitamins sometimes, but not every day. Is that… everything for now? I am ready for examination, if you like.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's proceed with a physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Then, I'd like to check your range of motion and strength in your legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I will cooperate. Just… tell me if anything hurts. And… be gentle, please? My knees are not so good.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated but not critically high. Your pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes... Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let's check your balance... Okay, a little unsteady, but you're able to maintain your balance. Now, let's check the range of motion and strength in your legs... You have some mild stiffness in both knees, and your strength is a little reduced, especially in your right leg. No pain with these movements, is that correct?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… a little uncomfortable. The right leg… it is always weaker. I think is because I tripped on tire long time ago. The surgery… it helped, but is not same as before. The stiffness… is more in the morning, yes? It gets better after I move around a little. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Ms. Benites. The stiffness being worse in the morning and improving with movement is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common condition after an injury like yours. I don’t feel any significant swelling or tenderness in your knees or ankles. Your gait seems a little slower and less fluid than normal, but you are able to walk without assistance. Based on the examination, you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees, with more involvement on the right side. Your neurological exam is largely normal, with slightly diminished reflexes and mild unsteadiness, which could be related to age or the changes you've been experiencing. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I'd also like to order an MRI of your knees to assess the cartilage and ligaments more closely. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. MRI, blood tests… yes. I want to know what is happening. And… I want to be able to fix cars for many years yet, you see? Is important to me. Just… tell me if it will be expensive. My Medicare… is it enough?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Benites. It's important to get this addressed so you can continue doing what you love. Okay, I'm ordering a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and vitamin D level. We'll also order an MRI of both knees without contrast. Let me check your Medicare coverage. Yes, your Medicare should cover most of the cost of these tests. There may be a small deductible or co-pay depending on your plan, but it should be manageable. The lab will confirm the exact costs before they perform the tests. I will have my assistant schedule you for the blood tests and MRI. They will contact you directly to arrange the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your Lisinopril as prescribed. I also suggest you try to stay active, but avoid any strenuous activities that aggravate your knee pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage the pain. We'll review the results of the tests at your follow-up appointment, which I’d like to schedule in about two weeks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks is good. And… thank you, Doctor. You are very… thorough. I feel better already, knowing what is happening. Just… let me know if I need to do anything special before the tests. And… thank you again. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. No, there’s nothing special you need to do before the tests. Just eat and drink normally. My assistant will provide you with more detailed instructions when they contact you to schedule the appointments. We’ll discuss the results in two weeks. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Ms. Benites. And please, take care of yourself. .
