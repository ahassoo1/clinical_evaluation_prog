DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dashevsky, you say? Hmm. Yes. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Doctor said I need to… check in with someone. Medicare, you know? Old man things. Not much wrong, wrong. Just… paperwork, I think.
DOCTOR: Right, a new patient check-up. That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Szmyd. And a good idea to establish care when you move. I see here you’re with Medicare, excellent. Just to get a better understanding of your overall health, even if you're feeling generally well, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Questions? Yes, alright. But don't ask me about… computers. I don't understand those things. And I don't remember much, really. Old age. You understand. Just… ask, I guess. Simple things. Not… complicated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Simple things, no problem at all. We'll take things at your pace. And no computers, I promise. Let's start with your general health. Have you been feeling generally well, or have you noticed any particular symptoms lately – anything at all that’s been bothering you, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… I work. Makeup, you know? For the… stage. Theaters. So, I’m always on my feet. A little tired, maybe. Old job. But nothing… serious. My back, sometimes. Old injury. A long time ago. But I manage. I put a lot of cream on it. Very good cream.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're working as a makeup artist for the theater, which involves being on your feet a lot. That’s good to know. And you experience some back pain, an old injury that you manage with cream. Can you tell me a little more about this back pain?
PATIENT: Back pain… yes. It comes and goes. Mostly when I bend over. Picking things up. Or… when it's cold. Damp weather makes it worse. I don’t like the rain. Used to be much worse. But the cream helps. I put it on every night. Very expensive cream. Russian cream. Best cream in the world. I think. Can't remember the name now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain flares up with bending and cold, damp weather, and the Russian cream seems to help. That's good to know it provides some relief. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your back pain is on a typical day when it's bothering you?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. I don't like numbers. But… if I have to… maybe a four? Sometimes five, if it's really cold. It doesn’t stop me from working. I just… move slower. And I complain a little. My wife used to tell me to stop complaining. She… she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Szmyd. That must be difficult. And a four or five on a bad day… that's helpful to know. It sounds like it's manageable, but still impacting your daily activities. Now, apart from the back pain, have you noticed any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. I get… tired. Very tired. But I always been tired. Work, you know? Long hours. And… sometimes my hands ache. From holding the brushes. Maybe arthritis? My mother had that. Very painful for her. I put cream on my hands too. Different cream. Not the Russian one. This one smells like… flowers.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some aching in your hands, particularly with work. And you suspect it might be arthritis, as your mother had it. Do the aches in your hands come on gradually, or suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Not bang suddenly. Slowly. Over time. It’s worse in the morning. When I wake up. Fingers are stiff. I have to… rub them. For a long time. Before I can hold the brushes properly. It’s… annoying. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the hand aches are gradual in onset, worse in the morning and improve with rubbing. That does sound like it could be related to arthritis. Now, aside from the back pain, fatigue and hand aches, have you noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep recently?
PATIENT: Weight… hmm. I think I’ve lost a little. Not much. Clothes are a little… looser. Appetite… yes, not as good as it used to be. Small portions now. And sleep… ah, sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. Can’t get back to sleep. Thinking… about things. Old things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some weight loss, decreased appetite, and trouble sleeping. I see. We're building a pretty good picture here, Mr. Szmyd. Now, just to get a more complete understanding, have you had any major medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses… hmm. Long time ago, I had… pneumonia. Very sick. Spent a long time in the hospital. But that was… many years ago. Surgeries… I had my appendix out. When I was a boy. Very small cut. Nothing serious. And… I think I broke my arm once, when I was little. Fell from a tree.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a young man, appendix removed, and a broken arm as a child. That's good to know. And have you ever been told you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High… what was that first one? High… pressure? I don't remember. The doctor used to take my blood. Always said it was… okay. Maybe. I don't pay attention to those things. Cholesterol… no, never heard of that. Diabetes… my aunt had that. Very sick. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes that you're aware of. I see. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just the cream. For my back and hands. Lots of cream. And sometimes I take a… something for my stomach. When it's upset. A little white pill. I buy it at the… drug store. Can't remember the name. Very common. Everyone takes it. Vitamins… no, no vitamins. Not good for you, those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the cream for your back and hands and a stomach medication as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. I like food. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes, when I touch certain flowers. But not… serious. Nothing that sends me to the hospital. My wife was allergic to cats. Very bad allergy. Couldn’t be in the same room.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies, aside from your wife’s cat allergy. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I work. A lot. Makeup, you know? Stage. Theaters. I don’t… travel much. Stay close to home. I used to… drink vodka. But not anymore. Not good for my stomach. And I don’t smoke. Never liked it. Quiet life. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life centered around your work, with no smoking or current alcohol use. That’s good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… yes, alright. But don't poke me too much. I’m an old man. And… don’t ask me to take off my shoes. I like my shoes. Very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Szmyd. No shoe removal, and I'll be gentle. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. It's a little tight, but it won't hurt. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear on both sides. Ears look normal, some wax build-up. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Okay, everything sounds and looks fairly good. No major concerns.
PATIENT: Hmm. Sounds good. Everything sounds… good. You didn't poke me too much. Thank you. So… what does this mean? Am I… dying?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Mr. Szmyd. You are not dying. Everything sounds and looks reasonably good for your age and lifestyle. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we can monitor and potentially address with some lifestyle changes. Your heart sounds are a little faint, which is common with age. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, I think we’re dealing with some normal wear and tear, a bit of fatigue from your work, and possibly some early signs of arthritis in your hands. We'll want to monitor your blood pressure, and I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relief for your hands if needed. Would you like to discuss some options for managing your back pain and hand aches?
PATIENT: Pain relief… yes, that would be good. And… what about the tiredness? Is there something for that? I just want to… feel a little better. Not so… achy. And maybe sleep a little longer. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Szmyd. It’s completely reasonable to want to feel better and sleep more comfortably. For your hands, I recommend trying an over-the-counter NSAID like ibuprofen or naproxen. Follow the dosage instructions on the label carefully, and be sure to let me know if you experience any stomach upset. Heat packs can also be helpful. As for the tiredness, there are a few things we can consider. We can check some bloodwork to rule out any underlying deficiencies, like vitamin D or B12. Sometimes, simple things like improving your sleep hygiene can make a big difference. That means having a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Would you like me to order some bloodwork?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… hmm. I don’t like needles. But… if you think it will help, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… I need to go to work tomorrow. Can't be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. We'll keep it as quick and painless as possible. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. The bloodwork will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and vitamin D and B12 levels. We’ll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, let's focus on those pain relief options for your hands and back, and try to prioritize some good sleep habits. I'll also write you a note outlining what we’ve discussed today, and a list of resources on sleep hygiene. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Sleep hygiene… yes, that sounds complicated. And… what if the cream stops working? For my back? I’ve been using it for a long time. I don’t want to… change creams. I like my cream.
DOCTOR: Sleep hygiene just means making some small adjustments to your routine to help you sleep better. I'll give you a handout with some simple tips. As for your cream, it’s good that it’s been working for you. If it stops being effective, we can discuss other options, but we don’t need to change anything right now. Sometimes, alternating between different creams, or adding a warm compress, can help. There are also some gentle stretching exercises that can be beneficial for back pain. I’m happy to discuss those options with you at your next appointment. For now, let’s focus on getting the bloodwork done and seeing what that reveals. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Yes, a follow-up… alright. Next week? Same time? If that’s alright. I need to… arrange my work schedule. Very busy man, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, next week at the same time works perfectly. That's August 9th. We'll review the bloodwork results and discuss any further steps, if needed. I’ll also give you a copy of your visit summary and the handout on sleep hygiene. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You didn't poke me too much. And… you listened. That’s good. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I’m glad I could help. And I apologize for any discomfort during the exam. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and try to get some rest. .
