DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc... it's this puffiness, see? My face, and… down here. <points vaguely at legs> It just kinda… happened. Not sure when exactly, truthfully. Feels like a while, though. It's botherin' me, that's for sure. Makes my boots feel tight, and I look… well, not myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Puffiness in your face and legs that's been developing over some time. That definitely sounds bothersome. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say it "just kinda happened," can you think of anything that might have coincided with it starting?
PATIENT: Coincided…? Hmm. <scratches head> Not really. Things been pretty… regular, I suppose. Lost my wife, bless her, a few years back. That was a shock, naturally. But that was… a while ago now. Can't rightly say anything caused it. Just woke up one day, and there it was. I eat… normal, I guess. Not fancy, but normal. Maybe a bit more salt than I should, but who doesn't? Honestly, doc, I'm not one for rememberin' dates or… causes. Things just are.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you sharing that with me. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that you’re focusing on the present. It's helpful to know things have been relatively stable otherwise. So, “normal” eating, maybe a bit more salt than average… and this puffiness has gradually increased over time. When you look in the mirror, is it worse in the mornings, or does it stay pretty consistent throughout the day?
PATIENT: Mornings, I think. Yeah, definitely mornings. I wake up lookin' like a… well, like a balloon. It goes down a little during the day, but never goes away away. I usually have a cup of coffee and a biscuit, then get to work. <shrugs> Don't pay much mind to how I look, usually. Just gotta get on with it, you know? But it's gettin' harder to ignore now. Especially the boots. Can't be havin' that.
DOCTOR: I understand. Worse in the mornings, improves slightly throughout the day, and is impacting your ability to wear your boots. That gives us a good starting point. Let's do a quick run-through of some other things. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or have you been feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a little winded climbin' stairs, but that’s just gettin’ old, I reckon. And tired… well, who isn't tired? I work hard all day, standin' on my feet. <pauses> Now that I think about it... maybe a little more tired than usual, but I just figured that was the heat. It’s been a scorcher this summer. Doesn’t seem worth fussin’ over, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased tiredness, possibly related to the heat, and no significant shortness of breath. That’s good to know. Do you have any pain anywhere – chest pain, joint pain, back pain – or any other symptoms at all that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: Pain… nah, not really. My back gets a little stiff after a long day, but that's just old age again. And sometimes my hands ache a bit, but that’s from the welding, you know? Sparks and all. <fidgets with his hands> No, doc, nothin’ really. Just… puffy. And tired. Is it somethin’ serious? I’m not one for doctors, if you catch my drift. Always seemed like a waste of time, 'til now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate you coming in to see me. It's good that you’ve come in now. Okay, no significant pain, just puffiness and increased fatigue. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and feet. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: <grunts> Fine, fine. Get it over with. Don't like bein' poked and prodded, but if you gotta, you gotta. Just be quick about it, alright? I got work to do. And I don't hold with fancy gadgets. Keep it simple, doc. Simple.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. We'll keep it simple. First, let's check your blood pressure. <I wrap the cuff around your upper arm and take a reading.> 150/90. A little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. <I listen to your chest with the stethoscope.> Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear. Finally, let's take a look at your legs and feet. <I examine your legs, noting some swelling around the ankles and feet. I gently press on the skin, observing some pitting edema - indentations that remain after pressure is applied.> I see some swelling in your ankles and feet, and when I press on the skin, it leaves a little indentation for a few seconds. That’s what we call pitting edema. <I document my findings.> Do you have any history of kidney problems or heart issues?
PATIENT: Kidney problems…? Never. Not that I know of. Always been able to… well, you know. Used to drink a fair bit of coffee, but that's just for keepin' awake. Heart issues… no. Dad had somethin' when he was old, but I didn’t pay much mind to it. I just kept workin’. Always been a strong fella, I am. Didn't believe in sittin' around feelin' sorry for myself. <pauses> Honestly, doc, I don’t keep track of all that medical… stuff. Is this bad? You're makin' me nervous now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known kidney problems or heart issues, and a family history of some unspecified heart issue in your father. I understand your nervousness, and I apologize if I’m causing you any worry. The swelling and elevated blood pressure do warrant some further investigation. It could be a number of things, but we need to rule out some possibilities. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and look for signs of heart problems. I’ll also order a urine test. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. I haven't taken much in the way of medicine in… well, ever. Used to rub some liniment on my back when it was stiff, but that's about it. Never had any reactions. <shrugs> Contrast dyes… what are those? You’re talkin’ over my head now, doc. I just wanna get this puffiness sorted, that’s all. Is this gonna cost a fortune? I’m on a fixed income, you see. Widow’s pension doesn't stretch far.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand your concern about the cost, and I’ll do my best to keep things as affordable as possible. Contrast dyes are sometimes used in imaging tests like CT scans or X-rays, but we're not talking about those right now. The blood tests will give us a good starting point, and they shouldn't be overly expensive. I’ll write you a requisition for the lab, and they should be able to give you an idea of the cost before they proceed. <I hand you a lab requisition form.> The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. Once you've had the tests done, you can bring the results back to me, and we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and trying to elevate your legs whenever possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: <takes the form, squinting at it> Salt… right. Less salt. Easier said than done, with all the processed stuff these days. And elevatin’ my legs… <looks down at his legs> I suppose I can do that when I’m watchin’ the telly. Alright, alright. I'll get these tests done. Don't expect miracles, though. I’m not one for fussin’ over myself. Just tell me when to come back. <starts to get up slowly> This has been… a lot. <pauses at the door> Thanks, doc. I guess. Hopefully, it’s not somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Derick. We’ll take things one step at a time. Bring the results back whenever you have them, and we'll go from there. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, take care of yourself. .
