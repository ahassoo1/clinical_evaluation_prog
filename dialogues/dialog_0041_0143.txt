DOCTOR: Hi Smith, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about… starting a family, I think. My… friend and I, we’re thinking about having a baby. I just… want to make sure everything is okay first, you know? It’s been a long time, and I want to be… prepared. I don’t really remember what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Right, that's very sensible, Smith. Planning ahead is always a good idea. It has been a while for some folks, and things do change. So, just to clarify… you and your friend are hoping to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Conceive… is that what they call it? Having a baby. Yes. We haven’t… started yet, though. That’s why I wanted to talk to you. Before we do anything. I want to be sure I’m… healthy enough. And… what she needs to do too, I suppose. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Very good that you're coming in before starting. We can definitely get things sorted out. Let's start with you, then we can talk about what your friend might consider. Just to get a good picture, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, um… general health… Well, I work. Sales Engineers, you know? Lots of travel, sometimes. I try to eat okay… not too much junk food. I walk a bit when I travel, but not much exercise really. I don’t… I don’t get sick very often, I don’t think. I had a little cough last winter, but that was it. Oh, and my back… it gets a bit sore sometimes from the traveling. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Smith. The travel and back soreness are good things to note. And it’s good you don’t get sick often. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? No, I don't think so. Nobody ever told me. Diabetes… no. Heart problems… not that I know of. I had some trouble with my stomach a long time ago, when I was younger, but that cleared up. It was… years ago. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. I just… took some medicine and it went away.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries at all, Smith?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a little boy, a long, long time ago. They… fixed it, I guess. Put a cast on. That’s the only thing I can remember. Nothing else. I don’t think I’ve had any other surgeries. It’s all very… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family… That’s a tough one. My… my father, he had some trouble with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my mother… she had… I don’t know. Something with her… bones, maybe? She was always complaining about aches and pains. It was a long time ago, I don't really remember. Nobody ever talked about it much. It wasn't a very… talkative family, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand, Smith. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history. Any siblings?
PATIENT: Yes. I have a sister, she lives… far away now. I haven’t seen her in many years. She seems healthy enough, as far as I know. I haven’t really kept in touch. I don’t think she has any… major problems. But I wouldn’t really know for sure. We don't… talk about those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Smith?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my back, when it’s really sore. It’s just… over-the-counter stuff. Painkillers, I suppose. Nothing a doctor prescribed. Just… ibuprofen, or something like that. I don’t take it very often. Only when I really need to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food, pollen, or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a runny nose when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s all. Nothing serious. I'm not allergic to any food that I know of. I eat everything. I don't think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to an insect sting either. I can't really remember, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Smith. Thank you for sharing all that. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to get a better sense of things. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just a general check-up. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Blood pressure, you say? I hope it's not too high. I've been a bit stressed lately, thinking about all this. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table for me, we’ll get started. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, just relax your arm… 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness noted. Reflexes are normal and equal. Everything seems generally alright, Smith. I do want to run a few blood tests, just to get a more complete picture of your overall health. It’ll give us some baseline numbers to work with. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests… alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I want to be sure everything is okay, for… for both of us. So yes, let’s do the blood tests. What do I need to do? Do I need to… fast beforehand? I don’t remember what’s involved.
DOCTOR: Good. Yes, we’ll need you to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We’ll also check a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some thyroid function tests. And, just to be thorough, we’ll check your vitamin D levels. We can do the draw right here in the clinic. Does tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… hmm. Yes, that should be okay. Tomorrow morning… I’ll make sure I don’t eat anything. 8-12 hours… alright, I can do that. Just water. Vitamin D… is that important? I don’t really spend much time in the sun. I travel a lot, you see. So yes, tomorrow morning is fine. What time should I come? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. You can come in anytime after 8:00 AM tomorrow. And no, it shouldn’t hurt much. It’s just a quick prick, and it’s over before you know it. The phlebotomist is very good, and she’ll be gentle. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try not to worry. It’s good that you’re being proactive about this. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… alright for now. Tomorrow morning, after 8:00… and no food. I’ll remember that. And try not to worry… yes. That’s good advice. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a bit better now, just knowing what we need to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Smith. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and make sure you're in good shape. See you tomorrow morning. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good evening.
