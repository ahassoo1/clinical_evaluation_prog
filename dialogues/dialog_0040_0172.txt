DOCTOR: Right, Candice Engelhaupt. 79, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, frankly, I don't see what my age has to do with anything. I just moved here, and my husband insisted I come in for one of these… social visits. Honestly, it all seems rather unnecessary. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Well, it's standard procedure for new patients, especially… those of a certain age. Helps us get a baseline. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Baseline? Goodness. Well, as I said, my husband, Harold, felt I should establish care with a doctor in the area. We relocated from… oh dear, where were we? It was a perfectly pleasant town, I assure you. It’s not that I feel ill, precisely. Just… a courtesy, I believe. Are you quite finished with the questions about where I used to live?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Engelhaupt, I have other patients waiting. If there's nothing specific bothering you, we can do a quick check-up and be done with it. But I need something to work with. Any aches, pains, fatigue, changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Really. I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Harold cooks lovely meals. Though, I suppose I haven’t been quite as hungry lately… but that's probably just the heat. It's been dreadfully warm, hasn't it? Honestly, these questions are quite… invasive. I suppose my knees ache a bit when it rains… but that’s to be expected at my age.
DOCTOR: Knees. Right. And the appetite change…how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… a few weeks, I suppose. Perhaps a month? It's all rather blurred. Honestly, I don't spend my days meticulously cataloging my meals, doctor. I have better things to do. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: A month. Okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I've been feeling a bit… listless, I suppose. Not my usual self. Though, I attribute that to the move. It’s unsettling, leaving everything behind, you know? All my friends, my garden… It's not easy, at my age. Is there a conclusion to this line of questioning, Doctor? I truly do have other engagements.
DOCTOR: Listless... Alright. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh dear. Harold did mention my dresses seemed a bit… loose. But I haven't been weighing myself. I rather avoid the scale, if I’m being honest. It's a sensitive subject. Honestly, I don’t see what my weight has to do with anything. I eat perfectly adequate meals, as I’ve already said!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse… standard stuff. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Stand up? Oh, now see here… I’m not as nimble as I used to be, Doctor. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being rushed. Harold always said I shouldn’t strain myself. Is it absolutely necessary? I’m sure we can discuss this perfectly well without me having to… perform for you.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, it's a simple check of your blood pressure while standing. It’s a standard part of a new patient exam to rule out… things. Please, just stand up. I’m not asking you to run a marathon.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But if I should fall, I hold you entirely responsible. Honestly, the indignity of it all… There. Are you satisfied?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little low, and it dropped when you stood up. Pulse is…weak. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Take a deep breath... and exhale.
PATIENT: Honestly, I always feel quite self-conscious when someone listens to my chest. It's…intrusive. Are you detecting anything amiss, Doctor? It's probably just old age, if you ask me. I never had a strong constitution, even as a girl. Just hurry it along, please. My husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a little… diminished. And I detect some mild crackling. Okay. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just relax. Does this hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: Crackling? Goodness. That sounds dreadful. No, my abdomen doesn't hurt, precisely. It's just… tender. Everything is tender at my age, Doctor. You're prodding around quite a bit, you know. Honestly, I’m beginning to feel rather faint. Are you sure you're a qualified physician?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Engelhaupt, I think we've gathered enough for now. I’m going to order some blood work, just to rule things out. And I’d like you to get a chest X-ray. It will help me determine what's going on.
PATIENT: Blood work? An X-ray? Oh, this is just getting ridiculous. I haven't done any of those things in… decades. What precisely are you hoping to find, Doctor? It’s probably just a bit of a cold. Honestly, I think I'm perfectly fine. Are you certain all of this is necessary? I simply came in for a social visit, remember?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, with your age, the weight loss, the low blood pressure, the diminished breath sounds...it's not just a cold. We need to rule out pneumonia, heart failure, a number of other things. The blood work and X-ray will give us a clearer picture. The nurse will schedule those for you. I'm also going to refer you to a cardiologist, just for a precautionary evaluation.
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Goodness gracious. This is all so… unnecessary. And frightening. My husband is going to be furious. I simply wanted to meet my new doctor, not be subjected to a battery of tests and… specialists! I do wish Harold hadn’t insisted on this visit. This is all a terrible mistake. Is it possible to simply… go home now?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Engelhaupt, I understand your anxiety, but it is not a mistake. Your symptoms warrant a thorough investigation. The nurse will explain everything. And yes, you can go home now, after the nurse has scheduled those tests and given you instructions. Don’t ignore this. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose. But I still maintain this is all rather… excessive. I do wish someone would explain all of this to Harold. He’s terribly worried about my health. And I sincerely hope these tests aren't too… invasive. Honestly, this has been most unsettling. I do hope the nurse is… patient.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly. Please, just try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
