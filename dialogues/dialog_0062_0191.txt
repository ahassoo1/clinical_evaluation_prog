DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I requested a test for HIV. I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. It's a bit personal, but I prefer knowing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tierney. That's very responsible of you, and I completely understand wanting to have peace of mind. It's always better to know, and it's a very common request. Before we proceed with the test, I'd like to ask a few questions – just to get a better understanding of your overall health and risk factors. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Ask away. I’ll answer to the best of my ability. I hope I can be of assistance.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Nothing major, really. I had a bout of malaria a few years back, when I visited my village, but that was treated quickly. Otherwise… no, not that I recall. I do get occasional headaches, but nothing a bit of rest doesn't fix. My husband says I worry too much, which I suspect contributes to them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Malaria is important to mention, thank you. And the occasional headaches – we can certainly talk about those later if they become more frequent or bothersome. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never been hospitalized. And no surgeries either. I’ve always been quite fortunate with my health, thankfully. A few childhood illnesses, like measles and chickenpox, but nothing serious that required a hospital visit or anything like that. My mother always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Tierney. A strong constitution is a great thing to have! Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, she passed away a few years ago from… well, from old age, mostly. But before that, she had some issues with her joints, arthritis, I believe. My father, he lived a long life as well, but he developed high blood pressure in his later years. And my brother… he has asthma, has had it since he was a child. So, arthritis, high blood pressure, and asthma… that’s what comes to mind, immediately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information, thank you. Arthritis, high blood pressure, and asthma – good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m retired now, Doctor. Used to work as a parking attendant, quite a physical job actually, all that walking and checking tickets. Now, I spend my time mostly at home with my husband. We enjoy gardening, and I like to cook. We go to church on Sundays, of course. I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of vegetables and fruits.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling retirement, Tierney. Staying active with gardening and cooking is wonderful, and attending church is lovely. And it’s good to hear about not smoking and limited alcohol consumption. Now, I’m going to ask a potentially sensitive question, and please feel free to answer only what you're comfortable sharing. This is important for assessing risk factors for HIV. Have you ever shared needles with anyone, or engaged in unprotected sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That is a sensitive question. Well, Doctor, to be perfectly clear, no, I have never shared needles with anyone. That is quite unthinkable to me. As for… unprotected sexual activity… my husband and I have been married for forty years. We are faithful to each other. We haven't... well, our activity has lessened with age, but we've always been careful. I suppose that answers your question. It's a bit embarrassing to discuss, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Tierney. It is a sensitive topic, and I appreciate your honesty and willingness to discuss it. Forty years of marriage is wonderful, and your faithfulness is reassuring. Just one final question regarding medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional pain reliever for my headaches, Doctor. Paracetamol, usually. Nothing regular, only when they are particularly bad. And sometimes a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. My daughter sends them to me. Otherwise, no, I'm not on any prescription medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Paracetamol and a multivitamin – nothing major. Thank you for answering all of those questions so openly, Tierney. Now, let's talk about the HIV test itself. We can do a simple blood test here in the clinic. It usually takes about 20 minutes to get the preliminary results. Would you like to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Let’s get it done. The sooner I know, the better, really. Twenty minutes is not a long time to wait. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll follow me, we can head to the lab. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very skilled and will make the process as comfortable as possible. I'll be right here in my office when you're finished, and we can discuss the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions before we go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I believe you've covered everything. Thank you.
