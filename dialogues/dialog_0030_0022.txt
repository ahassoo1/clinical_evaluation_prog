DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are 90 years young – that’s wonderful! To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, ninety years… feels like a long time! Um… well, my tummy… it feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… feels off. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve noticed some changes in your appetite and some abdominal fullness, and you’re not quite sure when it began. That’s perfectly alright; we'll work through it together. When you say “big,” could you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… “big”... it’s hard to say. Like… when I sit, it feels tight. Not painful, not really. Just… full. Like I ate a big dinner, but I didn’t! And sometimes, it feels… heavy? Like something is in there, but I don’t know what. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things. It's just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. You’re describing a feeling of fullness and heaviness in your abdomen, even when you haven’t eaten much. No need to apologize at all; you're explaining it just fine. Now, has this feeling been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh… comes and goes, I think. Some days it's better. Not so tight. And some days… like today, it's more noticeable. It’s not every day, no. Maybe… more often now than it used to be? It's hard to remember the before times, you know? Everything feels a little blurry.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Memory can be tricky. So, it’s been gradually getting more frequent. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this fullness and heaviness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! Sometimes… I feel a little tired. More tired than usual, maybe. But I am old, so… And… sometimes I go to the… bathroom… more often. To… you know. But that could just be the tea, maybe? I drink a lot of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and more frequent urination. We'll certainly consider the tea, but it's good you mentioned both. Now, when you say more frequent urination, is that during the day, at night, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly during the day, I think. At night I sleep pretty good… usually. I wake up once maybe, to go, but that's nothing new. It’s the daytime… I seem to go more often than I used to. It's just… a little bit at a time, each time. Not big amounts, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. More frequent, smaller amounts during the day. Now, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a hard one. I saw doctors when my husband was alive, but… it was a long time ago. I think… maybe something with my blood? But I don't remember what exactly. And… my knees, they bother me, of course. But that’s just old age, I always thought. I don't think I have anything serious, you know? It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s very common to forget details over time. We can try to access any records from previous doctors, if you’d like. In the meantime, you mentioned problems with your knees – are those causing you pain, and if so, how would you describe it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my knees. They ache, mostly. A dull ache. Sometimes, when I walk too much, it's sharper. But I don't walk much anymore. I mostly sit and read. They just feel… creaky, you know? Like old hinges. Not terrible, but… noticeable. It's just part of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache with some sharper pain with activity. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… I think… when I was young, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago, when I was a little girl. And… I was in the hospital when I had my daughter, of course! But that wasn't a bad hospital stay, just… normal. I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. Not that I remember. It's all so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and hospitalization for the birth of your daughter. That's helpful. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. But I don't remember exactly what. She was always frail. And my brother… he had trouble with his stomach, I remember that. But I don't know what kind of trouble. Everyone on my side of the family… they weren't very healthy, I suppose. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much. It wasn't like it is now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Some history of heart problems and stomach issues in your family. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. No smoking, no drinking, no… whatever those other things are. I never have. I like my tea, that's all. And reading, of course. A quiet life. I don’t go out much anymore. Not since my husband… A quiet life is a good life.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. McConnon. A quiet life sounds very peaceful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken many medications over the years. Sometimes I take something for my knees, when they really bother me, but I can’t remember what it’s called. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, not that I recall. I eat most things, I think. No fancy foods, just… normal things. Nothing jumps to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: Oh… just the little pills for my knees, sometimes. But not every day. Only when they ache a lot. And… sometimes I take something for my… what do you call it… indigestion? But not often. I forget what they’re called. Little white pills, I think. That's all. I don't take much, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, you said you drink a lot of tea?
PATIENT: Oh yes, lots and lots of tea! Black tea, mostly. A few cups in the morning, a few in the afternoon, and one before bed. It helps me relax, you know? It’s a good habit. It's a good life, tea and reading. A very good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. McConnon. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your abdomen to see if we can get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. My husband always said doctors know best. Go ahead, dear. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, with a normal rate and rhythm. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. I notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the left side. It’s not sharp pain, but it’s definitely a bit sensitive. There doesn’t appear to be any guarding or rigidity. Your abdomen is also slightly distended, or feels fuller than usual.
PATIENT: Oh… sensitive, you say? Yes, that feels… a little bit different there. Not terrible, but… noticeable. I always feel a little bit uncomfortable there sometimes. I thought it was just… old age. A little bit of bloating, maybe? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you pointed that out, Ms. McConnon. It's not necessarily bad, but it's good to know. The tenderness and distention could be related to a number of things. Given your symptoms—the abdominal fullness, changes in appetite, increased fatigue, and more frequent urination—and the findings on the exam, I think it's important to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to have some blood work done, and potentially a urine test?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests… I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s important, then yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… don’t let it take too long, alright? I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. We’ll try to make it as quick and easy as possible. The blood work will help us check your overall health, look for any signs of infection, and assess your kidney and liver function. The urine test will help rule out any urinary tract infection. I’ll write an order for these tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need a small sample of your blood and urine. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh no, no fever or chills. Not nauseous, either. And… no, my bowel habits are… normal, I suppose. A little bit slow sometimes, but that's just getting old, isn't it? Nothing major, Doctor. Just… tired and full. And a little bit worried, now.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. McConnon. It's good that you’re not experiencing any fever, chills, or changes in your bowel habits. That’s reassuring. We'll get these tests done, and once we have the results, we'll have a better understanding of what's going on. While we wait for the results, I would recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, instead of three large ones. And try to stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids—water is best. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… yes, I can try that. And more water. Alright. Hmm… questions… Will the tests… hurt? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? A few days? That feels like a long time. I just want to feel better soon.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Ms. McConnon. The blood draw might feel a quick pinch, but it shouldn't hurt for long. The lab technician is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. And the urine test is completely painless. You'll just need to provide a sample. As for the results, it typically takes 2-3 business days for the lab to send them back to us. I understand that feels like a long time, and I'll do my best to get them reviewed as quickly as possible once they arrive. I’ll also have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or difficulty breathing—please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have anyone who can help you get to and from the lab, or would you like me to see if we can arrange transportation for you?
PATIENT: Oh, no, that’s alright, Doctor. I can manage. I can take a taxi. I used to do everything myself, you know. I don’t want to be a bother. Thank you for being so kind. I feel a little bit better just talking to you. I’ll go do the tests now, then. Hopefully, they won’t find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McConnon. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. You’re not a bother at all. And I appreciate your independence. Please take your time, and don't hesitate to ask the lab technicians any questions you may have. I’ll look forward to seeing you again when the results are back. And remember, if anything changes, please contact us right away. Have a good day, Ms. McConnon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will.
