DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, primarily in my… I believe it’s my face, and perhaps my neck? It came on rather gradually, and I haven't been able to pinpoint a cause. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so recalling when it started is proving difficult.
DOCTOR: Gradually, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully. It’s… more noticeable now than it was, say, a week ago, perhaps? But even then, it wasn’t… alarming. Just… different. I apologize for the vagueness; I wish I could provide more specifics. Is it alright if I simply describe how it feels? It’s a bit… tight, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Tight. Right. Well, “tight” could mean a lot of things. Any pain associated with this tightness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain. It’s not… uncomfortable, exactly. More… a fullness, perhaps? A pressure, very mild. It’s… difficult to describe. I don’t feel sick, if that helps. No fever, no chills, no other symptoms that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any injuries to my face or neck recently, either. I truly wish I could remember when this began, or if anything specific triggered it. My apologies again for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just get through this. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s a good question. I… believe I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, but I haven’t taken much over the years. Perhaps a mild sensitivity to some antibiotics as a child, but nothing serious. I had a rash, I think, but it cleared up on its own. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I can provide the details if needed. I'm not entirely sure what I am allergic to, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not currently taking any medications. I don’t have any ongoing health conditions that require treatment, thankfully. Just… this swelling. It’s… unsettling, more than anything. It feels unusual, and I’d like to understand what’s causing it, if possible. I apologize for my lack of precise information; I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look then. Please lie back on the examination table. I need to check your neck for any… abnormalities.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, take your time. I hope you're able to determine the cause of the swelling. I’m a little anxious, naturally, but I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Feels… slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Not dramatically so, but present. Any recent infections?
PATIENT: Recent infections… No, not that I recall. I haven't been sick with a cold or the flu in… quite some time, actually. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, if that makes a difference. I haven’t traveled anywhere recently, either. Just… local activities. No sore throats, no earaches, no sinus issues. I suppose it’s possible I had a mild cold I didn’t even notice, but I really don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a difficult question. My mother… she passed away several years ago, and I wasn't particularly close to my father. I don't have a lot of information about their medical backgrounds, unfortunately. I believe my mother had some issues with… blood pressure, perhaps? But I'm not certain. And my father… I don't recall any significant illnesses on his side of the family. I apologize for being so vague; I wish I had more details to offer. It's been a long time, and my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it could be a minor infection, or… just swelling. I'll order a basic blood panel. It'll rule out anything serious. Come back in a week if it doesn't improve. Here's the lab requisition. Next.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. A week… alright. If it doesn’t improve… I appreciate you ordering the blood panel. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? Thank you again for your time, Doctor. .
