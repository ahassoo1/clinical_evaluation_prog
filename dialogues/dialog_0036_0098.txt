DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I ain’t really sick sick. Just…curious, I guess. I been workin’ on the boats a while now, and figured I should probably get a check-up. Never really had one before, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Demondre. It’s good you're being proactive about your health, even if you're not feeling actively ill. A preventative check-up is a great idea. I see here you’re 25 years old. Just to get a good overall picture, can you tell me a little bit about what your work on the boats involves?
PATIENT: Yeah, 25. Time flies, right? I’m a sailor and, uh… a marine oiler. Basically, I keep the engines runnin’ smooth. Lots of work with the machines, checkin’ levels, fixin’ things when they break… that kinda stuff. It can be pretty dirty work sometimes, lots of grease and… well, you get it. We go out for weeks at a time, too. It’s good money, but… it’s hard on the body, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound physically demanding. And being out on the water for extended periods presents its own set of challenges. Okay, let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. Never been told I had anythin’. I got divorced a few years back, that was rough, but besides that… pretty healthy, I think. I got Medicare, so I guess if somethin’ was wrong, they woulda told me by now? I don't really go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you haven’t had any major health issues diagnosed. And it’s true, Medicare would likely flag anything significant if it was detected during a previous visit. But sometimes things can go unnoticed, or develop over time. That's why a check-up now is a good idea. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Never had surgery. Broke my arm when I was a little kid, fell outta a tree, but the doctor just put a cast on it. That was it. Real simple stuff. I mostly just get aches and pains from the work, but nothin’ that a good night’s sleep don’t fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No surgeries or hospitalizations. That simplifies things. Let’s talk about your family. Do you know much about your parents' or siblings' medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a tough one. I didn’t grow up with my folks. My mama… she had some kinda trouble with her heart, I think. But I wasn’t around much, so I don’t really know the details. My brother, he’s okay, I guess. Works in a factory. I don't think he’s had any big problems either. We don’t talk much. It’s not a real close family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It's common to not have a lot of information about family history. Any information is helpful, but we can certainly proceed without detailed knowledge. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't smoke. Don’t really drink either. Had a few beers here and there, but nothin’ regular. And no, I don't use any… recreational drugs. Never really been my thing. Long days at work pretty much take care of anythin’ like that, you know? I’m usually pretty tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Just… water, mostly. I don't take nothin'. Sometimes I’ll take an ibuprofen if my back’s really hurtin’, but that’s about it. I try to eat alright, when I can. It’s hard on the boat, though. Lots of canned food. Not much fresh stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain, otherwise no regular medications. Alright. And just to finish up with the basics, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a real bad reaction to nothin’. Bees sting, I get a little puffy, but that's about it. I think I’m pretty lucky, honestly. Just wanna make sure I stay lucky. That's why I'm here!
DOCTOR: That's great to hear! And it sounds like you've been fortunate so far. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's gonna be… awkward or somethin’. I ain't real comfortable with doctors poking around too much, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Demondre. I will explain everything as I go and we can absolutely go at your pace. It will be a fairly standard exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking in your ears, and a quick look at your throat. I'll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. I'll be as gentle and respectful as possible. If you'd like, we can start with your blood pressure. Would you mind sitting up and extending your arm?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood pressure sounds good. Just…try not to squeeze too tight, alright? I got kinda small veins.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as careful as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/80. That's within the normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths. Sounds kinda echoey, don't it? Never really liked that part. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears. And finally, let’s take a look at your throat. Say “ah” for me.
PATIENT: Ah. Pretty sure my throat’s clear. I can yell real loud, if you need me to. Still kinda echoey, though. Is everything alright? You're lookin' real serious.
DOCTOR: Everything looks good. Your ears are clear, and your throat is clear as well. No signs of infection or inflammation. Just a bit of normal redness. And no, I wasn’t trying to be serious, just concentrating! Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Is there any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Nope, not there. Feels… normal. A little gurgly maybe? That’s just from lunch, I reckon. Had a can of beans. You can poke around a bit. Just don't push too hard, alright? Don't wanna mess up my insides.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little gurgling is perfectly normal after eating, especially with beans! I’m being as gentle as possible. Everything feels soft and non-tender. I don't feel any masses or abnormalities. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes. Relax your leg for me. And the other leg.
PATIENT: Okay. Relaxed. Always felt weird when people do that. Like my leg's gonna kick or somethin'. Everything okay? Still feelin' normal. Mostly just weird.
DOCTOR: Everything is normal. Your reflexes are intact and symmetrical. And yes, it does feel a little strange! It’s just a standard part of the exam to check your nervous system function. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything looks good! Your vital signs are normal, and I didn’t detect any abnormalities during the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you appear to be in good overall health. It sounds like you’ve been very lucky so far! I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy lifestyle - eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… good to hear. Real good. I kinda figured I was okay, but it’s good to have a doctor tell me that. Um… not really, I guess. Maybe… should I be worried about bein' on the boats all the time? Like, is the air bad or somethin’? Or the noise? That’s the only thing I really worry about, I think.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Demondre. Prolonged exposure to loud noises and potentially airborne particles on boats can have some health effects. The main concerns with long-term exposure to loud noise are hearing loss and tinnitus, or ringing in the ears. Also, depending on the type of engine and materials you're working with, there’s a potential for exposure to some airborne particles that could irritate your lungs over time. Do you wear any hearing protection while working on the boats?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. It’s kinda hard to hear what people’s sayin’ if I got earplugs in, and we need to be able to communicate. And the noise… you just kinda get used to it, I guess. It’s always been loud. Never really thought about it much, to be honest. Just figured it was part of the job.
DOCTOR: I understand. Communication is vital for safety. However, long-term, unaddressed noise exposure can lead to irreversible hearing loss. I strongly recommend considering some form of hearing protection, even if it's just for the loudest tasks. There are many different types available – earplugs, earmuffs, and even custom-fitted hearing protection designed for communication. Also, if possible, try to minimize your exposure to any airborne particles. Wearing a mask, even a simple N95 mask, during particularly dusty or smoky tasks could be helpful. I'm going to document your work environment in your chart and recommend that you discuss potential hearing protection options with your employer. I can provide you with some resources on hearing protection if you'd like. And, if you start to experience any hearing loss, tinnitus, or shortness of breath, please let me know immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, that'd be great. Resources on hearing protection, that sounds real helpful. I never thought about askin’ my employer about that, but… maybe I should. They gotta care about their workers, right? And… no, I think that's all for now. You answered everything I was worryin’ about. Thanks, Doctor. You're a real help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. Here’s a brochure with some information on different types of hearing protection, and a link to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website – they have a lot of resources on workplace safety. I’ve documented our conversation in your chart and provided the resources on hearing protection. I recommend a follow-up appointment in one year for a routine check-up. And please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any health concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Demondre. Stay safe out there on the water.
PATIENT: Nice meetin' you too, Doctor. I will. And thanks again for everything.
