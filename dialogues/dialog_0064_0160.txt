DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s this tiredness, you see? Just… dragging. And frankly, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know something's not right. Honestly, I don’t know why I’m even telling you this. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. It’s alright. We’ll figure things out. Don't worry about feeling embarrassed; I’m here to listen and help, no matter what. The tiredness… how long has that been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been…constant. And the dirt craving started around the same time, I think. Though I haven't been eating it every day, just when I feel…low. It’s not like I’m enjoying it, you understand. It just…happens. And I’ve always been a strong woman, you see? I don’t get tired. This isn’t normal for me.
DOCTOR: Six months of tiredness… and this craving that seems linked to feeling low. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the tiredness for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just sleepy, you see? It’s…everything feels heavy. Like I’m wading through mud. Getting out of a chair takes effort. Even talking feels tiring. And I have no energy for anything, not even gardening, which is ridiculous! I used to be able to work all day in the garden. Now… I just sit. It's like all my strength is just…gone. And the dirt... it’s just red clay, from the yard. Don't ask me why. I don’t know!
DOCTOR: Okay, a significant fatigue with a sense of heaviness, difficulty with even simple tasks…and this unusual craving for clay. You mentioned gardening – has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite’s been off. Not that I need much food at my age, but I haven’t been enjoying my meals. Everything tastes…bland. And I've been a bit more… irritable, I suppose. Snapping at people, which isn’t like me. Though frankly, people these days deserve a good snapping at sometimes. And… well, my skin feels dry, I suppose. It’s August, it’s always a bit dry, but… it seems worse this year. I don’t know if that’s related. Honestly, I just want to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. So, we have the fatigue, the clay craving, loss of appetite, some irritability, and dry skin. It sounds like several things are going on. To get a better picture, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing major, really. High blood pressure, years ago, but it's been under control with…well, I don't even remember the name of the pill anymore. And arthritis, of course. Everyone gets arthritis when they get old. But that’s just aches and pains. Nothing like this tiredness. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, truthfully. Didn’t see much point. They just tell you you're getting old. And honestly, I don't need anyone telling me that. I know I'm getting old. Just want this fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure and arthritis. And you said you haven't been to the doctor in years. Do you happen to know what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I just let the pharmacy handle all that. They send it to me every month. Little white pills, I think. Or maybe they were pink? Honestly, I don't pay attention. I just take what they give me. And I've been very good about taking my pills, so it's not like I've been skipping doses or anything. It just… doesn’t seem to be helping anymore, whatever it is. I wish I hadn't wasted my time coming here, if you're just going to ask me questions I can't answer.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember the specifics. We can look up your medication history. And it's good that you've been consistent with your medication. It's important information. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just my gallbladder, years ago. Back in… oh, I don't know, the 70s, maybe? It was a very simple procedure. Nothing complicated. They just took it out. And my bunions, but that was just a little thing. Local anesthetic, in and out in an hour. That’s it. I’ve always been very healthy, you see. Never had any serious illnesses. That’s why this is so…baffling. And frankly, a little alarming. I don’t like feeling weak.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and bunion surgery. Now, Candis, are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My mother had… diabetes, I think. Or maybe it was high blood pressure. She wasn’t very good about taking care of herself. Always complaining. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life. Died suddenly, heart attack, I think. That’s about it. We weren’t a very healthy family, honestly. Everyone smoked, drank too much… I was the healthy one. And now look at me. It's just…ridiculous. I’ve wasted a perfectly good afternoon sitting here. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, diabetes and a possible heart attack in your family. I understand your frustration, Candis. We’re getting there. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked. Tried it once, didn't like it. And I haven't had a drink in… well, decades. Not since my husband passed. No point, you see? Just makes everything sadder. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but…that was a long time ago. I spend most of my time in the garden, or reading. Used to, anyway. Now I just sit. It’s not much of a lifestyle, I suppose. And honestly, I don’t know what difference it makes. I’m still tired, still eating dirt… it’s just… hopeless.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Candis, have you had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
