DOCTOR: Hi Candis, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It's this tiredness. I’m just… worn out. And it’s not just regular tired, you know? It’s… deeper. Plus, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to be concerning, I guess. My daughter made me come here. She thinks it's a vitamin thing. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, I understand you're feeling quite tired and also experiencing something unusual with eating dirt. I appreciate you being honest about it – it's good to know everything that's going on. Let’s definitely figure this out. When you say “deeper” tired, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can just sleep it off. I get enough sleep, usually. Eight hours, like I always have. But I wake up just as exhausted as when I went to bed. It’s… draining. Like something is sucking the energy right out of me. And it’s been getting worse for… oh, maybe three months now? Hard to say exactly. Time just blends together these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so eight hours of sleep aren’t helping, and this has been going on for about three months, gradually worsening. You feel drained even after a full night’s rest. That's really helpful to know. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit… forgetful, I suppose. Not major things, just… where I put my glasses, what I was about to say, things like that. Though, at my age, you expect a little of that, don't you? And I haven't been eating much. Food just doesn’t taste good anymore. Everything feels… bland. No appetite really. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, both of those are important. Forgetfulness, and a decreased appetite are definitely things we need to look into. It’s good you mentioned them. Let’s talk about the dirt-eating a bit more. How often are you eating it, and about how much each time?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is just awful. Fine. It's not every day, thankfully. Maybe three or four times a week? And it’s not like I’m shoveling it in. Just… a mouthful. A little bit off the garden soil. It’s just… it feels good going down, okay? Like something my body needs. I know it’s weird. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you at all, Candis. It's my job to understand what's going on, and it’s helpful you’re being so open. It’s unusual, but it's important to figure out why you have this craving. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Really? Must we? Oh… alright. They’ve been… a little off. More… solid than usual. And a bit… darker, maybe? I don’t know, it's hard to explain. Just not normal, okay? I usually have no trouble, if you want to know. But lately, it's been… a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more solid, darker stools, and a bit more difficult to pass. That's good to know. We're gathering a lot of information here. Now, let's go over a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I had the flu, once, a long time ago. And my knees bother me, of course – from working as a physical therapist aide for so long. But nothing serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I don’t take any medications regularly. Just some ibuprofen for the knees when they really act up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, just knee pain treated with ibuprofen as needed. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I've always been lucky, I suppose. I’ve broken a bone or two as a child – fell out of a tree, that sort of thing – but nothing that needed a hospital visit or anything. Just a cast, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or major hospitalizations. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother lived to be 95, very healthy. My father died of a heart attack when he was 68. And my sister… well, she had some problems with her stomach a few years back, but I don't know all the details. She doesn't talk about it much. Honestly, we weren’t very close.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother healthy, father died of a heart attack, sister with some stomach issues. That's good to know. And lastly, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you want to know? I work, of course. Physical therapist aide, like I said. It’s… physical. I live alone. I garden, when I have the energy. I used to volunteer at the church, but… it’s hard to keep up with things these days. I eat… when I can. Mostly just simple things. I don't drink or smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, physical therapist aide, lives alone, gardens when able, used to volunteer, simple diet, no alcohol or tobacco. That’s very helpful. Okay, Candis, I'm just going to take a quick look at your record here… Hmm. No recent bloodwork. It looks like you haven't been to a doctor in quite a while. Given your symptoms – the tiredness, the dirt-eating, the decreased appetite, the changes in your bowel movements, and the forgetfulness – there are a few things we need to investigate. One possibility, given the dirt-eating specifically, is a possible iron deficiency, which can cause cravings for unusual things. However, there are other possibilities as well. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some bloodwork. We’ll check your iron levels, complete blood count, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin levels, including B12 and D. We'll also want to check your electrolytes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, bloodwork. Fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. Just… how long will it take? And I really don’t have time for a lot of back and forth. I have a patient appointment tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, I understand your concerns about time. The bloodwork itself shouldn't take long – about 15-20 minutes. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have the results sent directly to me, and I'll give you a call as soon as I have them. We can discuss the results and determine the next steps then. While we're waiting for the results, is there anything else you want to discuss or any other symptoms you've been experiencing that you haven't mentioned?
PATIENT: No. Honestly, I think that's it. I'm just tired. Really, really tired. And I just want to get back to normal. If this bloodwork doesn't find anything, I don’t know what I’m going to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. We’ll do everything we can to figure this out. Here's your lab requisition form. You can take this to any lab that accepts your insurance, or to the lab down the street. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. And just to be on the safe side, I'm going to recommend a stool sample as well. It can rule out any parasites or infections contributing to your symptoms. I'll give you a collection kit and instructions. In the meantime, try to eat a balanced diet, even if your appetite is low. And please, don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… let’s hope this works. I really don’t have time for this. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. You’re very welcome. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
