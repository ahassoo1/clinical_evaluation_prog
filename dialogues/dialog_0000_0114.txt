DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this breathing. It gets…difficult when I lie down. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I believe. Perhaps a month. I don’t like it one bit.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Roughly a month. It's not constant, you understand. Only when I'm…flat. Trying to sleep is the worst. I have to prop myself up with pillows, quite a few, actually. It’s very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Well, many things are. So, this difficulty breathing... is it more like you're short of breath, or is it a feeling of tightness in your chest?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not exactly short of breath, no. It’s more…a pressure. A heaviness. Right here, in my chest. It feels like something is sitting on me, pressing down. And it makes it hard to…well, to breathe deeply when I’m lying flat.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this pressure or heaviness radiate anywhere – your arm, your back, your neck, perhaps?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Yes, a little in my left arm. Not a sharp pain, you understand. More like…a dull ache. It’s not always there, just occasionally when the breathing feels particularly bad. And sometimes, a bit of discomfort in my neck too, at the back. Though, I do have a bit of trouble with my neck generally, to be honest. It’s from old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Old age. Yes. Well, let’s not dismiss anything. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Swelling? I hadn't really paid attention, no. I suppose…maybe a little, sometimes. But I thought that was just from being on my feet too long. I do a bit of work at the library, you know. Clerical work. It requires some standing. I wouldn’t say it's significant swelling, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any cough?
PATIENT: No, not a cough. I haven’t coughed in…well, I can't remember when. Perfectly healthy lungs, usually. Though, I did have a bit of a cold last winter, but that’s neither here nor there. This breathing trouble is different. It's…specifically when I lie down. That’s what’s bothering me. And I’d like to get it sorted, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Perfectly healthy lungs… well, we’ll see about that. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any heart problems, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, never. I’ve always been quite…sturdy, actually. My doctor back home – Dr. Hemlock, lovely man – always said I had a strong heart. Regular check-ups, you understand. Nothing ever flagged. Though, it has been a few years since I moved here. And Dr. Hemlock... he retired, you see. That was before I relocated. I do hope this isn't something serious. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… Dr. Hemlock mentioned it once, I believe. Said it was a little elevated. He put me on a…a small tablet. For a while. I stopped taking it after a year or so. It didn’t seem to make much difference. As for diabetes, no. Never. I eat quite healthily, actually. Lots of vegetables. Are you thinking it could be my heart? I really don’t want to end up in a hospital.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Vanderwiele, it's too early to say definitively. But given your symptoms – the breathing difficulty when lying flat, the slight swelling, the history of mildly elevated blood pressure – we need to investigate. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs now, if you don’t mind. Then, I’ll need to order some tests. A chest X-ray, an EKG, and some blood work. Routine things, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Please lie back for me.
PATIENT: Oh. Tests. Very well. I suppose that’s necessary. Though, I do wish it wasn’t. I hope it won’t take too long. I have arrangements to make this afternoon. And please, be gentle. My ribs are rather…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Deep breaths, if you can. Your heart sounds a little…distant. And your breathing is slightly wheezy on the left side. Not alarming, but something we need to look into further. I'll order those tests now. The nurse will be in to draw your blood and get the EKG done shortly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather robust, as I said. Robust, but not invincible, apparently. Will the nurse explain what I need to do for the tests? I don't like surprises. And how long will it take to get the results? I have to plan my week.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain everything. The blood work is fairly straightforward, and the EKG is quick and painless. As for results… typically a few days. But it depends on the lab’s workload. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them once they're back. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath that doesn't improve with rest, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness…emergency room. I certainly don’t want to end up in the emergency room. I'd like to be clear. How likely is it that this is something…serious? Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. I prefer to know what I’m facing. And can I still do light gardening while we wait for the results? It keeps me occupied.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, it’s impossible to say with certainty at this stage. Your symptoms could be indicative of several things, some more serious than others. Congestive heart failure is a possibility, as is a lung condition. But it could also be something less concerning. That’s why we need these tests. As for gardening… I would advise against any strenuous activity until we have the results back. Light, gentle activity is probably fine, but avoid anything that makes you breathless or causes chest discomfort. We need to rule out anything that could put undue strain on your heart. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. No strenuous activity. Light gardening only. And…wait for the results. It’s…disconcerting. To think something might be wrong with my heart. I always prided myself on my good health. Is there anything else I should be looking out for? Besides the chest pain and shortness of breath, of course. Any subtle signs?
DOCTOR: Well, pay attention to any unusual fatigue – feeling more tired than usual, even with adequate rest. Also, keep an eye out for swelling in your legs and ankles, especially at the end of the day. And if you notice your urine output decreasing, that could be a sign of fluid retention. Are you experiencing any palpitations – a feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: Palpitations… No, I don’t think so. My heart feels…steady, usually. Perhaps a bit distant, as you said, but not racing. Fatigue…I suppose I have been a little more tired lately. But I attributed that to my age. And the swelling in my ankles…perhaps a little, as I mentioned before. It’s all rather vague, isn't it? Very well. I’ll pay attention to everything you’ve said. No strenuous activity, watch for fatigue and swelling, and…be vigilant. I suppose there’s nothing more to be done for now but wait. When will the nurse be in? I’d like to get this over with, if possible.
DOCTOR: The nurse should be in within the next few minutes. She'll explain the procedure for the blood draw and the EKG. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. We'll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's likely nothing too serious, but it’s best to be thorough. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. I believe that covers everything. I’ll wait for the nurse. And Doctor…thank you. Despite your…lack of optimism, I appreciate you taking the time to listen. .
