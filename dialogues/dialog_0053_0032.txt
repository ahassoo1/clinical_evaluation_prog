DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's… rather embarrassing, actually. An… issue has arisen. A most unpleasant issue, down there. I haven't… experienced anything like this in decades, not since my youth, certainly. It’s a… discharge. Yes, a discharge. It's quite bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. She has a rather… practical nature, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. Well, these things happen, even to those of… your generation. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in; better to get it checked. Now, can you describe this discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Goodness. Well, it's… not exactly watery, if that makes any sense. More… viscous. And yellowish, I suppose. Though honestly, I haven't been examining it closely. I left that to my wife, initially. She’s quite capable, you understand. And there's a… slight odor. Not dreadful, but… present. It began, oh, perhaps a week ago? Or was it ten days? Time rather slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Viscous, yellowish, with a slight odor… and it’s been roughly a week to ten days. Alright. And is there any pain, burning, itching, or any other discomfort associated with this?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… a little tenderness, perhaps. Not a sharp pain, mind you, but… sensitivity. Especially when… when I relieve myself. And… yes, a slight burning sensation afterward. It’s not debilitating, of course, but it’s… noticeable. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always prided myself on my… constitution. This is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Tenderness and slight burning after urination. It is good you came in. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or any other symptoms, like lower abdominal pain, or feeling like you need to urinate more frequently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I haven't been feeling unwell in that regard. Chills… no, it’s been quite warm lately, haven’t you noticed? And abdominal pain… no, not at all. I haven't needed to… rush to the facilities any more than usual. Though, now that you mention it, my appetite has been a bit off. But I attribute that to the summer heat. It plays havoc with the digestion, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, the heat. Of course. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… well, I’ve always been a robust fellow. Heart problems, no. Diabetes, thankfully not. I did have a bout of… shingles, a few years back. Quite painful, that was. And I’ve had the usual aches and pains of advancing age, naturally. But nothing… serious. My wife handles all the paperwork, you see. She’s very diligent. I believe she mentioned something about high blood pressure at one point? It comes and goes, she says.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… alright. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, a hernia repair, quite a long time ago. Perhaps forty years ago? It was… routine, really. And I had my appendix removed in my youth, during the war. A rather unpleasant experience, if I recall correctly. Other than that… no, I believe that’s it. My wife keeps a very thorough record, of course. She always has. I'm rather hopeless with such things.
DOCTOR: Right. Hernia repair, appendectomy… let’s see here… Okay, I see some records here. High blood pressure, as you mentioned, and… mild cholesterol issues. And you are currently taking… amlodipine and atorvastatin, is that correct?
PATIENT: Amlodipine and… atorvastatin? Yes, yes, those rings a bell. My wife ensures I take my medications religiously. She has a chart, you see, with the times and dosages. Very organized, she is. I simply follow her instructions. I wouldn't dream of deviating from the regimen. It’s… reassuring, to have her manage these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Now that you ask… I do believe I had a slight reaction to penicillin once, many years ago. A rash, I think. Nothing serious, but my wife has made a note of it, naturally. She's very cautious, you see. Always thinking ahead. I’ve avoided penicillin ever since, on her advice. A sensible precaution, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Penicillin allergy. Now, Mr. Krok, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a simple check to assess the situation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well, I suppose it's unavoidable. Though, honestly, Doctor, I'm not entirely comfortable with… such examinations at my age. It’s… a matter of modesty, you understand. But if it’s necessary for a diagnosis, then I shall cooperate. Though, please be… gentle. And as discreet as possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Completely discreet and as comfortable as possible. I understand. Now, if you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll need to examine your abdomen and, yes, the area of concern. I’ll explain everything as I go. Let's begin with the abdomen.
PATIENT: Very well. Please do be quick about it, Doctor. And, as I said, gentle. This is… a rather delicate matter. My wife will be most upset if I return home in any discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, no significant tenderness. Now, I'm just going to have a quick look at the area of concern. Please try to relax. I see some inflammation and discharge, consistent with a possible infection. The skin is a little irritated. It doesn’t appear to be anything overly serious at this stage, but we need to confirm with some tests. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a culture to identify any bacteria present. We'll also check for sexually transmitted infections as a precaution. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… a urine analysis and… a culture. And tests for… those things? Well, I suppose it’s unavoidable if that’s what’s required for a proper diagnosis. Though, honestly, Doctor, I haven't been… active in that regard for decades. My wife will be most displeased to hear about this. But if you insist, then very well. Just please be as discreet as possible. And as quick as possible. I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Tests ordered. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a sample. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Krok. And frankly, even with a long period of inactivity, it's still important to rule out all possibilities. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic, just to cover the potential infection. It’s a precaution, and we can adjust the medication once we have the culture results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An antibiotic… yes, I suppose that’s sensible. Something to… quell the discomfort, at least. Though, honestly, Doctor, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. My wife makes a lovely chamomile tea, you know. Very soothing. But if you insist it’s necessary, then very well. Just… please ensure it doesn't interact with my other medications. And tell me what to expect in terms of… side effects. I wouldn’t want to be incapacitated. I have roses to prune, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I’m prescribing amoxicillin, which has minimal interactions with your current medications, as far as I can tell. Possible side effects are mild nausea or diarrhea, but they are rare. If you experience anything more severe, stop taking the medication and contact the office immediately. Here’s the prescription. The nurse will also give you instructions on dosage and how to take it. I want you to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. And please, follow up with me in a week to discuss the results of the tests. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… yes, I see. Dosage and instructions… I suppose I should ask my wife to review this as well. She’s much more diligent than I am when it comes to these things. One question, Doctor. Is… is this something I should be concerned about? Something… serious? And will it… affect my gardening?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Krok, it's likely a simple infection. These things happen. It's not usually serious, especially if we catch it early. The antibiotics should clear it up quickly. And no, it shouldn’t affect your gardening, as long as you stay hydrated and take the medication as prescribed. Now, if you have no other questions, I think we’re all set for today. The nurse will be in shortly to collect your sample and provide you with discharge instructions. Have a good day, Mr. Krok. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall attempt to follow your instructions, and consult with my wife. And I shall endeavor not to worry. Though it’s difficult, you understand. A man’s garden is his sanctuary. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And… please extend your apologies to the nurse. I’m afraid I’m rather… squeamish. .
DOCTOR: Right. You’re welcome. Goodbye, Mr. Krok.
