DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you as well. I’m Dondre. I’ve been having trouble… emptying my bladder, mostly. It just… doesn't all come out at once, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Dondre. It sounds frustrating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It's been getting worse for maybe… a month or so now? At first it wasn’t so bad, just a little bit of straining. But lately it’s… harder. And I gotta go back to the bathroom pretty soon after I think I’m done. It’s been… a bother, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A month of increasing difficulty and needing to return to the bathroom frequently – that certainly sounds bothersome. And straining is something we want to pay attention to. Besides the incomplete emptying and the frequent returns, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I feel like I gotta push a little harder than I used to, even before I realize I didn't empty everything. And… sometimes, just a little dribble comes out when I stand up after sitting for a bit. Not a lot, but enough to… well, you know. It’s embarrassing. I don’t think that happened before.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be quite embarrassing, Dondre. Thank you for sharing that with me. The increased effort to start the stream and the dribbling after sitting are helpful details. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, not really. No burning or pain. It just… doesn't feel right, you know? Like something is still in there. And it’s not a sharp pain, if that makes sense. Just a… fullness. A pressure, I guess. Not constant, but when I try to go.
DOCTOR: That’s a good way to describe it – a sensation of fullness or pressure. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, that sort of thing. But nothing serious. My wife… she was the one with the problems. Heart trouble, mostly. She passed away about two years ago. I've mostly been healthy, knock on wood. I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Dondre. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It’s good to know you’ve been generally healthy. And yes, Medicare is helpful information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than those childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And I haven't been in the hospital since I was a little boy with a bad case of pneumonia. That was… a long time ago. I've been lucky, I suppose. Mostly just kept busy with work. I’m a shoe machine operator, down at the factory. Been doing that for… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been relatively healthy, Dondre. And thank you for sharing about your work. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother's side, they had a lot of… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had some trouble with his blood pressure when he got older. But mostly, they just… got old. We didn't really talk about medical things much, back then. It wasn't something we focused on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Dondre. It's not uncommon for families to not discuss medical history openly. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I don't take anything regularly. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I mostly just drink water, and try to get enough sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife… she was allergic to some kinds of shellfish, I think. But I can eat whatever I want. I've always had a pretty strong stomach, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Dondre, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and sensation. Then, I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam – that means I will check your prostate gland. It’s important to assess the size and consistency of your prostate, as it can sometimes cause urinary symptoms. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? I… well, I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I understand you need to find out what’s going on, but… it sounds a little… unpleasant. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dondre. It is a sensitive exam, and it’s perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable about it. However, a digital rectal exam is the best way to assess the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate gland, which is a common cause of the symptoms you’re experiencing. It helps us rule out other possibilities as well. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but they wouldn't be as accurate. We could order a PSA blood test, which measures a protein produced by the prostate, but it doesn't give us as much information about the gland itself. Or we could consider an ultrasound, but that requires a full bladder, which isn't ideal in your case. Ultimately, the decision is yours. I want you to be comfortable. However, I strongly recommend the exam to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I assure you I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We can stop at any time if you are uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright… if it’s really the best way to find out what’s going on… then I suppose I’ll do it. But… could you explain it to me first? Like… what exactly will you be doing? And… will it hurt? I’m a little nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Dondre. I completely understand your nervousness. Let me explain the procedure. First, you’ll lie on your side, usually your left side, with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricant on a gloved, finger to gently insert it into your rectum. It's similar to how a doctor might check you during a routine exam. I'll be feeling the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. I’ll also be checking for any tenderness or irregularities. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel some pressure or a sensation of needing to have a bowel movement. It's a very quick exam, usually just a few seconds. I will let you know when we are done. I’ll be explaining everything as I go and will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. You can also tell me to stop at any time. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A few seconds, you say? And I can tell you to stop whenever I want? That… that makes me feel a little better. I guess it’s just… it’s a private thing, you know? And… I’ve never had anyone touch me there before. But… if it’s the best way to figure out what’s going on… then okay. Let's… let's get it over with. But please, be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing as you go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I completely understand. It is a very private exam, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. I will explain everything as I go and will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Alright. If you could lie down on your side with your knees bent, we’ll get started. I’ll just step out to prepare the lubricant and gloves. I’ll be right back, and we’ll take it slowly. Do you have any questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I’m ready. Just… please, be quick. And tell me what you’re doing. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dondre. I’m back. As I mentioned, I’m going to use a small amount of lubricant on my gloved finger to gently insert it into your rectum. I'll be feeling for the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It might feel like a brief pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just relax, and breathe normally. I’m applying a little lubricant now… and gently inserting my finger… Okay, I'm feeling your prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged, and a little firm. There are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort?
PATIENT: It… it feels a little strange. A little uncomfortable, but… not painful. Just… pressure. And… a bit of an urge, like I need to go to the bathroom. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal, Dondre. The urge to have a bowel movement is very common during this exam. It’s just your body’s natural response. Just try to relax your muscles, and breathe normally. I’m almost finished now. Okay, all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… over? Good. It wasn't as bad as I thought, but… I’m glad it’s done. It was… uncomfortable. And a little embarrassing, to be honest. What did you find? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s over, Dondre. You did great. It’s completely understandable that it was uncomfortable and a little embarrassing. As I mentioned, your prostate feels slightly enlarged and firm. It’s not drastically enlarged, but it is larger than what I’d typically expect. It also feels a little firm to the touch, which could indicate some inflammation or early changes. There were no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness, which is good. Based on this exam, I suspect you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That means your prostate is enlarged, which can cause urinary symptoms like difficulty emptying your bladder, frequent urination, and a weak stream. It's very common as men get older. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a more accurate diagnosis, I recommend a few further tests. I'd like to order a PSA blood test, which measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate. I also recommend a urinalysis to check for any infection or other abnormalities. We might also consider an ultrasound of your bladder and prostate to get a more detailed image. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: BPH… that’s… an enlarged prostate? Like… it’s getting bigger? And that’s why I can’t empty my bladder? A blood test and a… what did you call it… a urinalysis? And maybe an… ultrasound? That sounds like a lot of tests. Is it… serious? Is it… cancer?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Dondre. Let’s address your concerns one by one. Yes, BPH means your prostate gland is enlarged. It's a very common condition as men age, and in many cases, it’s not serious. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, it just means the gland is getting bigger, which can press on the urethra and cause urinary symptoms. The tests I’m recommending are to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The PSA blood test will help us assess your risk for prostate cancer, but it’s important to remember that an elevated PSA level doesn't always mean you have cancer. It can be elevated for other reasons, like inflammation or infection. The urinalysis will check for any infection or abnormalities in your urine. And the ultrasound will give us a more detailed image of your bladder and prostate. It’s important to be proactive and get these tests done so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and develop the best treatment plan for you. Based on the information we have now, I don’t believe it’s cancer, but we need to rule it out with further testing. I want to assure you that we will take every step necessary to get an accurate diagnosis and provide you with the best possible care. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. So, the blood test and the urine test… those are to make sure it’s not cancer? And the… ultrasound is just to see what’s going on inside? Is there… a lot I need to do to prepare for these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out. It’s been worrying me a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to get this sorted out, Dondre. And yes, the blood test and urine test are to help rule out any infection and assess your risk for prostate cancer. The ultrasound will give us a clearer picture of the size and shape of your prostate and bladder, and help us see if there are any other abnormalities. Preparation for these tests is relatively simple. For the blood test, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drink except water. For the urinalysis, you’ll need to provide a urine sample first thing in the morning. We’ll give you a sterile cup and instructions on how to collect the sample. For the ultrasound, you’ll need to drink a certain amount of water before the appointment to fill your bladder. The technician will give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week for the blood test results to come back. The urinalysis results are usually available within a day or two. The ultrasound results may take a bit longer, depending on the availability of the radiologist. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about any of these tests or the follow-up process?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Fast for 8 hours, give a urine sample, drink water for the ultrasound… and then we’ll talk about the results. Okay. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I was really worried, but I feel a little bit better now that I know what’s going on. Can we… can we schedule those tests now? Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things, and I want you to know I’m here to support you every step of the way. Absolutely, let’s get those tests scheduled right away. Okay, let me see… we can schedule the blood test for Thursday morning at 8:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday morning… yes, that works fine. 8:00 AM is good. Let’s do that. And what about the urine sample? And the… ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thursday at 8:00 AM for the blood test is scheduled. For the urine sample, you can come in any time in the morning before your blood test, but it’s best to do it right before to ensure the sample is fresh. Just let the receptionist know you're here for a pre-blood test urine sample. Now, let's schedule the ultrasound. We have availability next Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… 2:00 PM is fine. Yes, let's do that. So, Thursday at 8:00 AM for the blood test, and Tuesday at 2:00 PM for the… ultrasound. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. You've got it right – Thursday at 8:00 AM for the blood test and Tuesday at 2:00 PM for the ultrasound. As for paperwork, the receptionist will give you a consent form for the blood test and the ultrasound. Just review it and sign it when you arrive. She'll also verify your insurance information. Do you have any questions about the fasting requirements for the blood test, or anything else before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. No food after… what time was it? 8 hours before? I can handle that. Just no food. And sign a few papers. Well, thank you again, Doctor Vodzak. I appreciate your patience and your help. I’ll see you after the tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. Yes, no food after midnight the night before your blood test. And just drink plenty of water. I’m glad I could help. I’ll see you after the tests, and we’ll discuss the results then. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. Have a good day! .
