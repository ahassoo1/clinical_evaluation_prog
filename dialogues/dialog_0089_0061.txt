DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Oh, right! The tryouts. For the... the team. My boy, he signed me up. Said I gotta get checked out first. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Team tryouts, alright. That’s good your son is looking out for you. And yes, old bones sometimes need a little check-up! Just to be safe. So, can you tell me a little more about what team you’re trying out for, and what sort of activities the tryouts involve?
PATIENT: Activities? Oh, goodness. He just said “team.” And running… and throwing, I think? Something with a ball. He's very excited, my boy. Always was… full of energy. It’s a… a local team, I believe. Down by the… the park? I don’t remember the name, sorry. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Murph. Perfectly understandable. Running and throwing… okay, so some physical exertion involved. Have you been doing any running or throwing recently, to prepare?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmm… Well, I walk. Every day. To the store, mostly. And… I try to help my grandson with his baseball sometimes. Throwing the ball back to him, gentle throws, of course. But “training”? No, not really. It’s been… a long time since I really trained.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular walking and some light throwing. That’s good. Now, have you noticed any pain, discomfort, or shortness of breath while walking or doing those light throws?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. A little ache in my knees, mostly when it’s cold. And… sometimes I get a little winded. Not too bad, though. Just gotta catch my breath. It happens. Old age, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, those things can happen. The knee pain is not unusual, and a little shortness of breath can be expected. Just to get a clearer picture, Mr. Murph, can you describe the knee pain?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s… a dull ache, like a weight on them. More when I start walking, or if I walk up a hill. It usually goes away after a bit. Not sharp, not too bad. And it’s both knees, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, both knees, dull ache, worse with starting and hills. Do you have any history of arthritis, or has anyone in your family had problems with their joints?
PATIENT: Arthritis… I don’t think so. Doctor never said anything about it. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands when she got older. Swollen up and stiff, I remember. But I don't know what it was, exactly. Just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be perfect. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear, but there's some diminished breath sounds in the bases. Now, let’s check your knees. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there… yes, when you press. Not sharp, just… a dull ache, like you said.
DOCTOR: There’s mild tenderness on the medial aspect of both knees, with some crepitus—that’s a slight grating sensation—when you bend them. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no significant swelling or instability. Okay, Mr. Murph. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees. This is common with age and activity. The murmur I heard is also something to keep an eye on. I want to do a few blood tests just to rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. Is something wrong? Arthritis… I’ve heard of that. My mother had that, I think. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Mr. Murph. The blood tests are just to get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities. Osteoarthritis isn't necessarily "bad," but it can cause discomfort. It’s very manageable with the right approach. The blood tests will help us determine the extent of the arthritis and check for any other conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We'll check your basic inflammatory markers and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Inflammatory… markers? Oh, goodness. Sounds complicated. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. Do what you think is best. I just want to be able to… well, just be able to keep moving, you know?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Murph. That’s our goal. I'll order those blood tests for you. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that cause significant pain. Gentle exercise, like walking, is good, but listen to your body. To be on the safe side, given the murmur and your age, I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG? More tests… oh, goodness. My heart rhythm? Is something wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, please try not to worry. The murmur I heard is not necessarily a sign of something serious, but the EKG is a simple test that will give us more information. It's a precaution, just to be thorough. It’s a quick and painless test, and it will help me determine if any further cardiac evaluation is needed. Would you like me to explain what the test involves?
PATIENT: Explain it? Yes, please. Just tell me what they're going to do. I get nervous easily, you know? Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Murph. Absolutely. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a very simple test. A technician will place small, sticky pads—electrodes—on your chest, arms, and legs. These pads are connected to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all – you won’t feel anything. It takes just a few minutes, and then I'll review the results. The technician will explain everything before they begin. Does that sound a little less daunting?
PATIENT: Sticky pads… and they record my heart? Oh, goodness. A few minutes, you say? Alright… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And as long as you think it’s important. Yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mr. Murph. I'll have the technician come in and get you set up. Once we have both the blood test and EKG results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to help you stay active and feel your best. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before I call the technician?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… try to remember not to do too much. That’s what my wife always says. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It helps.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Murph. I always try to explain things as clearly as possible. And I will certainly remember to take things slowly with you. Let me just call for the technician now. "Technician to examination room three, please."
PATIENT: .
