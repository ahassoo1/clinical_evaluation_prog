DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um, well, I have been... coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come get it checked. It's not a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. That definitely warrants a check-up. Coughing up blood – we call that hemoptysis – is something we need to investigate. Just to clarify, when you say “some blood,” can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, I am sorry. Hemop... what did you call it? I don't understand the big words. But, yes. It is not like, a lot pouring out. More like... streaks. Red streaks in my spit when I cough. Sometimes it happens just once or twice, then it stops for a little while. It’s been happening for maybe… a week now? I am not very good at keeping track of dates. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly okay. A week is helpful. And don't worry about the medical terms – I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. Streaks of blood, you said, not a large amount. Has anything specific triggered the coughing episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I have noticed. I don't think so. I have been trying to remember if it happens more when I exercise, but I walk every day, and it seems to happen randomly. Sometimes when I first wake up, sometimes in the afternoon… It doesn’t feel different than a normal cough, just… the blood. And I haven't been sick with a cold or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated illness, and it seems to happen sporadically regardless of activity. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the coughing?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have been a little tired, maybe. But I am always a little tired, to be honest. My husband… he passed away last year, and things have been difficult. I don’t know if that is related. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little short of breath, but again, it could just be from walking. It’s hard to say. I do not have a fever or any chills. No chest pain either.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jeannemarie. Grief can certainly take a toll on your body, and it’s good you’re recognizing that. It's important to rule out anything else going on, though. So, no fever, no chest pain, just fatigue and occasional shortness of breath in addition to the coughing up blood. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Please ask. Um… no, I don’t think so. I have not been to a doctor in many years, since my husband always took care of those things. He said I was very healthy. I did have a bad flu once, a long time ago, but I don't think that counts as a condition. I have never been told I have asthma or anything like that. And I don’t smoke, if that is important.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the smoking. And it’s helpful to hear you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I was in the hospital when I had my son, of course. But other than that, no. I have been very lucky, I think. I have always been healthy. Until this cough, anyway. It is a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and delivery of your son – otherwise, no significant surgical history. Now, regarding your family history - are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like lung disease, bleeding disorders, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some kind of heart trouble when he was older. But I don’t think anyone in my family ever had lung problems or cancer. My brother is very healthy, and my sister… she passed away a few years ago, but she didn’t have any serious illnesses either. I am not sure if that helps. I don't really know much about my family's medical history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Jeannemarie. It’s good you shared what you know. Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I do not like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Just sometimes I take something for a headache, if it is very bad, but not regularly. I prefer to rest and drink water. That usually helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly fine. Please do what you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I am a little nervous, but I know you are trying to help me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower right side. Not significantly, but I do notice it. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 138/85, and your heart rate is normal. Now, let’s take a look at your throat. Your throat looks clear, no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Now I want to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen levels are 96%, which is good.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… a little worrying, about my breathing being diminished. What does that mean? Is it serious? And my blood pressure is high? I have never had that before.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking questions, Jeannemarie. "Diminished" simply means the sound of airflow is a bit quieter in that area of your lung. It could be due to a number of things – sometimes it’s nothing serious, but it warrants further investigation. And yes, your blood pressure is a little elevated. It's not drastically high, but we'll want to monitor it. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The X-ray will help us see if there’s any inflammation or blockage in your lungs, and the CBC will check for signs of infection or anemia. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help find out what is wrong, then yes, please do those tests. I want to know what is causing this cough. I am a little scared, but I trust you, Doctor. Where will I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Jeannemarie. I’m glad you feel comfortable with that. You can have those tests done right here at the clinic. We have an X-ray machine and a lab on site. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood draw will be quick as well. It usually takes about an hour for the results to come back. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to ask you to try and avoid strenuous activity. If the coughing gets worse or you develop a fever, please call us immediately. And just to be safe, I'll write you a prescription for a mild cough suppressant to help manage the symptoms while we figure out what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. A cough suppressant would be nice. I will try to rest and take it easy. And I will call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we are doing something to find out what is wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Let me just write that prescription for you now. Here you go. And the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your X-ray. We'll go over the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you very much, Doctor Annesley. You have been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. It was my pleasure. Take care, and I'll see you shortly with the results. .
