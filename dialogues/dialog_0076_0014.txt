DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, yes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s me. Ronnald. Good to meet you, Doctor… Ruocco, is it? Seems like a nice place you got here. I… well, I’m here about some papers. My wife, she said I need something for work. Something about… time off? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I’m not quite sure what it’s called.
DOCTOR: Papers. Right. Well, let's try to sort this out. “Time off,” you say. So, something is preventing you from working as usual?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Preventing… yes. It’s… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like a broken leg or anything. More like… things just aren't right. I get tired easily, and my memory… well, you probably saw that already. It's been getting worse, and work… work is getting tricky. I keep forgetting things during meetings, important things. It's embarrassing. I’m a director, you know, religious activities and education… need to keep my head on straight for that.
DOCTOR: Director… alright. Tired easily and memory issues. How long has this been going on, this… not feeling right?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. It’s been… gradual, you see? Maybe six months? A little longer? It started with just feeling a bit more worn out than usual, then little things started slipping my mind. Dates, names… Now it’s… well, like I said, embarrassing. My wife keeps having to remind me of things. She’s a good woman, bless her. She’s the one who made the appointment, actually. She said I needed to get it checked out and get some paperwork for… FMLA, I think she called it?
DOCTOR: FMLA. Right, paperwork. Six months… and it's been getting progressively worse. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No pain, no dizziness. Sometimes I feel a bit… foggy, like I’m looking through a cloud. And I haven’t been sleeping as well. I wake up a lot during the night. But that could just be old age, I suppose! I’m 67, you know. Things start to… go a bit wonky when you get to my age. Though my wife says it’s more than just old age. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Foggy, trouble sleeping… Alright. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. No, not really. I still enjoy my food, thankfully. My wife makes a lovely poisson cru, you know? Though… now that I think about it, I haven’t been as hungry lately. Just not the same appetite as before, maybe? But I figured that was just because I haven’t been feeling well. It’s hard to enjoy a good meal when you’re tired and foggy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… let me see. Nothing major, thankfully. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a pill for that. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. But that was ages ago! Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I always ate good food, you know? And I try to stay active, though it’s getting harder with the tiredness. My wife says I should slow down, but I like to keep busy.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication. Appendix removed. Anything in the family that runs common?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some problems with her memory towards the end, but I don’t know what it was exactly. Just… forgetting things, like I am now. And my father, he had heart trouble. But other than that… not that I know of. We didn't really talk about medical things much, you know? Tahiti is a small island, and we didn’t see doctors very often. We mostly just… got on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about drinking, smoking, or any other… habits?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no smoking! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes. Very little. Just a glass or two. Nothing that would cause trouble, I assure you. I'm a pretty healthy man, all things considered. My wife always says I take after my grandfather, who lived to be 95!
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Nothing major. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not very good with medical things, you see? And please, don’t rush me. Sometimes it takes me a moment to… get my bearings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, sit up straight. Heart sounds… a little irregular, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Today’s date… let me think. It's… August, isn't it? August… the 2nd? Yes, I think it’s the 2nd. 2025, right? My wife told me this morning. I sometimes get the dates mixed up, you see. Especially the days of the week.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh, three words? Yes. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll do my best. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll try my hardest.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Now, I’ll ask you to remember those. Let’s move on for now, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. Now, please stand up and try to balance on one foot for ten seconds. Don't worry if you wobble a bit.
PATIENT: Oh, balancing… yes. Right. Oh, goodness! That's… not as easy as it looks. I used to be very good at balancing. But I feel a little unsteady today. Maybe it's the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Alright. Okay. Now, let's finish with recalling those three words. Apple, table, penny. What were those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm. Let me think. Apple… and… Oh dear, this is embarrassing. I know I heard them, but they just won’t come to me. Table… no, that doesn’t sound right. And… penny? No. I’m so sorry, Doctor. My mind is just… a blank. I really wish I could remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive decline. The memory issues, balance problems, and difficulty recalling words are concerning. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. And I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. We can discuss the results in about a week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Cognitive decline… That sounds… serious. A neurologist… yes, if you think it’s necessary. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood work… yes, that’s fine. A week… yes, that gives me time to… well, to try and remember things, I suppose. My wife will be glad you’re taking this seriously. She's been worried about me for months. And the papers… about the time off?
DOCTOR: Yes, the FMLA paperwork. I can have my nurse prepare a temporary disability claim form for you. It will require your signature and the signature of your employer. As for the time off, we’ll need to see what the neurologist says. It's difficult to determine the extent of your limitations at this point. I’ll also give you a list of resources for cognitive health and support groups in the area. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful about the papers, thank you. Support groups… yes, that might be helpful. My wife would definitely appreciate that. Hmm… questions? Let me think. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Though… will this affect my ability to… direct things? The religious activities? It’s important work, you know. I don’t want to let anyone down.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively. It depends on the severity of the condition and how it progresses. We need to get a proper diagnosis first. For now, I recommend you avoid any activities that require significant cognitive effort or could put you in a dangerous situation. And please, let your wife assist you with anything you find difficult. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment and provide you with the necessary paperwork and resources. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Avoid…significant effort. My wife… she does help a lot. But I like to be independent, you see? I don’t want to be a burden. Will this… get worse? Is there anything I can do to slow it down? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Limtiaco, there's no easy answer to that. Cognitive decline can progress at different rates for everyone. As for slowing it down, maintaining a healthy lifestyle – diet, exercise, social engagement – is always beneficial. We'll have a more detailed discussion after the neurologist’s evaluation. For now, let’s focus on getting you the help you need and exploring all available options. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and contact information. Do not attempt to drive yourself home. Have your wife pick you up. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I… I think that’s all. Drive… yes, my wife will pick me up. Thank you, Doctor. Even if… even if it’s not good news, thank you for listening. It’s just… scary, you know? To feel your mind… slipping away.
DOCTOR: Yes. Well. My nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
