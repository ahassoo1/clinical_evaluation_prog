DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 60 years of age. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, sixty years old, that is correct. I am here because... there is liquid coming from my ear. It is… discharging, you could say. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Discharge, you say. A few days ago. Alright. And is it…constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not all the time. Sometimes it is more, sometimes it is less. When I lie down on my right side, it feels… wetter, if you understand. But when I am sitting, or standing, it is not so much.
DOCTOR: "Wetter" when lying on your right side… yes, I believe I understand. Is there any pain associated with this discharge, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. A little… uncomfortable, maybe. Like pressure, sometimes. Not a sharp pain, never. Just… not right. It feels blocked, a little. Like something is inside.
DOCTOR: No sharp pain, just discomfort and a feeling of blockage. Has your hearing been affected at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little. Not much, but… sounds are not as clear on that side, the right side. Like someone is… muffling them, if you know what I mean? It is not a big change, but I notice it. Especially when people speak softly.
DOCTOR: I see. A muffling sensation, primarily when people speak softly. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or any dizziness alongside this discharge and hearing difficulty?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And no dizziness. I feel… normal, mostly. Just this ear. It is the only problem. I have been trying to keep it dry, but it is difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you attempted to treat it yourself at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I used… cotton. To clean it. And I put a small drop of olive oil in there, a few days ago. My mother always said olive oil is good for many things. But it did not… help much. It felt better for a short time, maybe, but then it was the same again.
DOCTOR: Olive oil... Well, while your mother’s intentions were good, it’s best to avoid putting anything in the ear canal when we’re trying to determine the cause of a discharge. Now, I'm going to need to take a look inside your ear to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Please, look. I want to know what is happening. It is worrying me a little, this ear. I hope it is not something serious.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please, have a seat here, and I’ll take a look. I'll need you to lie on your side, facing away from me. Now, just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some cerumen – earwax – present, and some inflammation of the ear canal. There appears to be a small amount of discharge as well. I can’t get a clear view of the tympanic membrane – that’s the eardrum – because of the blockage. It’s difficult to assess properly at the moment. It could be a simple earwax impaction with a bit of outer ear infection, or otitis externa, but given the discharge and the blockage, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a culture of the discharge to identify any bacteria present.
PATIENT: A… culture? You mean, take some of the liquid and… test it? I do not understand. Is it a painful test, Doctor? And what does “otitis externa” mean? I am sorry to ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Mr. Radillo. It’s my job to explain things clearly. A culture simply means we’ll take a small sample of the discharge and send it to the laboratory to see if any bacteria are growing. It's not painful, I promise. We'll use a small swab, and it will only take a moment. As for otitis externa, that's an infection of the outer ear canal – sometimes called swimmer’s ear. It can cause pain, inflammation, and discharge. We're not definitively saying that's what you have, but it's something we need to consider. I’m also going to recommend a course of antibiotic ear drops, just to be on the safe side, while we wait for the culture results. I'll also need to ask about your medical history, any allergies you may have, and current medications you're taking. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… acceptable. Ear drops, and a test of the liquid. I will try to explain it to my son. I have no allergies, I think. And I do not take any medicines, regularly. Sometimes, for my back, but only when it is very bad. A small white pill… I do not remember the name. My wife used to get it for me. But she is… not here now. I do not take it often.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can document that you occasionally use a medication for back pain, but don’t currently take anything regularly. We’ll try to get more details later if needed. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had… a problem with my heart, many years ago. When I was living in Somalia, I had a fever, a very bad fever. I was very sick. The doctors… they said it affected my heart. I came to this country, and they treated me. I have been to the hospital a few times for check-ups. But it is… better now. I do not have problems with my heart anymore, I think. I have also had… problems with my sugar. The doctors said I have diabetes. But I try to eat carefully, and I take… pills, sometimes. But I do not take them every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of rheumatic fever affecting the heart, and a diagnosis of diabetes, managed with diet and occasional medication. Do you know what medication you were taking for your diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not remember the name. It was a small, yellow pill, I think. My wife, she always took care of my medicines. She knew everything. But… she passed away last year. I try to remember, but… it is difficult. I have not seen a doctor regularly since she died. I do not take it now, the pill. I try to eat healthy foods, and that is all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Radillo. It’s understandable that you’re having trouble remembering details under these circumstances. We’ll document that you have a history of diabetes, previously managed with medication, and that you currently manage it with diet. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your heart condition?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Only the hospital for my heart. And… once, when I was a young man, I broke my arm. Playing football. But that was a very long time ago. They put it in a cast. That is all. No other hospitals, no other surgeries. I have been very lucky, I think. Except for my heart, and… my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries aside from treatment for a broken arm in your youth. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My mother… she had problems with her sugar, like me. And my father, he had a weak heart. He died when he was still young, from his heart. I have two brothers, and one sister. My sister is still alive, but I do not see her often. She lives in… another country. My brothers… they have both passed away. One had a problem with his kidneys, and the other… he had an accident. Not a very good family history, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of diabetes and heart disease in your family. Now, before we move on, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. I never smoke. And I do not drink alcohol, not even beer or wine. I used to, a long time ago, when I was a young man, but I stopped many years ago. And I do not use any… other things. I am a religious man, Doctor. I follow the teachings of Islam. We do not do such things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Radillo. I appreciate your openness. Now, let’s get back to your ear. I'm going to order that culture, and I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops, as I mentioned earlier. I'll also have the nurse check your blood pressure and temperature before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. How long will it take for the test results to come back? And… are these ear drops, will they hurt? And… will I be able to hear better with them? I worry about my hearing, you see. It is important to me.
DOCTOR: The culture results typically take 2-3 business days to come back, Mr. Radillo. We will call you as soon as we have them. As for the ear drops, they shouldn’t hurt. You might feel a slight cooling sensation when you put them in, but nothing more. As for improving your hearing, the ear drops will help to address the infection, which should improve your hearing over time, but I can't promise a full recovery. It depends on the extent of the infection and whether there is any underlying damage. We'll reassess your hearing after the course of antibiotics to see how you're doing. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you for your help. You have been very patient with me, and I appreciate it. I will wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to check your vitals and give you the prescription.
