DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. Thanks for havin' me. Well, it's this mornin' sickness, really. Been feelin' quite queasy for a few weeks now, especially first thing. Now, I know it sounds daft for an old fella like meself, but it's been botherin' me. They told me it's somethin' to do with me heart, ye see. Heart failure, they said.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. Morning sickness… and you were told it could be related to heart failure?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. The nurse – lovely woman, name o' Moira – she said it can happen with the… well, with the heart not pumpin' as well as it should. Makes ye feel awful, it does. Like seasickness, but it's every mornin'. And it's not just the feelin' sick, it's… it's hard to explain. Like a wee bit o' pressure in me chest with it, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea primarily in the mornings, and you've noticed some chest pressure accompanying it at times. Can you describe this chest pressure for me?
PATIENT: Aye, I can try. It's not a sharp pain, mind ye. More like… a tightness, a heaviness. Like someone's sittin' on me chest, but a light one. It comes and goes, usually when the sickness is at its worst. Doesn't last long, thankfully. Maybe five minutes or so. It's just… worryin', ye ken? It's the heart, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Chest pressure always warrants investigation, especially given the history of potential heart failure. Now, to get a clearer picture, let's go through some other things. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, perhaps when you're walking or lying flat?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… I have been a wee bit puffier than usual. Not like I'm gaspin' for air, but I definitely feel it more when I'm climbin' the stairs at home. And lyin' flat… aye, I've been proppin' meself up with an extra pillow or two at night. It's not comfortable lyin' completely flat anymore. I just put it down to gettin' older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. Puffiness and needing extra pillows to sleep are both things we need to consider. Now, has this nausea or shortness of breath been getting worse over time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: It’s been a gradual thing, ye see. The sickness started off just a wee bit o' queasiness, once or twice a week. Now it's near every mornin', like clockwork. The shortness o’ breath… that’s been slowly gettin' worse too, I think. I used to walk the dog round the park every day, no problem. Now I have to stop and rest a couple o' times. It's not drastic, but I'm definitely not as sprightly as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual worsening of both symptoms. That's important. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Has a doctor ever diagnosed you with anything else besides the potential heart failure?
PATIENT: Aye, well, years ago, back when I was a younger man, I had a touch o' arthritis in me knees. Nothin' major, just a bit o' stiffness. And I had high blood pressure for a wee while, but they got it under control with tablets. Stopped takin’ them a few years back, doctor said I was fine. Apart from that… I've been fairly healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and previously controlled high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. I try to avoid tablets if I can, to be honest. I take a bit o’ cod liver oil now and then, for me joints, but that’s it. I like to keep things natural, if possible. And I don’t really believe in fillin’ meself with things I don’t need.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things, though I'm not overly fond o' mushrooms. But that's just a matter o' taste, not an allergy! I can walk through a field o' wildflowers with no bother at all.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, regarding your family history - has anyone in your family had heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Aye, me father, he had a weak heart, they said. He was a big man, always workin' hard on the farm. He had to slow down a lot in his later years, same as I'm feelin' now, actually. And me mother, she had high blood pressure. She was on tablets for it for years. My sister, she's got diabetes, type 2, I think. So, aye, there's a bit o' heart trouble and blood pressure in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A family history of heart trouble, hypertension, and diabetes. Now, just a couple more quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have, never will. I used to enjoy a wee dram now and then, but I gave that up a few years back. Doctor said it wasn't doin' me any favours, with the heart and all. I like a nice cup o' tea, though. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Thank you, Mr. Benic. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever ye need. I trust yer judgement, of course. Just let me know if it’s somethin’ uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. This might feel a little cold. Okay. Your heart sounds a little bit… muffled, and I do hear some slight crackles in the lower part of your lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. I didn't feel any pain in your abdomen, but it is a little bit full. It's nothing alarming, but it does give me some cause for concern, especially with what you've been telling me. I'm going to order a few tests, just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A wee bit worryin', mind ye, but sensible. Tests are a good idea. I’d rather know what’s what, to be honest. What sort o’ tests are we talkin’ about? Blood tests? X-rays?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests are definitely needed. We’ll check your kidney function, liver function, and look for something called BNP – that's a marker that can indicate heart failure. We’ll also do an EKG – that's a quick, painless test to look at your heart's electrical activity. And yes, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size. Depending on the results of those tests, we may need to consider an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of your heart, to get a more detailed look at how it’s functioning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough. A lot o' tests, but if it helps to get to the bottom o' things, then it's worth it. Blood tests, EKG, X-ray… and maybe that echo-thing if needed. Yes, that's fine. When can I get these done? And will I need to fast for any o' them?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, and they can do the blood tests and EKG right away. You do need to fast for the blood tests for at least 8 hours beforehand, so no breakfast or anything before you come in. We can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. As for the echocardiogram, we’ll hold off on that for now, and see what the other tests show. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds reasonable. No breakfast, I can manage that. Tomorrow mornin' for the X-ray… good. I'll hold off on that echo-thing, then. Just let me know when ye want me to come back for the results. I suppose it will be a few days?
DOCTOR: Yes, it will likely be a few days. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours, and the X-ray report will take a bit longer. Once I have everything, I'll give the office a call and we can schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand, Doctor. Worsenin’ shortness o’ breath, chest pain, or swollen ankles… go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. I’ll try to keep an eye on things, and I’ll be patient and wait for yer call. Thank ye for takin’ the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad you came in. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. Here’s a requisition form for the blood tests and EKG, and the appointment card for the chest X-ray tomorrow. If you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And again, if anything changes or worsens, please go to the emergency room. I think that’s everything for today. You take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye kindly, Doctor. I appreciate yer help. I will keep an eye on things, and I'll give the office a call if I have any questions. And I will remember to go to the emergency room if need be. Ye take care yerself too.
