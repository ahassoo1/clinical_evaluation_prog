DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin, mostly. It’s been getting darker, and I’ve just been so tired lately. It’s… a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue... that is something worth looking into. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When you say your skin is getting darker, can you tell me where specifically you've noticed the changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not all over. It's mostly on my face, and my hands, I think. And maybe a little bit on my neck. It’s hard to say for sure, but those are the places I've noticed it most. It's not like a sunburn or anything, it's just… deeper, you know? Like a tan that won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A persistent deepening of skin color, particularly on the face, hands, and neck. That's helpful. And how long would you say this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… that’s a good question. It feels like a few months now? Maybe three or four? It started slowly, and I just thought it was from being outside a little more. But it hasn’t gotten lighter, even with sunscreen. It’s definitely more noticeable now than it was then.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months of gradual darkening, not improving with sun protection. Has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, I don’t think. I mean, life is life, you know? Work is the same, same routine. I haven’t been traveling or anything. Oh! Wait… I did start taking a new vitamin, a few months ago. It’s… I can’t remember the name right offhand. My friend recommended it for energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new vitamin started around the same time… that’s good to know. Do you happen to remember anything about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, I’m terrible with names. It came in a big bottle… and it was orange? I think it had B vitamins in it… maybe? It was supposed to help with… well, just feeling less tired, I guess. I got it at the grocery store, not a pharmacy. It wasn't anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, an orange-colored vitamin supplement, containing B vitamins, purchased from a grocery store. We’ll definitely look into that. Now, you also mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It's just… I'm always tired, even after a full night’s sleep. I don’t have the energy to do much after work. I used to enjoy gardening, but now I just want to sit. It's not like I’m sick or anything, just… drained. And it's been getting worse slowly, like the skin thing. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Persistent fatigue alongside the skin changes... that's concerning enough that we need to investigate further. Before we move onto a physical exam, let's quickly go through some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is about the same, and my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in a while, but my clothes still fit okay. Nothing noticeable there, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no aches, no… oh! My stomach has been a little upset sometimes, but nothing major. Just some occasional indigestion. I thought it was just what I ate. I haven't been sick, though. Nothing like throwing up or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional indigestion, but no significant gastrointestinal issues. And no fever or aches. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. And I’ve only taken a few medications in my life, mostly just over-the-counter things for headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that cleared up with some physical therapy. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've managed to avoid all that, thankfully. My mom always said I was a tough kid!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh boy, family history… that's a bit complicated. My mom passed away a few years ago, and I didn't know my dad very well. She had some trouble with her blood sugar when she got older, but I'm not sure if that was diabetes or just… old age, you know? My brother is healthy as a horse, though. He’s always been strong. Nothing major on either side, I don’t think. I didn’t pay much attention to family medical stuff when I was younger. It’s not something we really talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of blood sugar issues on your mother’s side, but not a clear diagnosis. And your brother is healthy. Now, a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never tried a cigarette in my life. My mom didn't smoke, and I always stayed away from it. Bad habit, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, on a special occasion. Nothing regular, definitely not every day. I don't really have a sweet tooth for it, to be honest. Mostly, I drink water.
DOCTOR: Okay, very minimal alcohol consumption. Now, what is your occupation?
PATIENT: I'm a Chemical Plant and System Operator. So, I work at a chemical plant, mostly checking the systems and making sure everything is running smoothly. It's a pretty demanding job, but I've been doing it for a while now. It can be stressful, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a demanding job as a Chemical Plant and System Operator. And finally, let’s just confirm your height and weight. Is 159 cm and 60 kg accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. About 5 foot 2 inches and around 132 pounds, I think. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, but that's pretty close.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Paes, thank you for answering all those questions. It's very helpful. Based on what you've told me—the darkening skin, fatigue, the new vitamin supplement, and your occupation—I’d like to do a physical exam. It's just a basic check, looking at your skin, checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, so please do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. If you wouldn't mind, could you please roll up your sleeves and maybe lift your collar a bit?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. It's mostly on my face and hands, like I said, but you can check anywhere you need to. I'm a little worried it's getting darker even on my neck now. I hadn't really noticed until you asked about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some hyperpigmentation—that's just a medical term for increased skin darkening—on your face, hands, and neck. It’s more pronounced on the sun-exposed areas, as expected, but I’m also noting some discoloration in areas that wouldn’t normally get a lot of sun. The skin feels smooth, and I don’t see any lesions or rashes. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. And finally, I’ll just gently palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Overall, the physical exam is largely unremarkable, except for the hyperpigmentation. Now, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I am concerned about a few possibilities, including Addison's disease, iron deficiency anemia, or a reaction to the vitamin supplement you mentioned. To help narrow down the cause, I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, iron studies, and a cortisol level. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. Addison’s disease? That sounds… scary. But yes, I guess if you think blood work is needed, that’s fine. I just want to know what’s going on, so do whatever you think is best. Is that vitamin thing a likely cause, do you think? I stopped taking it a couple of days ago, just in case.
DOCTOR: It’s good you stopped taking the vitamin. While Addison’s disease is a serious condition, it's important to remember that we're not diagnosing anything yet—we’re just ruling things out. The vitamin could be a cause, yes, especially if it contains ingredients that interact with skin pigmentation. Some vitamins can cause photosensitivity, making your skin more vulnerable to darkening. However, the fatigue you’re experiencing makes me want to explore other possibilities, like iron deficiency or adrenal insufficiency . The blood work will give us a much clearer picture. Okay, I’m ordering a complete blood count, iron studies, cortisol level, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check your Vitamin B12 levels, just to be thorough. The lab should be able to draw the blood today. They’ll let you know when the results are available, usually within a few days. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense, Doctor. A few days sounds okay. So, I just go to the lab and they’ll draw my blood? Is there anything I need to do before I go, like fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, you just go to the lab. They should have all the information I'm sending over electronically. And yes, good question! For the cortisol level, it’s best to have the blood drawn in the morning, ideally between 8 and 9 AM, and you should fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. The other tests don't require fasting. They will ask you about medications you’re taking as well, so have that information ready. Here’s the lab requisition form. It has all the tests listed and the instructions. The lab is located at [Lab address]. Do you have any trouble getting there, or would you like me to write down some directions?
PATIENT: No, I know where that lab is. It's not too far. I think I’m okay with directions, thank you. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I was getting a little worried there. So, just go in the morning, don’t eat anything, and they’ll take my blood. And then wait for the results. Got it.
DOCTOR: Exactly. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, try not to stress too much, Ms. Paes. We’re taking the necessary steps to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any other concerns before you go, or shall we consider this consultation finished for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and for listening to me. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll go get the blood work done in the morning. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Paes. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and please call if anything changes. Have a good day. .
