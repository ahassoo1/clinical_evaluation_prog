DOCTOR: Right. Devin Reyno, 54. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. That’s me. I… I’ve been coughin’. A lot. And… there’s stuff in it. Red stuff. Not all the time, but… yeah. It worries me. I smoke, you know. Been smokin’ a long time. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly when I started, but a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. Coughing, with…hemoptysis, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Hemop… what now? Sorry, doc. I don’t… I don’t know fancy words. Just… blood. In the cough. Sometimes. Is that bad? I just want to get this over with, if I’m bein’ honest.
DOCTOR: Blood in the cough. Yes, that is concerning, Mr. Reyno. It always is. And frankly, given your smoking history, it’s… predictable. How much blood are we talking?
PATIENT: Predictable… yeah, I figured. Like I said, been smokin’ a long time. How much… hmm. Not a lot, not like… pourin’ out, you know? More like… streaks. Red streaks in the… the stuff I cough up. Sometimes just a little bit, sometimes a bit more. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t… hurt, really. Just… scary.
DOCTOR: Streaks, you say. And no pain associated with the cough itself?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. More like… a tickle, sometimes. A real deep tickle. Makes me cough harder, I guess. And… I get winded easy now. Used to be able to… well, I used to do a lot more. Before.
DOCTOR: Right. So, cough with hemoptysis, a “deep tickle,” and… shortness of breath. How long has this been going on, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. Time gets away from me, you know? I think… maybe a couple months? The blood, anyway. The cough has been around longer, probably closer to six months. It started kinda mild, just a little hackin’ now and then. Didn’t think much of it.
DOCTOR: Six months of cough, two months of hemoptysis. And you said it's progressively worsening?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. It’s… harder to breathe now, like I said. And the red stuff… it’s happenin’ more often. I used to go days without seein’ any. Now it feels like… every other time I cough, there’s somethin’. I don’t… I don’t want it to get worse, doc.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to get a chest X-ray, Mr. Reyno. And I'm going to want to listen to your lungs. Then, depending on what we find, we may need to consider a CT scan and a referral to a pulmonologist. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: X-ray… okay. Whatever you think is best. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but… that’s it. Medicare covers that, right? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover it, yes. We'll verify everything before proceeding. Let's get that X-ray done first. The technician is just down the hall. I'll need you to remove any metal jewelry you’re wearing. After the X-ray, come back and we'll discuss the results and formulate a plan.
PATIENT: Okay. Metal… right. I got a belt buckle, and… a watch. That’s about it. Down the hall… alright. I just want this over with, doc. I hope it’s nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: We'll know more after the X-ray, Mr. Reyno. Don’t jump to conclusions. Just go get that imaging done. I'll be here when you return.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks, doc.
DOCTOR: Another smoker. Honestly… .
