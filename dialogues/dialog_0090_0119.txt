DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. But… there’s been a… discharge. From my husband, that is. He couldn’t come with me today, but it’s him experiencing this… issue. It's quite unpleasant, really. I thought it best to get it checked, you understand. A man shouldn't just ignore these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is good you’re taking initiative. Though, frankly, I usually prefer to speak directly with the patient. But, alright. So, this discharge… can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… not clear, certainly. More… yellowish. And a bit thick, if I’m being honest. It’s certainly not something one would want to see. He noticed it a few days ago, after… well, after intimacy with a… friend. It’s probably nothing, but I insisted he get it looked at. One never knows, does one? It's just… unhygienic, frankly. He’s usually very particular about his… cleanliness.
DOCTOR: A yellowish discharge… and this occurred after intimacy with someone outside of your marriage, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that. He had a… brief encounter with a companion while on a business trip. He assured me it was a one-time thing, a moment of weakness, he called it. Though, I still find it rather… distasteful. But to answer your question, yes, that's when he noticed it. It’s just… worrying, isn’t it? I’ve always been very careful, and I expect the same from others. And frankly, I don’t understand why he felt the need.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. It sounds like your husband may have contracted a sexually transmitted infection. We need to get him in here for a proper examination and testing, of course. But before we do that, has he experienced any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I hadn't asked him that specifically! He’s not one to… complain, you see. Let me think… Now that you mention it, he did seem a little… uncomfortable yesterday. And he was rather quiet after… well, you know. No, he didn’t say anything about burning, but he did keep adjusting his… trousers, if you follow my meaning. He just said he felt a bit… sensitive. Honestly, men and their pride… it makes getting a straight answer nearly impossible. Do you think it’s serious, Doctor? I’ve always been very careful about these things.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity and discomfort… alright. It’s certainly concerning. It could be something relatively minor, but with a new partner involved, we have to rule out the more serious possibilities. We'll need to do a physical exam and some tests to determine the cause. Is your husband experiencing any fever, or pain in his lower abdomen?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’m aware of. He’s always been quite robust, that man. And no… I haven’t noticed any pain in his abdomen, no. He hasn’t mentioned it, at least. He's… not one to vocalize discomfort, you see. He tends to… suffer in silence. Honestly, I think he's embarrassed about the whole thing. It's just… a terrible situation, really. I've always stressed the importance of discretion, and this… this is hardly discreet. Do you think it’s something I should be worried about for myself, Doctor? I’ve always been very meticulous about… hygiene.
DOCTOR: It's good you are being cautious. Given the circumstances, it would be prudent for you to be tested as well, to rule out any potential transmission. We’ll schedule appointments for both of you. Now, has your husband had any previous sexually transmitted infections that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question, Doctor. He's not one to readily share… personal details, you understand. He did mention something, a long time ago, about a… youthful indiscretion. But he assured me it was treated, fully resolved. He was quite adamant about it. It was before he met me, of course. I certainly hope it wasn’t something serious. He always seemed… responsible, after that incident. Though, I suppose men can be… unreliable. It's just… unsettling to think about, isn't it? Do you think this new… encounter could have reawakened something?
DOCTOR: A previous infection and a new encounter... Alright. It's possible. Previous infections can sometimes reactivate. We need to run a full panel of tests to determine what's going on. I'm going to need to examine your husband, and I strongly recommend you get tested as well, just to be safe. We'll start with a urine sample from both of you, and then I'll need to perform a physical exam. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A full panel of tests, a physical exam… whatever you deem necessary. I just want to get this sorted out, discreetly, of course. He’s a respectable man, you understand. Though, frankly, I’m quite disappointed in his behavior. A urine sample… very well. And the physical exam… I suppose it’s necessary. But please, be as… efficient as possible. He wouldn't want to dwell on this any longer than he has to. And can you assure me everything will remain… confidential? This is a very delicate matter.
DOCTOR: Confidentiality is, of course, paramount. This clinic adheres to strict patient privacy guidelines. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. I'll have the nurse come in to collect the urine samples, and then we'll schedule appointments for both you and your husband for a full physical exam. I need to understand the full extent of this situation, and that requires a proper assessment. Now, are there any allergies I should be aware of for either of you?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of for either of us, thankfully. He's always been quite… sturdy, that man. Just a bit… foolish, at times. No, no allergies. Though, he does dislike the smell of lavender. A rather odd aversion, but it's true. But no medical allergies. And I, myself, have no allergies either. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. I just hope this can be resolved quickly and… quietly. It's quite embarrassing, you understand. A respectable man shouldn’t have to go through this.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll send the nurse in now to collect the urine samples. We’ll get the appointments scheduled as soon as possible. Please try to remain calm, and encourage your husband to do the same. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can determine the best course of action. Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
