DOCTOR: Hi Delano, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start us off, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Decosta, was it? Yes, well, it’s about my sight, naturally. It's... diminishing, shall we say. Not rapidly, thankfully, but noticeable enough to be a bother. I used to have such keen eyes, could spot a hawk circling a mile away. Now… not so much. It’s a bit concerning, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diminishing eyesight is definitely concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's helpful that you've noticed a change from your usual good vision. Let me just take a quick look at your record here… Alright, Delano, it says you're 52 years old. Have you had any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Recent changes… hmm. Well, the divorce was finalized about six months ago. A rather unpleasant affair, truthfully. Beyond that... no, not particularly. I maintain a fairly consistent routine, though I admit I haven't been as diligent with my… exercises as I once was. It’s difficult to motivate oneself, you understand. And I certainly haven’t been sleeping as well as I should. But those are… life changes, not medical ones, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: I understand. Those are significant life changes, and they can absolutely impact your health, even if they don’t feel directly medical. Stress and lack of sleep can affect many things. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the vision changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… no flashes of light, no floaters, no pain. Just… a general fuzziness, especially at a distance. And I find myself straining more to read, particularly smaller print. It’s not crippling, mind you. I can still see, it’s just… less clear. It’s rather inconvenient, honestly. I have quite a bit of reading I enjoy, historical texts mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no flashes, floaters, or pain – that’s good to know. Fuzziness at a distance and increased strain with reading… that gives us a little more to work with. Alright, Delano, I'd like to do a quick eye exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll check your visual acuity, your peripheral vision, and then take a look inside your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An ophthalmoscope, you say? Is that… painful? I’ve never had one of those before. I suppose I have little choice if it’s necessary. I do try to avoid unnecessary procedures, you understand. I’ve always had a rather… sensitive constitution. But proceed, if you deem it essential. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: It’s not painful at all, Delano, I promise. It just allows me to see the back of your eye, the retina, optic nerve – things we need to check. It involves shining a light into your eye, and you'll just need to look straight ahead. It's very quick. And I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your visual acuity. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Very well. A chart, you say? I suppose that’s straightforward enough. Though I must say, the lighting in here is rather harsh. Makes it difficult to focus. Let's see… E, F, P… is that a T? It’s rather… blurry, as expected. This is most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It does seem like your vision is reduced, as you've noticed. We'll get a clearer picture with the rest of the exam. Now, I’m going to have you look straight ahead at this point here. I'm going to hold up some fingers in your side vision, and I want you to tell me when you can see them. Just say “yes” when you see something. Don't blink, if you can help it. Ready?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Another test. Very well. I do hope this won't take too long. Yes… I see something… a flicker. Yes… there. Yes… now nothing. This is… tedious. Are we nearly finished with this part? My eyes are beginning to strain.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Delano, just a few more. It’s good you’re letting me know about the strain; we can take a break if needed. Alright, now I’m going to use this instrument to look inside your eyes. It won’t hurt, but I’ll be very close to your face. I’m just shining a light to get a good view of your retina. Look straight ahead, and try to relax. I’ll do one eye at a time. Okay, all done. Let me just take a moment to review everything…
PATIENT: Finally. A moment to rest my eyes. Do go ahead, Doctor. I trust you have reached some… conclusion. I have a rather busy afternoon, you understand. Historical texts do not read themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delano. So, the good news is I don't see any signs of anything urgent like a retinal detachment or glaucoma. However, I do see some mild drusen, which are small deposits under the retina. These are fairly common as we age, and in many cases, they don’t cause any problems. But they can be a sign of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. It seems like you're in the early stages, thankfully. Also, your visual acuity and peripheral vision are slightly reduced, which could be related to the AMD or simply age-related changes. To get a more definitive picture, I’d like to order a few tests: an Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT, scan to get a detailed cross-section of your retina, and a visual field test to map out your peripheral vision. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: OCT scan… visual field test… More tests. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather… burdensome. AMD, you say? Is that… serious? Will I go blind? I rely on my eyesight, you understand. Historical research requires keen vision. And what of the cost? I am, regrettably, without insurance at present. These tests… they won't be inexpensive, will they?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Delano. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried. AMD can be serious, but thankfully, we’ve caught it early. Many people with early AMD never experience significant vision loss, especially with monitoring and, if needed, treatment. The tests will help us determine the extent of the AMD and if treatment is necessary. The OCT scan is around $250, and the visual field test is about $100. I also want to be upfront about the possibility of future treatment, should it be needed. There are injections and other therapies, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Since you don’t have insurance, let’s see what we can do. I can have our billing department look into potential financial assistance programs or explore lower-cost options at local clinics. I’ll also write a detailed prescription for new glasses with a stronger magnification, which may help with your reading and overall vision in the meantime. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… a stronger magnification… Very well, Doctor. I suppose that is… acceptable. Glasses with a stronger magnification are certainly preferable to needles. Please do explore those assistance programs. And a detailed prescription, if you would. I require precise measurements, you understand. The devil is in the details, as they say. And perhaps… perhaps you could recommend a reputable optician? One who understands the importance of historical texts, ideally.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Delano. I’ll have the billing department contact you directly regarding the financial assistance options. And I’ll write a very detailed prescription, specifying your exact needs. I also have a list of reputable opticians in the area. I'll highlight a few that have received positive feedback, and I'll make a note to check if any specialize in vision correction for detailed work. I’ll have my assistant print those out for you before you leave. In the meantime, try to avoid straining your eyes as much as possible. And if you notice any sudden changes in your vision – flashes of light, floaters, or a curtain coming down over your vision – please come back immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything… for now. I appreciate your… thoroughness, and your willingness to explore those assistance programs. It is reassuring to know you are taking my concerns seriously. I shall await the contact from your billing department, and the list of opticians. Thank you, Doctor Decosta.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Delano. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad we were able to address your concerns. My assistant will get those materials to you before you leave. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if anything changes. Have a good afternoon, and I hope you get back to enjoying your historical texts soon.
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. And to you as well. Perhaps I shall see you again… under more favorable circumstances.
