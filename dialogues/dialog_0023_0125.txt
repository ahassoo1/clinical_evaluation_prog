DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, well, it’s about getting checked for… you know. HIV. I wanted to get it done. Just to be sure, really. My wife and I… we’re careful, but better safe than sorry, isn’t it? Though honestly, with all the… types of people out there, you can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: “Careful” is always a good approach, Mr. Belan. And yes, routine screening is certainly a reasonable consideration. To clarify, you’re requesting an HIV test as a general precaution, not because you’re experiencing any specific symptoms or had a recent exposure you’re concerned about?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Nothing like that. It’s just… peace of mind, really. And frankly, I like to know these things. Some people just… drift along, oblivious. I prefer to be informed, you understand? It's about taking responsibility, unlike some folks I've seen.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Belan, I understand the desire for information. And taking a proactive approach to your health is commendable. Before we proceed with the test, I need to gather a bit more information. Have you ever had an HIV test before?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I… think so? Possibly when I first came to this country, maybe? It was a while ago, and honestly, those things all blur together. Lots of forms, lots of waiting… I wouldn’t be surprised if I’d had one, but I can't say for certain. It wasn’t a priority then, if I'm being honest. Things are different now.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a potentially unknown prior testing history. We'll proceed as if this is your first test, just to be absolutely certain. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, even something minor like a cold or flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I’m generally very healthy. I eat well, I exercise, and I avoid… questionable establishments. My wife keeps me in line, you see. She’s very particular about hygiene. I had a little sniffle maybe a month ago, but that was it. It cleared up quickly. Unlike some people I know who drag everything out for weeks.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing special. My wife gets it from a health food store. She’s convinced it keeps me young. I don’t know if it works, but it can’t hurt, I suppose. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's about it. Rarely though. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. All those side effects, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. This information is confidential and important for assessing your risk. Have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Needles? Good heavens, no! Are you serious? I mean, really. I have never, ever done anything like that. That’s… frankly appalling. I wouldn’t even touch a used needle. Where would I even get one? Honestly, some of the questions you’re asking... it's a bit insulting, isn't it? I’m a respectable man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. I apologize if the questions are… direct. They are standard procedure for risk assessment, and I assure you, they are not meant to be insulting. I simply need to gather a complete medical history. Now, regarding sexual activity… have you ever had sexual contact with someone who has told you they have HIV, or with someone whose HIV status you were unsure of?
PATIENT: Look, I’ve been married for fifteen years. Fifteen years! And we’re… discreet. Very discreet. I don’t go around… socializing, if you catch my drift. And my wife is… a very devoted woman. I find your line of questioning rather… inappropriate. Frankly, it feels like you're implying something. I came here for a test, not an interrogation. Honestly. It's rather rude.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your discomfort. I assure you, I am not attempting to imply anything. However, as a physician, I must gather comprehensive information to ensure accurate risk assessment and appropriate care. It is my professional responsibility. Now, to proceed with the test, I will need to perform a brief physical examination. It’s standard procedure, just to rule out any other potential causes for concern. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And discreet. I have a very busy schedule, you know. And frankly, I don't appreciate being treated like… well, like that. Just get it over with. No need to poke and prod unnecessarily. A quick check will suffice. And I expect full confidentiality. Completely and utterly. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Belan. It will be quick and discreet. Now, if you'll please lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take your blood pressure. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Fine. But I'm not comfortable changing in here. Is there a private room? Really, the lack of consideration is astounding.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. There is a private room down the hall. I will meet you back here once you are finished. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please take your time.
PATIENT: Honestly. This is ridiculous.
