DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's lovely to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Chellsea. That sounds quite concerning. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: It was… a few weeks ago now. The other doctor, she said… well, she said I have cancer. She didn’t say much more than that, honestly. Just that I needed to see someone else, someone who… specializes. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. I don’t really know what kind, or… much of anything, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must have been quite a shock, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed when receiving news like that. It’s not uncommon for initial conversations to be brief, especially when further investigation is needed. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me the name of the doctor who initially informed you?
PATIENT: Um… Dr. Ellis. Yes, Dr. Ellis at the community hospital. She was… very busy, I think. It was a quick appointment. I don’t remember much else about what she said, just that I needed a specialist. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. It's not your responsibility to remember every detail, especially in a stressful situation. Knowing it was Dr. Ellis at the community hospital is helpful. Do you happen to have any records from that appointment – perhaps a summary report, or any test results she may have ordered?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Here. She gave me this. It's mostly just… dates and some words I don’t understand. And some pictures. I don’t know what any of it means.
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is very helpful. Let me take a moment to go through these reports. It looks like Dr. Ellis ordered some imaging scans – a CT scan and a biopsy. Ah, here we are. The biopsy report indicates the presence of… well, it's a bit complex, but it appears to be a type of adenocarcinoma. Do you mind if I explain what that means in simpler terms?
PATIENT: Please do, Doctor. I don’t understand any of those words. I just want to know… what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Of course. "Adenocarcinoma" simply means a cancer that starts in gland cells. These cells are found in many parts of the body, so it’s important to determine where this cancer originated. Based on these reports, it appears to be located in… the lung. Now, lung cancer can be quite serious, but it's also very treatable, especially when detected early. The staging – which tells us how far the cancer has spread – will be very important in determining the best course of action. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: The lung? I… I don't smoke. Never have. Is that… is that possible? And… what does “staging” mean? It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Chellsea, and it’s good you’re asking. You are absolutely right to be concerned. It is possible to develop lung cancer even if you’ve never smoked. While smoking is the leading cause, other factors can contribute, such as exposure to radon gas, air pollution, or a family history of lung cancer. Sometimes, the cause is simply unknown. Now, regarding staging… it’s a way of determining how much the cancer has grown and whether it has spread to other parts of your body. We use imaging scans – like CT scans, PET scans, and sometimes MRIs – to assess the size of the tumor and check for any signs of spread. The stages range from Stage 0 – meaning the cancer is very early and hasn’t spread – to Stage IV, meaning the cancer has spread to distant organs. Knowing the stage is crucial for determining the most effective treatment plan. We will need to do some additional testing to get a clearer picture of your situation. Would you be comfortable discussing some of those tests now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I… I want to know everything. What kind of tests? And… what happens if it’s… a bad stage?
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take things one step at a time. The next steps typically involve a PET scan, which is a more detailed imaging scan that can help us identify any areas where the cancer may have spread. We may also consider a bronchoscopy – a procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your airways to get a closer look at the tumor and take tissue samples. As for what happens if it’s a more advanced stage… the treatment options will depend on the specific type of lung cancer and its extent. These may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. We have a wonderful oncology team here, and they would work closely with you to develop a personalized treatment plan. We’ll discuss all the options in detail and answer any questions you may have. It’s important to remember that even in advanced stages, there are often treatments available to help manage the cancer and improve your quality of life. Before we schedule these tests, I want to review your medical history in more detail. Do you have any known allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. And… no medications. I’ve always been… healthy. Well, I was healthy. My husband… he was sick for a long time. That’s… that’s why I have Medicare. He needed a lot of care. I haven’t had to worry about doctors much until now. It's… it's strange to be the one needing care.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and a bit frightened when you’re suddenly the one needing medical attention, especially after spending so much time caring for your husband. It takes a lot of strength to transition from caregiver to patient. We’ll take excellent care of you, Chellsea. You're not alone in this, and we’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Now, to get things started, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. I'm just going to listen to your breathing, both front and back. Please take slow, deep breaths for me. I'm also going to check your lymph nodes in your neck and collarbone area. These are just routine checks, but it helps us get a better understanding of your overall condition. They feel… slightly enlarged. It's not necessarily a cause for alarm, as inflammation can cause this, but we'll keep it in mind. Your heart sounds regular, and your blood pressure is normal. Overall, your physical exam is stable. However, the slightly enlarged lymph nodes, combined with the imaging results, suggest that we should proceed with the additional testing – the PET scan and the bronchoscopy – to get a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. If that’s what you think is best. I just… I want to know what’s happening. I need to know. When can we do these tests?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Knowing is important, and we’ll move as quickly as we can. Let me check the scheduling availability. Okay, it looks like we can schedule the PET scan for next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. The bronchoscopy can be scheduled for the following Thursday at 10:30 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday and Thursday… Yes, that should be fine. I’ll have to arrange someone to… to drive me. But yes, that works. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve scheduled you for both appointments. You'll receive a call from the radiology department to confirm the details of the PET scan, and a nurse will contact you with instructions on how to prepare for the bronchoscopy. It’s important to fast for at least six hours before both procedures. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. I’m also going to provide you with some information on lung cancer resources, just in case you want to learn more. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. For everything. I suppose… I’ll see you next Tuesday?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Yes, I’ll see you next Tuesday. And remember, please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Take care, and try not to worry too much. We'll get through this together. .
