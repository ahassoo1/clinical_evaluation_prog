DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s been quite insistent, actually. It’s about… planning for the future, I suppose. He says we need to get one of those forms… an Advance Directive, or a POLST, was it? Honestly, I don't fully understand what either of those are, but he says it's important to have something in place, just in case.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, husbands often have a… proactive streak. It is sensible to consider these things. An Advance Directive and a POLST form… they’re both about outlining your wishes for medical care if you become unable to speak for yourself. An Advance Directive is more broad, covering a wider range of scenarios. A POLST is more specific, for people with serious illnesses, detailing what treatment you want now. Do you have any particular concerns that prompted your husband's insistence?
PATIENT: Concerns? No, not specifically. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I eat well, I exercise, I don’t smoke… it's just… a bit unsettling to think about, really. All this talk of what if. It feels rather morbid, if I'm being honest. I suppose he’s worried about… well, he says my mother wasn’t prepared. A rather messy situation, truthfully. But I assure you, I am not my mother. And I certainly don’t want to dwell on unpleasant possibilities.
DOCTOR: Understandable. It is difficult to contemplate these things when one is in good health. And it sounds as though your husband’s concerns stem from a difficult experience with his mother. Before we delve into the specifics of these forms, perhaps we should review your general medical history, just to have a baseline. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well… not as regularly as perhaps one should. I've always been rather… self-sufficient when it comes to my health. A bit of a cold here and there, the usual aches and pains, but nothing serious enough to warrant constant visits to the doctor. My husband, of course, thinks I should be checked head to toe annually, but honestly, I find it a bit of a waste of time and money. I used to see Dr. Abernathy, but he retired a few years ago. I haven’t really replaced him, no. I manage.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. I had my tonsils removed as a child – a very long time ago, of course – but that was it. Honestly, I've been quite fortunate in my health. I pride myself on being… resilient. It’s rather frustrating that my husband seems to think I'm on the verge of collapse at any moment. He worries far too much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Well, resilience is certainly a positive attribute. It's good to hear you’ve had no major medical issues. And it sounds like your husband simply cares deeply for you. Just to be thorough, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a rather extensive topic. My mother’s side… there was some heart trouble, I believe. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had… diabetes, I think? It was never really discussed openly, truthfully. My father wasn’t one for sharing such… vulnerabilities. And my husband’s family… they’re all remarkably healthy, thankfully. A rather sturdy bunch, all of them. Honestly, I can’t recall any particularly concerning illnesses on either side. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Vague is perfectly acceptable, given the circumstances. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I believe in a natural approach to health. A good diet, plenty of exercise, and a positive outlook. That's my regimen. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that's the extent of it. Really. I'm quite particular about what I put into my body. I don’t believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Very good. Alright, Ms. Chilla, it sounds as though you’re in relatively good health, as your husband suspected. Given your lack of medical history, and your preference for a natural approach, we can proceed with a brief physical examination just to establish a baseline. It won't be extensive, just a basic check of your vitals, lungs, and heart. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? I… I hadn't anticipated that. I came here to discuss these forms, not to be poked and prodded. Honestly, I thought this would be a simple matter of paperwork. Is it absolutely necessary? I assure you, I feel perfectly fine. I'm quite capable of assessing my own health. Perhaps we could simply skip the examination and discuss the Advance Directive? It seems rather… unnecessary to subject myself to that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, while I respect your views, a basic physical examination is standard practice when establishing care with a new patient, even one presenting for advance care planning. It allows me to understand your current health status, which informs my recommendations. I assure you, it’s a brief and non-invasive procedure. Moreover, to properly advise you on these forms, I need to have a clear understanding of your health. It would be irresponsible of me to proceed without it. If you are unwilling to allow a basic examination, I am afraid I cannot assist you with your request. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but please understand the limitations of proceeding without it.
PATIENT: Honestly, it's just… humiliating, isn't it? Being treated like a child. I came here willingly, seeking information, and now I'm being subjected to this… interrogation. My husband will be delighted. He’s always thought I should be under a doctor’s constant surveillance. Very well. If it's absolutely necessary, I suppose I can endure a brief examination. But I must insist it be kept to a minimum. And I expect a full explanation of every step. I do not appreciate surprises. And I certainly don't appreciate being made to feel as though I'm… deficient. Now, let’s get this over with. But make it quick. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will begin by checking your blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Afterwards, I'll briefly examine your throat and ears. It should take no more than ten minutes. Please remove your shoes and socks. And if you could loosen your clothing slightly, that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. I haven't sat on one of these tables since… well, since childhood, I imagine. I trust you’ll be as swift as you promised. My luncheon is with… important people. And I certainly don't wish to be late. Now, get on with it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat appears clear, no signs of infection. Ears are clear as well. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. As I suspected, you appear to be in good health. Now, let’s discuss these Advance Directives…
PATIENT: Unremarkable. I should hope so. Honestly, I told you I was perfectly fine. Now, about these forms… my husband was quite insistent on having a POLST form, I believe it was called? Something about specific instructions for medical personnel? It all sounds rather… morbid, doesn’t it? And I must say, I find it rather unsettling to contemplate such… unpleasant possibilities. Perhaps we could start with the less… dramatic option? The Advance Directive, perhaps? Explain it to me in simple terms, please. I do not appreciate medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with the Advance Directive. Think of it as a set of instructions outlining your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It covers a broad range of scenarios – anything from end-of-life care to specific treatments you may or may not want. For example, it allows you to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are incapacitated. It also allows you to express your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments – things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and resuscitation. It's essentially a legal document, ensuring your wishes are respected, even when you are unable to speak for yourself. It’s less about specific instructions, and more about broader values and preferences. Do you understand so far?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… that would be my husband, I presume? He’s rather… assertive, and certainly has strong opinions on everything. Although, I’m not entirely certain I want him making decisions about my life... He tends to be rather… pragmatic. Values and preferences… it all sounds rather… abstract. And quite depressing, frankly. What if I simply don’t want life-sustaining treatments? Is that even an option? It seems rather… defeatist. And what about resuscitation? I certainly don’t want to be… shocked back to life if it's… pointless. But how does one articulate such… nuanced feelings? It's rather overwhelming, isn’t it? Perhaps I should simply decline the entire endeavor. It all seems far too complicated.
DOCTOR: Those are all valid concerns, Ms. Chilla. It’s perfectly acceptable to feel overwhelmed. And yes, you absolutely have the right to refuse any treatment, including life-sustaining measures. The Advance Directive is simply a tool to ensure your wishes are known and respected. The form allows you to specify exactly which treatments you want or do not want. You can also indicate your preferences regarding pain management and end-of-life care. And yes, you can certainly refuse resuscitation – that’s known as a Do Not Resuscitate order, or DNR. It’s not about defeatism, Ms. Chilla. It’s about control. It’s about ensuring your final wishes are honored, even when you are unable to advocate for yourself. Now, regarding your husband… you are not obligated to designate him as your healthcare proxy. You can choose anyone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, regardless of their relationship to you. It’s a personal choice, and you should choose someone who will respect your values and preferences, even if they differ from their own. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Control… yes, I suppose that’s what my husband keeps harping on about. But honestly, the thought of filling out such a document… it feels rather morbid, doesn’t it? A pre-written obituary, practically. And the thought of discussing such… unpleasant details with anyone, let alone my husband, is rather… distressing. Perhaps… perhaps I could simply state my wishes verbally? A recorded statement, perhaps? Would that be acceptable? I’m not comfortable putting everything in writing. It feels… final. And I certainly don’t want to be pressured into making decisions I’m not entirely comfortable with. My husband tends to be… persuasive. And as for designating him as my healthcare proxy… I suppose I could consider it. But I want to retain the right to change my mind at any moment. And I want to be absolutely certain he will respect my wishes, even if they differ from his own. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: A verbal statement can be considered, Ms. Chilla, but it’s generally not as legally binding as a written Advance Directive. It can be helpful, but it may not be sufficient in all situations. And yes, you absolutely have the right to change your mind at any moment. An Advance Directive is not a permanent contract. You can modify or revoke it at any time, as long as you are of sound mind. And regarding your husband, it’s important to have an open and honest conversation with him about your wishes. He should understand that his role is to advocate for your preferences, even if they differ from his own. Perhaps we could start by discussing your general values and beliefs regarding end-of-life care. What’s most important to you?
PATIENT: My values… well, that’s a rather… philosophical question, isn’t it? I suppose I value dignity, above all else. I don’t want to be… a burden. And I certainly don’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no hope of recovery. I’ve seen… things. Awful things. I don’t want to end up like that. And I certainly don’t want a lot of… fuss. No elaborate ceremonies, no prolonged goodbyes. Just… peace and quiet. And I want to be comfortable. That’s all. Is that too much to ask? And I want to be certain my husband understands that. He tends to be rather… sentimental. He means well, but he can be… overwhelming. He needs to understand that I want things to be simple. And dignified.
DOCTOR: Dignity, simplicity, and comfort. Those are perfectly reasonable wishes, Ms. Chilla. And yes, it's important that your husband understands your preferences. Let’s focus on the Advance Directive for now. We can address the POLST form later, if you’re comfortable. It’s a more specific document, outlining treatment preferences for serious illnesses. This form has several sections. One section allows you to designate your healthcare proxy. Another section allows you to express your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments. And a final section allows you to specify your preferences regarding pain management and end-of-life care. We can go through each section together, and I can help you articulate your wishes. We don't have to fill out everything at once. We can take our time and make sure you're comfortable with everything. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Very well. If you insist. But I must warn you, I’m not particularly fond of paperwork. And I tend to get… flustered easily. Healthcare proxy first, I suppose. That would be my husband, as much as I dislike the prospect. But I want to be absolutely certain I can change my mind later. And I want to specify what powers he doesn’t have. He tends to be… overbearing. Can I limit his authority in any way? Perhaps restrict him from making decisions about… experimental treatments? Or prolonging life artificially? I don’t want him… interfering with my final wishes. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You have the right to specify the scope of your healthcare proxy’s authority. You can limit his powers in any way you choose. This section allows you to specify which decisions your proxy can make, and which decisions require additional consultation. You can also specify any specific instructions or preferences. For example, you can specify that he cannot authorize experimental treatments without consulting with another physician. You can also specify that he cannot prolong life artificially if you have a Do Not Resuscitate order. Here, you can add any specific instructions or preferences you have regarding your end-of-life care. We can also add a clause specifying that he must respect your previously expressed wishes, even if they differ from his own. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds reassuring. Yes, a clause specifying that he must respect my previously expressed wishes is essential. He tends to… reinterpret things to suit his own agenda. And can I specify who else he must consult with? Perhaps a friend? Or another physician? Someone who knows my wishes? He tends to… surround himself with people who agree with him. And what about a Do Not Resuscitate order? Is that something we can address now? I certainly don’t want to be… shocked back to life if there’s no hope. It seems rather… barbaric. This is all rather… overwhelming, isn’t it? I wish I hadn’t agreed to this.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can absolutely specify who your healthcare proxy must consult with. You can list specific individuals, or you can specify a general requirement for consultation with another physician or friend. Here, you can add the names and contact information of anyone you want your proxy to consult with. And yes, we can address the Do Not Resuscitate order now. It’s a legal document outlining your wishes regarding resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. This form requires a physician’s signature, and it must be kept in a readily accessible location. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Chilla. This is a lot to process. We can take our time, and we can go through everything step-by-step. We don’t have to fill out everything at once. How about we focus on designating your healthcare proxy for now?
PATIENT: Very well. Let's get this over with. Healthcare proxy… that would be my husband, Ahmed. His contact information is… ...his phone number is 555-123-4567… his address is… 123 Main Street, Anytown… I suppose that’s all he needs? He tends to be rather… verbose, so I doubt he needs any additional information. And is that it? Do I need to sign anything? I’m not particularly fond of signing legal documents. It feels… final. I wish I hadn't started this whole endeavor. Perhaps I should just… leave it blank.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Ahmed's information is now recorded. And yes, you will need to sign the form to make it legally binding. Here, you will need to sign your name and date the form. It’s a simple signature, just confirming that you have designated Ahmed as your healthcare proxy. I understand your hesitation, Ms. Chilla. Signing a legal document can feel final. But it’s also empowering. It’s a way of ensuring your wishes are respected, even when you are unable to speak for yourself. And you are not obligated to fill out the entire form at once. We can start with designating your healthcare proxy, and we can address the other sections later, if you’re comfortable. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s get it over with. There. Is that sufficient? I must say, I’m rather uncomfortable with all this legal jargon. It feels… ominous. Now what? Do I need to memorize something? Or recite an oath? I wish I hadn’t agreed to this whole endeavor. It’s all rather… unsettling. Perhaps I should just… leave.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your signature is now on the form, and it's legally binding. You do not need to memorize anything or recite an oath. We can stop here for today, Ms. Chilla. You have successfully designated Ahmed as your healthcare proxy, and that's a significant step. We can address the other sections of the Advance Directive at a later date, if you're comfortable. I understand that this process can be unsettling. It's not easy to contemplate difficult decisions about your future. But you've done a good job today, and you should be proud of yourself. Would you like me to make a copy of the form for your records?
PATIENT: A copy… yes, that would be… helpful. I suppose I should have something for my records. And is that all? Can I finally leave now? I have a luncheon appointment, you know. I wouldn't want to be late. And thank you… I suppose. For your… assistance. Although, I must say, I wish I hadn’t started this whole endeavor. It’s all rather… stressful.
DOCTOR: Here's a copy for your records, Ms. Chilla. And yes, you are free to leave now. Thank you for your time today. And if you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your luncheon.
