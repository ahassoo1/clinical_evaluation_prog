DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Mirriam. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, feels like a week now. Not constantly, mind you, but they just keep coming back. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: A week of hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week. Maybe a little longer? Time does funny things these days, doesn't it? They don't come after every meal, or anything like that. Just…pop up when I least expect them. It’s not painful, just… startling. And a bit embarrassing when I’m out and about.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything specific seemed to trigger these bouts of hiccups, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Now let me think… Not that I can recall, honestly. I haven't been doing anything different. I’ve been eating my usual foods, drinking my tea… maybe a little more excited than usual lately, visiting with my grandchildren, but that's a good kind of excited! I haven't tried anything to make them stop, either. Never really had hiccups last this long before.
DOCTOR: Visiting with grandchildren is certainly not a trigger I typically inquire about. Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing else at all. Just the hiccups. No pain, no trouble breathing, no feeling sick to my stomach… everything else is perfectly normal. I've been sleeping alright, eating alright… like I said, just these pesky hiccups. It’s a bit of a mystery, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, let’s review a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got that sorted with some pills. I haven’t taken those in ages though, it's been perfectly fine since. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with being an old girl, you know? I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: And were you prescribed any medications for that blood pressure, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I was. Let me think… it was Lisinopril, I believe. A little white pill. I took it for…oh, goodness, maybe five years? Then the doctor said my blood pressure was good enough to stop taking it. And I haven't been back to see anyone for it since. Is that important, Doctor? I mean, is that what's causing the hiccups?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Sucich. Some medications can have… lingering effects, or interact with other factors. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A long time ago, I had my appendix out when I was just a girl. And… let me see… when I broke my wrist a few years back, I had a little operation to fix it. That was… oh, maybe fifteen years ago? Nothing major, though. Just a little bit of fixing. Are all these old things important, Doctor? I feel like I’m giving you a whole history book here!
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a complete picture, Ms. Sucich. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That's a hard one. My mother lived to be a very old woman, very healthy, mostly. She had a bit of trouble with her arthritis when she got older, and my father… he had diabetes, I think. And his brother, he had heart trouble. It’s been so long, Doctor. I’m trying my best to remember. We didn’t really talk about those things much when I was growing up. It wasn’t the done thing.
DOCTOR: I see. And finally, Ms. Sucich, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I can eat anything, take anything… well, except maybe that time I tried a really spicy curry, but that was my own fault! I’m a pretty sturdy old girl, really. I think I’ve built up an immunity to most things. But honestly, Doctor, all this talk of old things and medicines… it’s a bit worrying, isn’t it? Are you thinking it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sucich, it is unlikely to be serious. However, persistent hiccups can indicate an underlying issue, and it is my duty to rule out any potential causes. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a quick look at your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. It’s just… I haven't been feeling unwell at all, you see? But I trust your judgement. Go ahead, then. Let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm a bit creaky, you know, so be gentle!
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please. And another one… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Everything appears normal, Ms. Sucich.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s good to hear, isn’t it? So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it just… one of those things? Something that will go away on its own? I really don’t want to have to keep coming back for tests and things, you see. I'm a bit of a homebody, and all these doctor visits are rather tiring.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sucich, in cases like yours, where the physical exam is unremarkable and there are no concerning symptoms, hiccups are often idiopathic – meaning they have no identifiable cause. It's likely a benign nerve irritation. However, to rule out some less common possibilities, I would like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Just to be thorough. It’s a simple blood draw. Can be done here at the clinic.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood draw, you say? Well, I do dislike needles, Doctor. But if you think it’s important… alright. Yes, I suppose I can manage a blood draw. Will it take long? And will it hurt much? I always get a bit faint with needles, you see. It's silly, I know, but… well, I’m an old girl, and things aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Sucich. It will take only a few minutes, and the discomfort is minimal. A small pinch, that’s all. The phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, try drinking a glass of water slowly. Sometimes that can help settle the diaphragm. I’ll write the order for the blood work, and you can head over to the lab now. They’re just down the hall.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. A small pinch, you say? Well, I suppose I can handle a small pinch. Down the hall, you say? Is it far? I don’t walk very quickly, you see. And I tend to get a bit… lost, sometimes. Is there someone who can show me the way? I do apologize for being such a bother, Doctor. I just don’t get out much anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sucich, I’ll have the nurse escort you to the lab. It’s just around the corner. Don’t worry, it’s not far at all. Just try to relax. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss the next steps, if any. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me, and for your patience. And thank you for the nurse, too. I do appreciate it. You don’t think it’s anything serious, do you? Just… a bit of a nuisance, hopefully? I do have a lovely tea waiting for me at home, you see, and I’d really like to get back to it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sucich, based on the examination, it is highly unlikely to be anything serious. It's likely a temporary irritation. I’m sure you’ll be enjoying your tea soon enough. The nurse will be with you shortly to take you to the lab. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s a relief to hear. Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. .
