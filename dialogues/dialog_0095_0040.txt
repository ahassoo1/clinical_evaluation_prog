DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. It keeps coming back. And with that, I seem to get infections… down there. It’s been happening for a while now, and it’s getting a bit tiring, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Pain in your side and recurrent infections… “down there,” as you say. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When did this side pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, not that I recall. I suppose it started… maybe a year ago? It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, other times it’s quite sharp. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it began. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. So, about a year ago, intermittent pain in your side – sometimes dull, sometimes sharp. And you mentioned infections at the same time?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Usually when the pain gets bad, I end up with an infection. I’ve been to the doctor a couple of times for them, had some medicine… antibiotics, I think they were. It helps for a bit, but then it comes back. It’s a bit of a cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cycle of pain followed by infection, treated with antibiotics that provide temporary relief. Can you tell me a little more about these infections?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… uncomfortable. I have to go to the bathroom very often, and it burns when I go. I also feel quite weak when it’s bad. The doctor did some tests, you know, with my… water. Said it was an infection. Nothing more specific than that, if I recall. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright, frequent urination, burning sensation during urination, and weakness accompanying the infections. It sounds like you’ve had urinary tract infections, or UTIs. To get a better understanding, could you describe where exactly you’re feeling the side pain?
PATIENT: That's what the doctor said, yes, a UTI. The pain… it’s on my side, a bit below my ribs, kind of in my back too. It's hard to say exactly where… it sort of radiates around, you see? It's not just one spot. More on the left side, I think, but sometimes it feels both sides. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, pain below the ribs, radiating to your back, more prominent on the left side, but sometimes both sides. I want to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. The doctor told me a while back I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. He said I have little sacs on them. It wasn’t anything they could really fix, he said. Just monitor it. I forget most of the details, to be honest. It was quite a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, polycystic kidney disease. That’s important information. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. I’ve been quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. Aside from this kidney business, I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother had some trouble with his heart, years ago. But beyond that, I don’t really know. We weren’t a family that talked much about health, you see. It wasn’t really encouraged.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your brother. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I’m retired now, so I don’t do much strenuous work. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice. I live alone, so I mostly keep to myself. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too exciting, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoy gardening, eat a relatively healthy diet, no smoking, and occasional wine. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've taken quite a few different medicines over the years, and never had a reaction. The doctor has given me various things for the infections, and for my blood pressure, and I've always been alright. I’m fairly sure I don't have any allergies, but I haven’t kept a list or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And can you tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. I think it's called… amlodipine? And I take something for my water, when I have an infection, but that’s different each time. The doctor prescribes it when I see him. I don't take anything else regularly, just those two when needed. I have the pills at home if you need the names written down.
DOCTOR: Alright, amlodipine for blood pressure and antibiotics as needed for UTIs. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure again. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. This may be slightly uncomfortable, please let me know if you feel any significant pain. … There’s tenderness in your left flank. And a slight fullness. Do you feel pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s where it hurts. It’s not sharp, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. A bit of a dull ache, really. And yes, I feel it radiating around a bit, like I said. It's worse when you press directly on it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, that tenderness is consistent with a kidney issue. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease, recurrent UTIs, and flank pain, I suspect you may have a kidney infection, or pyelonephritis. However, we need to confirm this with some tests. I'm going to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and look for signs of infection. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me now?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary.
DOCTOR: Great. The restroom is just down the hall to the left. There’s a collection cup and instructions inside. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream. Once you’ve collected the sample, bring it back to me, and we’ll get it sent to the lab. While we’re waiting for the results, I also want to discuss some potential treatment options, depending on what the tests show. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I'll go and get the sample now. A mid-stream sample, you said? I’ll do my best. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time. I’ll be here when you return.
