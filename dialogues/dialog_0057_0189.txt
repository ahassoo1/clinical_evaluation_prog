DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. Nice to meet you. As if meeting a doctor is something to celebrate. Well, it’s this…business. Been happening for a couple days now. Not pleasant, I’ll tell you that. Blood in my stool. Plain and simple. Don't see why I need to explain it all in detail, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s certainly concerning to see blood in your stool, and you’re right, you don’t need to go into unnecessary detail. A couple of days now… okay. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good Lord. It’s…red. What do you want me to do, get out a paint chart? It’s not bright red, if that’s what you’re getting at. More…darkish. Like old pennies, maybe. And it's not every time, you understand. Just…sometimes. And it's not gushing, if that's what you're thinking. Just…streaks. Honestly, I've seen better colours in my time, flying over the Pacific.
DOCTOR: Okay, darkish, like old pennies, and streaks, not a large amount. That’s helpful, thank you. And it’s not with every bowel movement. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits along with this?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Honestly, doctor, at my age, going at all is a victory. But…well, now that you mention it, it's been a bit… looser than usual. Not full-blown diarrhea, mind you, but not… solid. More like… porridge, I suppose. And I've had a bit of cramping, down low. Though that could just be my old bones complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools along with the cramping. And you said cramping is “down low”?
PATIENT: Down low. Where else would it be? Honestly. It's in my abdomen, lower part. Like… right here. It’s not agonizing pain, mind you. Just…uncomfortable. A dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes. Probably just something I ate. Though I can't recall anything that bad, come to think of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower abdomen cramping, dull ache, comes and goes. I understand. Now, have you experienced any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't been burning up, if that's what you mean. Nausea… a bit, maybe? Just a little queasy sometimes, but I wouldn't call it proper vomiting. Not like when I was a young pilot and got airsick over the Rockies. That was vomiting. This is just…a general feeling of being off. Nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, just a little queasiness. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Oh, goodness. At my age, everything's changing. But… I suppose I've lost a bit. Not intentionally, mind you. The wife… well, my ex-wife used to fuss about me losing weight. Said I needed to keep it on. But she’s gone now, so… Probably a few pounds, I’d guess. Nothing major. Just…not as robust as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds lost unintentionally. And have you had any previous medical problems, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmph. Once, when I was a boy, had a nasty bout of pneumonia. And… well, a broken arm when I was learning to fly. Landed a bit rough, you see. Other than that, I've been remarkably healthy, thank you very much. Always been a strong constitution. Didn't spend much time coddling in bed, unlike some folks.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia as a child and a broken arm. And you said you’ve been generally healthy. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? You think I want to be pumped full of chemicals at my age? No. I don't take a thing. Never have, really. A bit of liniment for my aching joints now and then, but that’s it. I believe in letting nature take its course. All these pills and potions…just a waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… oh, yes. Appendicitis when I was in my early twenties. Back in '62, it was. They took the appendix out, naturally. Other than that, nothing. Simple operation. I was back on my feet in a few days. Didn’t keep me from flying, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in 1962. And finally, is there any history of colon cancer or other digestive problems in your family?
PATIENT: Digestive problems, eh? Well, my mother… she had some trouble with her stomach, always complaining of indigestion. And my uncle, on my father’s side… I seem to recall something about him having a blockage. Needed an operation, I think. But… that was a long time ago. And it wasn't cancer, as far as I know. Just…a troublesome stomach. It wasn’t something we talked about much. Family doesn't dwell on unpleasantness, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and do a rectal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on.
PATIENT: Rectal exam?! Good heavens, doctor. Is that really necessary? I mean, I've told you everything. Blood in the stool, loose bowels, a bit of cramping… what more do you need to poke around for? I've lived a long life, seen a lot of things, but… that's taking it a bit far, don't you think?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s not the most comfortable exam, I agree. However, a rectal exam is a very important part of evaluating blood in the stool, especially given your age. It allows me to check for any masses, tenderness, or other abnormalities that could be causing the bleeding. It’s the best way to get a direct assessment of the lower part of your colon and rectum. I want to be thorough and rule out anything serious. We can discuss the findings and next steps afterwards. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can certainly explore other options, but I strongly recommend it.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I'm warning you, doctor, if you find anything unpleasant, I don't want to hear about it. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And try to be gentle. At my age, everything's a bit… fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Just relax, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, I've completed the exam. I did detect some tenderness on the left side, and I felt a small…mass. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but it's something we need to look into. I also noted a small amount of dark, dried blood on the glove.
