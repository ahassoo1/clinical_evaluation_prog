DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been noticing weakness in my muscles, and my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s getting progressively worse, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness and drooping eyelids, progressively worsening… That is something we should investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, with my arms. Just feeling a bit tired after… normal activities, you know? Like carrying groceries or working around the house. Now it’s… well, it’s spreading. My legs feel it too, especially after standing for a while. It’s not painful, exactly, just… difficult. And it is getting worse each week, I’d say. It makes me a bit unsteady on my feet, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began in your arms, then spread to your legs, and it's been worsening weekly, causing difficulty and unsteadiness. Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s… not constant, no. It’s worse at the end of the day, definitely. In the mornings, I feel… relatively normal. But as the day goes on, and I use my muscles more, it gets steadily worse. It’s like they just… give out. It's hard to explain. It’s not sudden, just… a gradual fading of strength. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Worsening throughout the day and improving with rest is helpful information. And you mentioned drooping eyelids. Is that present in one eye, or both?
PATIENT: Both, actually. It started subtly, I barely noticed it. Now… well, people have started asking if I’m tired. It’s most noticeable in the evenings, naturally, when the weakness is at its worst. It’s… a little embarrassing, to be frank. It makes me look… unwell, I suppose. I haven’t been getting much sleep worrying about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. It's definitely worth investigating, and it's good you came in. Now, let's move on to some other questions to get a better overall picture. Do you have any difficulty with your vision – double vision, blurred vision, or any changes in your ability to see?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision seems… fine, as far as I can tell. I wear glasses, as you can see, for nearsightedness, but that hasn’t changed. Everything’s still clear, just… blurry if I don't have them on. I haven’t noticed any double vision or anything like that. I did have a bit of trouble focusing when I was very tired last week, but I put that down to lack of sleep, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in vision besides your usual nearsightedness. Have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Swallowing is… normal, I suppose. And my speech hasn’t been affected, as far as I know. No one has mentioned anything, and I don’t feel like it’s harder to speak. That’s good, isn't it? I’ve been a bit anxious about… everything, so I’ve been paying close attention to those things. I haven’t noticed any slurring or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, not that I recall. I had… chickenpox as a child, of course. And I broke my arm when I was younger, but that healed properly. No chronic illnesses, no… autoimmune diseases, nothing like that. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything serious. My divorce was… stressful, but not a medical condition, I suppose. Is that the sort of thing you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Schaust. No, I was more concerned with any diagnosed medical conditions. So, no known chronic illnesses. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the usual childhood vaccinations, I suppose. I… I’m not particularly fond of hospitals, so I’ve avoided them when possible. And nothing has ever been required, so… no. No surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any neurological conditions – things like muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, or multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: That’s a… good question. My mother… she had something with her nerves, I think. She was always tired, and had some trouble walking in her later years. The doctors never quite figured it out. It wasn't muscular dystrophy, I don’t think. She passed away a few years ago. My father… he was healthy as a horse, always active. I don’t recall anyone else having anything like that, but… my family isn't very close, so I don’t know a great deal about their medical histories, to be honest. I'm afraid I can't be much help there.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some nerve issues, but a definitive diagnosis was never made. And limited information about the rest of your family's medical history. Now, let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a month. But I wouldn’t say I drink, if you understand me. And definitely no recreational drugs. I… lead a fairly quiet life, to be honest. Mostly work and… trying to relax. It’s been difficult lately, with everything going on, but… no, no smoking, no drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or drug use, and only occasional alcohol consumption. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics in the past, for… infections, and I’ve never had any trouble. I do have… sensitive skin, sometimes, but that’s more of an annoyance than an allergy, I suppose. No, no known allergies. I can’t think of anything that I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for providing me with all this information, Mr. Schaust. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. We'll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll assess your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. I'll also take a closer look at your eyes and your skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I just hope you can figure out what’s going on. It’s been rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Let's begin. Please have a seat on the examination table. Your blood pressure is 128/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That's all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to assess your muscle strength. I'll ask you to resist as I push against your arms and legs. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Starting with your arms… can you please extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Here you go. Just let me know if there’s anything you want me to do differently. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, please try to resist as I push down. And then we'll repeat on the other side. Alright, I'm noticing a bit of weakness in both arms, slightly more so on the left. Now, let's move on to your legs. Can you please sit with your legs dangling off the table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here they are. Let me know when you're ready. I hope this isn’t too… obvious. I have been feeling rather unsteady, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you resist as I push against your ankles and knees?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m trying. It’s… a bit harder than it looks, if I'm honest. I can feel the effort. Is this what you expected?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I was observing as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. We’ll start with your knees. Please relax your legs, and I'll tap your knees with this small hammer. Alright. That's a bit diminished, on both sides. Finally, I’m going to check your eye movements and pupillary response. Please follow my finger with your eyes as I move it around. Okay, your eye movements appear normal. Everything seems to be intact there. Based on what I've observed during the physical exam and the history you’ve provided, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Your symptoms – muscle weakness, drooping eyelids, and fatigue – could be indicative of a condition affecting the neuromuscular junction. It could be something like Myasthenia Gravis, but we need to run some tests to confirm.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? What… what does that involve? Is it… serious? I must confess, Doctor, I'm rather anxious now. I don’t like the sound of that at all. What sort of tests are we talking about? And what happens if it is that?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schaust, and it’s perfectly natural to feel concerned. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, leading to weakness and fatigue. It's not necessarily life-threatening, but it can be chronic and requires management. To confirm the diagnosis, we'll need to run some blood tests to check for specific antibodies and possibly an Electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. There's also a special test called the Edrophonium test, where we administer a medication to temporarily improve muscle strength if Myasthenia Gravis is present. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, treatment options are available. These can include medications to suppress the immune system and improve nerve-muscle communication, and in some cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland. It's manageable, and many people with this condition live full and active lives. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these tests or treatment options?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot to take in. Blood tests I understand, that sounds reasonable. But the… EMG and the Edrophonium test… what do they involve exactly? Are they painful? And how long would I have to wait for the results? I must confess, the thought of surgery is… unsettling, to say the least. I suppose the most important thing is to find out what's causing this. But I'd appreciate it if you could explain those tests in a little more detail. And… what if it isn’t Myasthenia Gravis? What else could it be?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schaust. Let’s break down those tests. The Electromyography, or EMG, involves inserting a very small needle into your muscles to record their electrical activity. It’s not entirely painless, but most people describe it as a brief discomfort, similar to a muscle cramp. It’s a valuable tool for assessing muscle function and identifying any underlying nerve issues. The Edrophonium test involves injecting a medication into your vein. This medication temporarily blocks an enzyme that breaks down a chemical messenger used by your nerves and muscles. If you have Myasthenia Gravis, the medication should improve your muscle strength for a short period. We'll carefully monitor you during the test for any side effects. As for what else it could be, other possibilities include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which is similar to Myasthenia Gravis, or other neurological conditions. It's also possible that it could be related to a medication you’re taking, although you mentioned not taking any regularly. We’ll consider all possibilities and conduct further investigations if necessary. I’m going to order the blood tests now and schedule you for an EMG next week. We can discuss the Edrophonium test once we have the results from the other tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Blood tests and the EMG next week. I suppose that’s the best course of action. I will try to remain calm and… optimistic, although it’s difficult, to be honest. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? I do lead a rather active lifestyle, and I wouldn’t want to exacerbate the condition, if that’s possible. And… is there any reading material you could recommend? I tend to worry, and perhaps a little information would help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schaust. It’s completely understandable to want to be proactive. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity that exacerbates your weakness or fatigue. Rest is important, and it’s best to listen to your body. As for reading material, I can provide you with some reputable websites and brochures about Myasthenia Gravis and other neuromuscular conditions. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America website is an excellent resource: [https://www.mgfa.org/]. It provides comprehensive information about the condition, treatment options, and support resources. I also have some brochures here in the office that I can give you. I’m going to write you a note excusing you from strenuous activity for the next week, just in case. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the test results. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. The website and the brochures are much appreciated. I will certainly have a look at those. No, I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. You've been very thorough, and I feel… a little less anxious, although still worried, naturally. Thank you again for your time and your attention, Doctor Reisig. I appreciate it more than I can say.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
