DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, alright? Just… my stomach. It’s been puffed up. Feels like I swallowed a balloon, or something. It’s annoying, that’s all. Honestly, I don’t usually bother with doctors for… this kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're feeling bloated and it’s causing you discomfort. And I appreciate you coming in despite not usually seeing a doctor for these things. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on as quickly as possible. When did you first notice the bloating, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really remember. A while ago, I guess. Maybe… a few weeks? It comes and goes. Look, I work long hours, alright? Pile driving isn’t exactly a job where you sit around keeping track of when your stomach puffs up. It's just… there sometimes. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. A few weeks of intermittent bloating… alright. And would you say it's constant when it is there, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: Fluctuates, definitely. Worse after I eat, I think. Though, what doesn’t make me feel a bit… off after I eat, these days? It’s just… heavier, you know? Like I’ve got a brick in there. Then it kinda… eases up. It’s not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse after eating, feels like fullness or a heavy sensation, and eases up over time, but isn’t necessarily painful. That's good to know. Are there any specific foods that seem to trigger it more than others, or does it happen regardless of what you eat?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t pay attention to that stuff. I eat when I can, what's available. Mostly just… whatever keeps me going. Sandwiches, leftovers, sometimes something from the diner down the road. It’s not like I’m making a gourmet meal every night, alright? I’m a pile driver, not a chef. I doubt it's the food. It's probably just… something.
DOCTOR: I understand. You have a physically demanding job and don't have a lot of time to focus on food choices. That's perfectly alright. Okay. Besides the bloating, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? Look, I’m not usually one for… complaining. I work, I sleep, I try not to think about things too much. I guess… maybe a bit tired, but that’s just the job, right? And… sometimes my stomach gurgles. A lot. More than usual, maybe. Is that a symptom? Honestly, I don’t know what counts as a symptom.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine. It’s good you're telling me about the tiredness and increased gurgling, even if you're not sure if they're related. Increased gurgling and fatigue along with the bloating… alright. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, you're really getting into the details, aren't you? Look, I don’t… I don’t really discuss this with people. Everything's… normal enough. Maybe a little… looser than usual, sometimes. But again, could be the food. Could be anything. Is this going to take much longer? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m asking too many personal questions, Mr. Kristofik. I need to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on. It's good you mentioned looser stools. Just a few more questions, then I'll do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No vomiting. No. And weight loss? I haven't been trying to lose weight. Probably haven’t gained any, either, if that's what you're asking. I eat enough to keep going, alright? Look, I'm a big guy, I need fuel. No, no nausea, no vomiting, no weight loss. Can we just… get this over with? I'm starting to feel like I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss. Alright. I understand your frustration and I appreciate you sticking with me. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and gently palpate it, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… try not to poke around too much. And be quick about it, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I'm listening now. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, maybe? It’s just… pressure, alright? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discomfort with palpation, described as a dull ache. That’s helpful information. I noticed some mild distention of your abdomen, which correlates with your report of bloating. I also hear some increased bowel sounds, which could be related to the gurgling you mentioned. There’s no significant tenderness to the touch other than the general discomfort you described. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it's possible this could be related to a number of things, including increased gas production, mild indigestion, or a sensitivity to certain foods. However, given the duration and the looser stools, I’d like to order a couple of tests to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. Look, I really don’t have time for tests. Can’t you just… give me something for the gas? Or tell me to cut out dairy or something? I really don’t want to spend my day off going to labs and waiting for results.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. I wish I could just give you a quick fix, but it’s important to rule out any underlying issues. The tests I’m considering are a complete blood count to check for any signs of inflammation or infection, and a stool sample to look for any bacteria or parasites. These are fairly simple tests, and shouldn’t take up too much of your time. If everything comes back normal, we can certainly discuss dietary changes or over-the-counter medications for gas relief. But it’s better to be safe and rule out anything more serious first, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… tell me where to go, what I need to do. And make it quick. I really don't want to be doing this. I’m trusting you to not waste my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. I appreciate your trust, Mr. Kristofik. I'll write you a lab order now. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. You'll need to provide a stool sample – the lab will give you instructions on how to collect it – and they'll take some blood. I'll also give you a prescription for a medication called simethicone, which can help relieve gas and bloating in the meantime. It's over-the-counter, but I'll write you a prescription so it should be covered by your insurance. Once you have the results, you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or call the clinic and we can discuss them over the phone. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. 123 Main Street, got it. And the gas stuff… alright. As long as it works. Look, just… please don't make this complicated. I'm a pile driver, not a patient. Just get me back to work, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. My goal is to get you feeling better and back to work as quickly as possible. Here's the lab order and the prescription. The lab order has their phone number if you have any questions. If you don't hear from me within a week, please call the clinic to follow up on your results. And if your symptoms worsen at any time – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thanks, I guess. I’ll go do the tests and hopefully get this over with. Don't expect me back unless it’s absolutely necessary.
