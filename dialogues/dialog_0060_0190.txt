DOCTOR: Well, good afternoon. Lilyanna Snerling, is it?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor… Nooruddin, I believe? It’s a pleasure to meet you. Though, truthfully, I… I don’t recall making an appointment. But I suppose that’s not terribly unusual these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, appointments are confirmed, usually. It's rather disruptive when people simply… show up. Regardless. I have you down for a general check-up. But since you didn’t schedule this yourself, perhaps you could tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies, Doctor. Truly. It's just… things have been a bit foggy lately. I’m here because… well, I’ve been feeling quite unsteady on my feet. A bit wobbly, you might say. It’s… concerning, naturally, given my profession. I operate a rotary drill, and balance is rather important. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Though the specifics… are difficult to recall. It just feels like I might fall over sometimes, for no reason at all.
DOCTOR: “Foggy,” you say. Right. And this… wobbliness. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not… all the time. Some days I feel perfectly normal, and others… well, others I have to really concentrate just to walk across a room without stumbling. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, I think. Or… stressed. Though, to be honest, it’s hard to say for certain. Things blend together, you see. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it happens, or why.
DOCTOR: “Blends together,” yes. Well, we need to try and get some clarity. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, as I mentioned. And perhaps a bit… dizzy sometimes? Not a full-blown spin, but a sort of lightheadedness. And… oh, this is embarrassing… I’ve found it difficult to concentrate. I keep forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Names, where I put my keys… things like that. Though, with my profession, perhaps that's just the stress. It’s… a demanding job.
DOCTOR: Stress, naturally. Right. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Now that you mention it… perhaps a little bit. Things seem… less sharp, I think. Not blurry, exactly, but… muted? It’s hard to explain. It’s subtle. I haven’t really paid much attention to it, to be perfectly honest. I figured it was just my eyes getting tired from staring at the drill all day. Is that… a cause for concern? I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It's just... everything feels a little disconnected these days.
DOCTOR: “Disconnected.” Well, we’ll see. Now, let's go over some basic medical history. Any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… I… I had pneumonia when I was a child, I believe. A very bad case, but I recovered fully. And… oh, my late husband… he was unwell for quite some time before he passed. But that was several years ago now. As for surgeries… nothing major, to my knowledge. Perhaps a few wisdom teeth removed in my youth? It's difficult to remember specifics. It's all rather… hazy. Is it alright if I say that? It truly is. I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: “Hazy,” yes. Family history, then. Any history of neurological problems—dizziness, memory loss, weakness—in your family?
PATIENT: Neurological problems… My mother… she had some trouble with her balance in her later years, I believe. She would stumble sometimes, and had to use a cane towards the end. But she was quite elderly, so I assumed it was just part of aging. And… my paternal grandfather, I think, suffered from memory loss in his old age as well. Nothing severe, but he would forget things frequently. Is that… helpful information, Doctor? It feels like grasping at shadows, truly. I'm afraid my memory is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Right. And social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well… I was married, as I mentioned. My husband… passed away a few years ago. I live alone now. I work, of course. I don’t have much family nearby. I… I don’t really have many hobbies. Work takes up most of my time. I… I suppose that’s all. It’s rather… simple, really. Is there something specific you were hoping to find out, Doctor? I apologize if I’m not providing enough information. It’s just… my life has been fairly uneventful, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to any medications, as far as I can remember. And I don’t have any food allergies. I eat… fairly normally. Nothing unusual. I apologize if I’m being unhelpful, Doctor. It’s just… I've always been quite healthy, relatively speaking. I haven’t really had much need for medical attention in the past. Perhaps that’s why I’m struggling to recall anything specific. Is it alright if I say that?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Please stand up for me. I’ll check your balance and reflexes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything I should be aware of. I… I might need a little assistance, if you don't mind. It's just… I feel a bit unsteady today, as I’ve mentioned. I apologize for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Close your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m closing them now. It’s… a little difficult to balance, Doctor. I’m feeling quite unsteady. I apologize. Is it alright if I hold onto something? Perhaps the chair? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Marked instability. Romberg test positive. Patellar reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Bicep reflexes are also weak. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities, but decreased proprioception in the lower limbs. Now, please walk a straight line for me. Heel to toe, if you can.
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… very difficult, Doctor. I’m afraid I’m not very good at this. My legs feel… weak and uncoordinated. I apologize for the trouble. Is there anything wrong? I'm starting to feel quite worried.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Ataxic gait. Decreased coordination. Right. Now, sit back down. We need to run some blood tests and potentially order an MRI. It could be a number of things—Vitamin deficiency, neurological issues… we’ll need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Blood tests and… an MRI? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something… terribly wrong? I’m afraid I’m not understanding… what could be causing this? And… is it treatable? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m quite frightened. I’m starting to feel very unwell.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s too early to say definitively. We need the results of the tests. It could be something simple, like a B12 deficiency. But we need to rule out more serious possibilities, like multiple sclerosis or a brain tumor. I’m ordering a complete blood panel, including B12, folate, and thyroid levels. And I’m referring you for an MRI of the brain. I’ll give you a requisition for that. The lab will contact you to schedule the tests. Come back in two weeks with the results, and we’ll discuss them then. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks…? Oh dear. That… that seems a long time to wait, Doctor. Is there… anything I can do in the meantime? Are there any symptoms I should be watching for? And… is it possible… is it possible that it’s not serious? I apologize for being so frantic, but I’m quite frightened. I’m starting to feel very unwell, and the thought of waiting two weeks… is almost unbearable. .
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're anxious, but there's not much to do. I've ordered the necessary tests. If you develop any new symptoms—severe headache, vision changes, weakness on one side of your body—go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, try to stay calm and avoid strenuous activity. Now, I have other patients waiting. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
