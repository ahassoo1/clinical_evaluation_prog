DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my ear, Doctor. And my face, actually. It all started… let me see… yesterday morning, I think. I woke up and I just couldn’t hear out of my right ear. And the right side of my face… it feels kind of droopy. It’s very inconvenient, honestly. I have a luncheon to attend next week.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Inconvenient, you say. Yes, I understand. A sudden loss of hearing and facial droop… that is certainly concerning. To clarify, Ms. Nissenbaum, when you say “droopy,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t bother asking me to demonstrate. It’s… well, it’s just not as firm as the other side. When I smile, it pulls a bit. And when I try to close my eye, it doesn't shut completely. It's subtle, but I notice it. I have standards, you know.
DOCTOR: Standards, yes. I see. So, the weakness affects your ability to fully close your right eye and symmetrically smile. And this began yesterday morning. Has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never. I’ve always taken very good care of myself. Good diet, regular exercise… I can't imagine where this would come from. It’s… unsettling. And frankly, a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum. A sudden onset of these symptoms is unusual, given your reported healthy lifestyle. Let's proceed with a brief examination, if you would permit. I’d like to assess your cranial nerves, specifically those controlling facial movement and hearing. This will help me determine the potential cause. It won't be unpleasant, I assure you. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Well, as long as it's quick. I have things to do, you know. I don't have all day to sit here while you poke and prod. Just… get on with it, please. And try not to touch my hair.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please remain still and focus on me. First, I'm going to examine your ears with an otoscope. Hmm. The ear canal appears clear bilaterally. The tympanic membrane… appears normal in color and mobility. Now, let’s assess your facial muscles. Could you please raise your eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: Must I? Fine. There. Happy? It's a bit difficult, actually. My forehead feels… tight.
DOCTOR: I observe slight weakness on the right side. Now, could you please close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. You see? It doesn't shut all the way. It's quite noticeable, isn't it? Really, Doctor, this is dreadful. I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I concur. There is definite incomplete closure of the right eyelid. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Is that sufficient? It feels… unnatural. It's quite upsetting to be put on display like this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, based on this preliminary examination, your presentation is highly suggestive of Bell’s Palsy. This is a condition involving inflammation of the facial nerve, leading to weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. While often temporary, it requires prompt attention. Do you have any pain behind the ear, or any altered taste sensation on your tongue?
PATIENT: Altered taste? Good heavens, no. I have a very refined palate. Pain… well, a slight ache, perhaps. A dull throbbing, but honestly, I attribute that to the stress of all this. Bell’s… Palsy, you say? Is that… contagious?
DOCTOR: Contagious?
PATIENT: Well, is it? I certainly don't want to be spreading anything around. I have a luncheon next week, remember? With important people. One simply doesn't attend these things looking… compromised.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nissenbaum, Bell’s Palsy is not contagious. It is not caused by an infection. The precise cause is often unknown, though it's sometimes linked to viral illnesses. Now, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order an MRI of your brain. This will allow us to visualize the facial nerve and surrounding structures. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, the things one has to endure… Is it terribly uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: The MRI is generally well-tolerated, Ms. Nissenbaum. You will lie on a table inside a magnetic field, and it will be noisy. It typically takes around 30-45 minutes. It's non-invasive, meaning no injections or incisions are involved. However, it is essential for accurate diagnosis. Additionally, I will prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids. These can help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of a full recovery. Would you like me to arrange for the MRI and discuss the corticosteroid prescription?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Arrange the MRI, I suppose. But make it as quick as possible. And the… steroids. Are there side effects? I don’t want to gain weight. Honestly, the indignity of it all.
DOCTOR: Yes, corticosteroids can have side effects, Ms. Nissenbaum, such as increased appetite and temporary fluid retention. However, these are usually mild and resolve once the medication is stopped. We will monitor you closely. I will also provide you with eye drops to keep your right eye moist, as you may have difficulty blinking completely. The MRI will be scheduled at City Imaging. They will contact you directly to arrange a convenient time. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write the prescriptions?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I'm very careful about what I consume. And honestly, Doctor, I expect a full recovery. This is simply… unacceptable. It’s disrupting my schedule, and I have a reputation to uphold. Make sure they prioritize the MRI, alright? I don't have time for delays.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will ensure the MRI request is marked as urgent. I will also provide you with a prescription for the corticosteroids and lubricating eye drops. Here are the prescriptions. Please take the corticosteroids as directed, and use the eye drops several times a day to prevent dryness. If you experience any worsening symptoms—such as severe pain, vision changes, or difficulty speaking—please seek immediate medical attention. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week to assess your progress. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Honestly, I’m rather relieved to have that sorted. Just… please make sure everything is expedited. I have a luncheon to attend, you know. Thank you, Doctor. I trust you’ve taken appropriate notes.
DOCTOR: Indeed, Ms. Nissenbaum. All pertinent details have been documented. I trust you will follow the prescribed regimen diligently. I wish you a swift recovery. Should any concerns arise before your follow-up appointment, do not hesitate to contact the clinic. .
