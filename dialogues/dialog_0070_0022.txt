DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could start by telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me? Well, my tummy feels… puffy. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. Everything just… feels heavy, you know? I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Everything is a little fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Puffy” and feeling “heavy” – and a decreased appetite. It’s alright that the timing isn't clear; we can work through it. Could you describe the “puffiness” a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… it’s like… all of my belly is swollen. Not painful, exactly. Just… bigger. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t! It feels tight, sometimes, like my clothes are too small, even though they aren't. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. My head… it doesn't work like it used to.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. No need to apologize at all. “Swollen,” “tight,” and feeling like your clothes are smaller even though they haven't changed – that gives me a better picture. Has this swelling been getting worse gradually, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Oh… gradually, I think. Yes, that sounds right. It didn’t happen all at once. It just… grew, slowly. It’s hard to say how slowly, because, like I said, I don't pay attention to these things much anymore. I mostly just… sit and remember things. Old things, mostly. I don't recall noticing it a week ago, but maybe I didn't look a week ago!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. So, the swelling has developed gradually over some time. And you mentioned a decreased appetite. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the swelling and lack of appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, I get tired easily. Very easily. More than usual, I think. And sometimes my feet feel… puffy too! Not as bad as my tummy, but definitely swollen. It's funny, isn't it? Everything is getting puffy. And I have to… go to the bathroom a lot. More than before, I mean. But that could just be old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. Tiredness, swelling in your feet as well as your abdomen, and increased frequency of urination. It's good you mention all of these details, Ms. McConnon, even if you think they might just be from aging. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. That's a long time ago. Let me see… I think… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, many years ago. But the doctor said it was okay. He gave me some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them eventually. I don't remember what it was called. And… I had a bad flu once, a very bad one. But that was a long time ago too. I don’t think I’ve been to the doctor in… oh, a very long time. I mostly just try to stay quiet and not bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble in the past and a severe bout of the flu. And you haven’t been to the doctor in quite some time. Do you recall the name of any medications you may have taken for your heart, even if it was a long time ago?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don’t think so. Everything is so… blurry. Little white pills, maybe? Or perhaps blue? I truly don't recall. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. My memory just isn’t what it used to be. It’s like trying to catch smoke, you know? It disappears before you can hold onto it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. McConnon. Don't worry about it at all. We'll proceed as best we can. Now, can you tell me if anyone in your family has had similar medical problems—heart trouble, swelling, or kidney problems, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh… family. That was a long time ago too. My sister… she had trouble with her legs. Swelling, like mine. But that was a very long time ago, and I was very young. She lived far away, and we didn’t see each other much. My mother… she was a strong woman. Very strong. I don't remember her being sick. And my father… he was a quiet man. He didn’t talk much about his health. I’m sorry. I wish I could tell you more, but my family… it’s all just a distant memory.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. We're doing the best we can with the information we have. Let's move onto your social history, if you don’t mind. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I live alone. Have for… oh, many years now. My husband… he passed away a long time ago. A very good man. We had a small house, not fancy. I mostly just… stay inside and read. And remember things. I don't have many visitors. My neighbors are kind, they bring me groceries sometimes. But I like my quiet. It's peaceful.
DOCTOR: I understand. You live alone, and prefer a quiet life. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. No smoking, no drinking. Never liked it. My husband didn't either. We preferred tea, and a quiet evening with a book. Always tea. Earl Grey, usually. Or sometimes chamomile. It’s good for calming the nerves, you know. I still drink tea, every day. A small cup, just enough to warm my hands.
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see… I don't think so. I never had any trouble with anything, not that I recall. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen sometimes, but that’s just the springtime. Nothing serious. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. But… you know… my memory. It's not always reliable. I suppose it's best to be careful, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and checking your feet for swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Well… alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. But be gentle, please? My old bones are a bit… fragile. And don't mind if I close my eyes. I get a little… scared sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. And you can absolutely close your eyes if that makes you more comfortable. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take slow, deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but regular. I hear some faint crackling sounds in the lower parts of your lungs, especially on your right side. That could indicate some fluid buildup. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended, and there's some fluid present. It doesn't appear to be acutely painful. Finally, let's take a look at your feet. Yes, as you mentioned, there is some significant swelling in both feet, particularly around the ankles. This is what we call edema. Okay, Ms. McConnon. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, I'm concerned about possible fluid retention, which could be related to several things, including heart, kidney, or liver problems. It's difficult to say definitively without some further testing.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… worrying. Fluid retention? Heart, kidney, liver… those all sound very serious. What kind of testing do I need, Doctor? Will it hurt? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to feel better. My tummy is so uncomfortable, and I’m so tired all the time. Is there anything I can do right now to help? Perhaps a nice cup of tea?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon. It's good you're asking questions. The testing isn't meant to frighten you; it’s to help us understand what’s causing your symptoms so we can address them effectively. We’ll need to run some blood tests to check your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and to rule out any infection. We’ll also need a urine sample. And I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity. The blood tests and urine sample will involve a simple needle prick, and the EKG is completely painless – it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. Regarding feeling better right now, a cup of tea is always a good idea! However, in terms of your symptoms, the fluid retention is what we need to investigate. I'm also going to recommend a low-sodium diet, starting today. This will help reduce the amount of fluid your body retains. I can have a dietician come speak with you about this. To get these tests underway, I'll have my nurse draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… more tests. It’s all a bit much, isn’t it? But… alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. A low-sodium diet… I don’t even know what that means! And a dietician… that sounds very helpful. Yes, please, a dietician would be wonderful. A needle prick… well, I suppose I can manage that. I’ve had worse, I think. Yes, alright. Let’s get the tests done. The sooner we know what’s wrong, the better. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. McConnon. It's my pleasure to help. And please, don't underestimate yourself - you are not just “an old woman.” You’re a patient seeking care, and I will do everything I can to provide that care. Excellent. I’ll have the nurse come in right away to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant weight gain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… chest pain… significant weight gain. Oh dear, that sounds frightening. I will remember that, Doctor. Thank you for telling me. Hmm… questions? Yes, actually. What… what if the tests show something… serious? Will I… will I be alright? I don't want to be a burden to anyone. And… will it hurt? It’s silly, I know, but I can’t help but worry.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly natural to be worried when facing uncertainty. That's why you're here – to get answers and peace of mind. If the tests do reveal something serious, we will discuss all your options thoroughly. We’ll explore the best course of treatment, taking into account your age, overall health, and your wishes. There are many treatments available for various conditions, and we’ll work together to find the one that’s right for you. And I assure you, you would not be a burden. My team and I are here to support you every step of the way. As for whether it will hurt, that depends on the condition, of course. But we’ll always do everything we can to minimize discomfort and manage any pain effectively. We’ll also discuss pain management options, if needed. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. And remember, I'm here to answer all your questions, no matter how small they may seem. I’ll leave you to rest for a moment, and the nurse will be in shortly. Do you need anything before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For being so kind and patient with an old woman. And… please, call me Soila. Doctor Abady… it sounds so… formal. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the nurse. And try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it very much. .
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Soila. And please, call me Jaso. I’ll leave you to rest. Don't hesitate to ring the call button if you need anything at all. .
