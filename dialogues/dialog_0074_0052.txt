DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet ye as well. Well, I've been havin' a bit o' trouble wi' mornin' sickness, o' all things. Seems a bit daft for a man my age, but there ye go. It's been goin' on for a couple o' weeks now, and it’s mostly just feelin' queasy when I wake up. It's a bit botherin', seein' as how I’ve got a bit o' a weak heart, and I don’t want to be pushin' it.
DOCTOR: That is unusual, Mr. Benic, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention, especially with your heart condition. It's good you're being proactive. When you say "mornin' sickness," could you describe the queasiness a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not like the stories ye hear, not really vomitin' or anything. Just a right uncomfortable feelin' in me stomach, ye ken? Like I've eaten somethin' that didn't agree wi' me, but I haven't. It usually starts right after I wake up, before I’ve even had a bite o' breakfast. It lasts maybe an hour or so, then fades away. It's just…worryin', that's all. It's a bit different than the usual heart palpitations I get, and I don't want it to be somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's wise to investigate anything new, especially given your cardiac history. So, it's primarily nausea, without vomiting, that begins shortly after waking and resolves within an hour. And you've noticed this is different from your usual heart palpitations. Just to clarify, when you say heart palpitations, could you describe what those feel like for you?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right, precisely. The palpitations… well, it's like a flutterin' in me chest, ye see? Like a wee bird trapped in there, tryin' to get oot. It doesn't always happen, but when it does, it feels like me heart's racin’ a bit. Sometimes it's just a quick thump, other times it goes on for a minute or so. This mornin' sickness, though, it’s a different beast altogether. It’s more… a sickly feelin' in me stomach, not a flutter in me chest. It's a bit hard to explain, but it's definitely not the same. I’ve been takin’ me medication for the heart, as usual, but this… this is new.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Benic. It's helpful to understand the distinction between the two sensations. And you are keeping up with your heart medication as prescribed?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. Every mornin’ and evenin', like clockwork. I’ve got a wee pill organiser, so I don't forget. The chemist does it for me, fills it up every month. I’ve never missed a dose, not intentionally, anyway. I'm very careful wi' it, seein’ as how the doctor said it’s important. It usually keeps the palpitations under control. It's just… this mornin’ sickness is throwin’ me for a loop, because it's somethin’ entirely different. I’m a bit worried it might be somethin' related to the heart, even though it doesn’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're so diligent with your medication. And it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about a potential cardiac connection, given your history. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Of course, go ahead. I’ll do whatever ye think is best. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I trust yer judgement. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do, or if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of doctors, to be fair, but I know ye're tryin’ to help.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. It shouldn’t be painful at all. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Here ye go. I always get a bit anxious when they wrap that thing around me arm. Makes me feel a bit squashed, if I’m honest. I suppose it’s just the anticipation. Is everything alright so far? I feel fine, just a bit…queasy, like I said. It’s not a strong feelin’, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/85, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds… regular rhythm, but a slightly diminished sound overall. Lungs are clear. I'm also going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Hm, well, that's not surprisin', I suppose. Me blood pressure’s always been a bit up and down. And I can feel ye pressin', aye, but no real pain. It's… a bit tender, maybe, right here. Not sharp pain, mind ye, just a wee bit uncomfortable. It's been like that for a few days now, actually. I just put it down to indigestion, to be honest. I've been eatin' a bit o' rich food lately, but it's not gettin' any better. Is that somethin' to worry about?
DOCTOR: That tenderness in the upper center of your abdomen is noted. It could be related to indigestion, but given your history and the unusual presentation of this “morning sickness,” it's worth investigating further. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. These blood tests will help us check your overall health, look for any signs of infection, and assess your liver and kidney function. We'll also check your amylase and lipase levels to rule out any issues with your pancreas. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever ye think is best. I'd rather be safe than sorry, as I said. Blood tests it is, then. I don't mind a wee prick if it means gettin' to the bottom o' this. Will I need to fast for these tests, or can I eat as normal? I've got a bit o' a sweet tooth, ye see, and I’d hate to have to deny meself me biscuit wi' me tea.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. So, no biscuits with your tea before then, unfortunately. It’s best to have an empty stomach for the most accurate results. The lab technician will give you specific instructions when you go for the draw. I'll send the order to the lab electronically, and they should be able to schedule you for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding rich foods and staying hydrated. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Aye, that's fine. No biscuit it is, then. I can manage that, just about. Eight hours, ye say? Right, I’ll make a note o' that. Avoiding rich foods… that might be a bit harder, but I’ll give it me best shot. Hydrated, aye, I can do that. I drink plenty o' tea, as it is. So, blood tests tomorrow mornin', and we’ll see what they say. Thank ye, Doctor. Ye’ve put me mind at ease a bit, just by listenin'. I appreciate it. Is there anything else I need to do, or anythin' I should be lookin' out for in the meantime?
