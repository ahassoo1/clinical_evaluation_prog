DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a little…jumpstart, perhaps? I’m hoping you can help me feel more like myself again. It’s difficult to explain, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Stuck” is a good way to put it, and it’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to explain. We'll take our time and figure it out together. When did you start feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It didn't happen overnight, certainly. Perhaps… six months ago? It was gradual. I just felt… less energy, less motivation. Things started to feel… heavier, if that makes sense. It’s been slowly worsening, I suppose. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact moment.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful – knowing it was gradual is important. Six months ago, and slowly worsening… okay. And you mentioned less energy and motivation, and things feeling “heavier.” Can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by “heavier”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not physical, not exactly. It's… like everything requires so much effort. Simple tasks. Things I used to enjoy. Even getting out of bed some mornings. It’s like there’s a weight on my spirit, Doctor. It’s difficult to describe. And I find myself… withdrawing. Spending more time alone. Not wanting to socialize as much. It’s not that I don't want to, it just… feels overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Ms. Pitzel. It's good you're recognizing these changes and coming in to address them. Feeling overwhelmed and withdrawing socially definitely points to something we need to explore. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite during this time?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep… it's become quite erratic. Some nights I can’t fall asleep at all, other nights I sleep for ten or twelve hours and still wake up feeling exhausted. And my appetite… it’s all over the place. Some days I have no interest in eating, and other days I find myself craving… well, not necessarily healthy things. More comfort foods, I suppose. Chocolate, pastries… things like that. It’s a bit of a cycle, really. The more tired I am, the more I crave those things, and then I feel worse afterward.
DOCTOR: Okay, erratic sleep and fluctuating appetite, with a tendency towards comfort foods when you're feeling down… that's useful information. Now, outside of these changes, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little more… forgetful, I think. Not major things, but misplacing keys, forgetting appointments… things like that. And… this might sound odd, but I haven’t been enjoying my work as much. I usually find my shaping and casting very… therapeutic, but lately it feels like a chore. It’s like the joy has been… muted. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. Increased forgetfulness and a loss of enjoyment in activities you previously found fulfilling are both important things to note. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like depression, anxiety, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been… quite healthy, generally. I had a bout of the flu a few years ago, and a broken wrist when I was younger, but nothing serious. No diagnosed conditions, no major illnesses. I do have a family history of… high blood pressure, on my mother’s side, but I’ve always been careful with my diet and exercise. I try to stay active, though it’s been harder lately, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses and a family history of high blood pressure. That's good to know. And you mentioned trying to stay active. Can you tell me a little bit about your typical daily routine and level of exercise before you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: Well, I work from home, mostly. I have a small studio where I do my shaping and casting. Before… before this started, I would typically get up around seven, have a light breakfast, and spend most of the day working. I’d take breaks to walk my dog, a lovely little chihuahua named Coco, and I’d try to go for a longer walk in the evenings, maybe a mile or two. And I used to attend a pottery class once a week, which I really enjoyed. It was very social, and a good creative outlet. I’d also help my husband, Eduardo, with the gardening. We grow a lot of our own vegetables. We've always been quite busy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a busy routine involving work, walking, pottery, and gardening. And now?
PATIENT: Now… it’s drastically different. I still get up around seven, but I have trouble getting started with my work. I often find myself procrastinating, just… staring at my materials. The walks with Coco are shorter, much shorter. I haven’t been to pottery class in months. I feel too… drained. And the gardening… Eduardo has been doing most of it on his own. I try to help when I can, but I don’t have the energy. It’s… very disheartening, really. I feel like I’m letting everyone down. I'm not myself at all.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Ms. Pitzel. It’s understandable that you’re feeling disheartened. It sounds like this has significantly impacted your daily life. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I generally try to avoid medications if I can. I believe in a natural approach to health, if that makes sense. I take a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I’ll take some ginger tea for an upset stomach, but that’s about it. I don’t take any prescription medications. Eduardo takes something for his blood pressure, but that’s his concern. I’m very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I've occasionally had a mild rash from mosquito bites, but nothing serious. No known allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s all very helpful, Ms. Pitzel. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel… better.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I'll listen to your lungs and check your thyroid. I’ll also take a look in your ears and throat, and do a quick neurological exam – just to check your reflexes and coordination. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs sound clear and open bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No nodules or tenderness. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. Everything seems physically normal so far, Ms. Pitzel. Which, while reassuring, doesn't explain how you're feeling. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it's sounding like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That… that makes sense, actually. Depression… I’ve always thought of that as something… dramatic, I suppose. But now that you mention it… the lack of energy, the loss of joy, the withdrawal… it all fits. Yes, Doctor, please, order the blood work. Whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. I just want to feel like myself again. And thank you for listening. It’s… a relief to finally say these things out loud.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It takes courage to open up, and I’m glad you feel comfortable talking with me. And you are right to be proactive about getting to the bottom of this. Okay, I’ll order the blood work right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you quickly. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, is there anything that usually helps you relax or feel a little bit better, even if it's just for a few minutes?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. Well… when I’m feeling up to it, I enjoy gardening. Being surrounded by nature… it always calms me. And I used to love listening to music – classical music, mostly. It’s been difficult to find the motivation lately, but those things usually help. And spending time with Eduardo, of course. He’s very supportive. Just… being near him makes me feel a little bit better, even when I’m feeling down.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Pitzel. Those are all good things to hold onto. Even small moments of joy and connection can make a difference. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a handout with some resources for depression and anxiety, just in case. It includes information about support groups and online resources. And if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of harming yourself, please don't hesitate to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The number is 988. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. That pamphlet is very helpful, thank you. You’ve been very thorough and… kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and taking my concerns seriously. I’m… cautiously optimistic. I think I’ll go get the blood work done now. Thank you again, Dr. Asami. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad I could help. And I share your optimism. We'll work through this together. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
