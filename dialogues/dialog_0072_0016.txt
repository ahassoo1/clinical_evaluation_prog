DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… alright. Look, it’s this bruising. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, since… well, since my wife passed. And I bump into things, normal stuff, but now I’m black and blue for weeks. It’s embarrassing, honestly. A man shouldn’t be walking around like a plum.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It’s certainly concerning when bruising becomes excessive, especially with being on a blood thinner. You mentioned this started after your wife’s passing… and you’ve noticed it with even minor bumps?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Before, a little knock, maybe a small bruise for a day or two. Now? I swear, I looked at a fern the wrong way last week and had a mark on my arm for three days. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. And frankly, it makes me worry. Is the medicine doing something wrong? Are they giving me too much? I always thought doctors were supposed to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: It is our responsibility to ensure medications are appropriately managed, Mr. Farson. However, bruising with anticoagulation is multifactorial. We need to explore all possibilities before attributing it solely to the medication. Let's start with a thorough history. You said this began after your wife's passing. Has anything else changed in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Well, obviously my wife died. What kind of question is that? Everything changed! My whole life flipped upside down. I… I don't know what you want me to say. I started eating more takeout, maybe? I haven’t been doing my usual gardening. Honestly, I just haven’t been up to much. It's not like I'm experimenting with new hobbies that involve getting beat up, if that's what you're implying. This is about the bruising, Doctor, not my emotional state.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, while I appreciate your… directness, changes in lifestyle can absolutely contribute to bruising. Diet, activity level, even stress can play a role. We’re trying to get a complete picture here. Now, regarding your diet - more takeout… what does that typically consist of?
PATIENT: Look, I eat what I want, alright? Burgers, fries, sometimes a little steak. It’s not like I’m living on a diet of kale and sunshine. I’m a grown man, and I don’t need to report my eating habits to anyone. Is this some kind of lecture? I came here because I’m bruising, not because I need a nutritionist. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming in. A little bit of a bump and now I'm being interrogated about my lunch. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I assure you, this is not an interrogation. A comprehensive medical evaluation requires gathering pertinent information. Your dietary intake is relevant, as certain foods can interfere with medication efficacy or contribute to bleeding risk. If you’re unwilling to provide a straightforward answer, it will be difficult to determine the cause of your bruising. Now, let's try this another way. Are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements – even occasionally?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re getting condescending. Fine. Yes, I take a little vitamin C. Helps with the… well, never mind. And sometimes I take aspirin for a headache. It's just a regular aspirin, the kind you buy at the drugstore. Is that going to cause a scandal now? You’re making a mountain out of a molehill, Doctor. I just want to know why I’m looking like I went ten rounds with a heavyweight boxer. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: The aspirin is significant, Mr. Farson. Even occasional use can potentiate the effects of your anticoagulant. And while Vitamin C is generally safe, it’s important to be aware of all supplements. Now, to proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, and examining the areas where you’ve experienced bruising. Is that acceptable?
