DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, good to see you. Though I must say, you're looking a little... frail. Now, you're 83 years young, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Eighty-three. Though time… it slips away, doesn’t it? I suppose the important thing is I’m here. And frankly, I expect a certain level of… competence. My father always said a man should demand the best from his service providers. Especially when dealing with… delicate matters.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, I assure you, Mr. Krok, I am quite competent. Though, with all due respect to your father, “delicate matters” is a rather vague description. Let's start with why you've come in today. What’s been troubling you?
PATIENT: Troubling me? Oh, goodness. It’s… a discharge. Yes. A… a leaking, if you will. It’s most unpleasant. And quite… undignified for a man of my standing. I’ve never experienced anything quite like it, and I assure you, I’ve lived a full life. It started… well, I honestly can’t recall when exactly. A few weeks, perhaps? Time, you see. It's all rather blurry.
DOCTOR: A discharge… right. And where precisely is this discharge coming from, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Goodness, must we be so… blunt? It’s… down there. From my… private parts. Honestly, Doctor, I thought a gentleman didn't need to specify. It’s rather obvious, isn't it? And it’s… yellowish. A most unattractive shade, I must say. It stains the… undergarments. Very bothersome.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We are here for medical reasons, Mr. Krok. And specifics are rather important. Yellowish discharge… has it any odor?
PATIENT: Odor? Hmm. Let me see… Yes, I believe there is a smell. Not a pleasant one, naturally. It’s… fishy. Though I’ve never smelled a fish quite so… intimate, if you understand my meaning. My wife complains, naturally. She has a rather sensitive nose. And a talent for complaining, frankly.
DOCTOR: Fishy odor, alright. And is there any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Not precisely pain, Doctor. More… discomfort. A slight stinging, occasionally. Especially after… well, after using the facilities. And a bit of irritation, yes. It's not crippling, mind you. But it's certainly not comfortable. A man of my age deserves a bit of comfort, don't you think? I've endured enough hardships in my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven’t felt feverish. Though my wife does tend to worry about everything. She's convinced I’m always on the verge of some terrible illness. Chills, no. And my back… well, my back always aches. A man who has spent a lifetime working with farm equipment is bound to have a bad back, don't you think? It's simply part of life.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! At my age? Really. That’s a rather… personal question, don't you think? While I appreciate your thoroughness, some things are best left unsaid. My wife is quite enough activity for one lifetime, thank you very much. And frankly, it’s rather… undignified to even ask.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don’t believe so. I’ve always been a rather robust fellow. A bit of a strong constitution, you see. Though my wife claims I’m allergic to common sense sometimes. But that’s neither here nor there. I recall a slight rash once, decades ago, after eating some… shellfish, perhaps? But it wasn’t serious. Nothing a bit of calamine lotion couldn’t fix.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a bit of aspirin now and again, for the joints. And my wife insists I take some… fish oil, for the brain, she says. Though I doubt it does much good at my age. And perhaps a bit of something for the… digestion. I can't recall the name, frankly. She manages the medications, you see. A very organized woman, my wife. Perhaps too organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick examination, Mr. Krok. It’s necessary to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh. Well. I suppose it's unavoidable, isn't it? Though I must say, I’m not entirely comfortable with the idea. A man doesn't relish having his… private parts examined. But if it’s necessary… I suppose it’s necessary. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. And discreet, if you please. A man has his dignity, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Discretion is assured. Please, if you would lie down on the table. I’ll need to take a look. And I may need to collect a sample, just to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: A sample, you say? Oh dear. This is becoming rather… unpleasant. Very well. But I must warn you, Doctor, I’m not a young man. And my… facilities aren't what they used to be. Just… try to be gentle, if you please. And perhaps avert your gaze a little? A man deserves a bit of privacy, even during a medical examination.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I’ll give you some privacy to change. I’ll be just outside when you're ready. And I assure you, I have seen… everything. It's part of the job. Please, take your time.
PATIENT: “Seen everything,” she says. Well, that’s not particularly reassuring, is it? Honestly, the indignity of it all. A man should be allowed to face his twilight years with a little… decorum. Very well. Let’s get this over with. And quickly, if you please.
