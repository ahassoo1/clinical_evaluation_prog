DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, it’s my breath. It smells…bad. Really bad. I don’t need a long explanation of why I’m here, do I? It’s pretty self-explanatory. I just want something to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is pretty self-explanatory. And no, you don’t need a long explanation at all. We'll get to the bottom of it. It's good you came in. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. It’s probably been…a while. A few months, maybe? I mean, I work outside all day, fixing roads. It’s not like I’m sitting around smelling my own breath, okay? It's just…people have been making faces. That’s how I know. And frankly, it’s rude of them not to just tell me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to address something like this. And you’re right, people should be more direct. Now, a few months is a bit of time. Has anything changed in your routine around that time?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Work’s the same, awful as always. I got divorced last year, so…less arguing, I guess. That’s a change. But I still get up, go to work, come home, sleep. No fancy vacations or anything. And I definitely don’t have time for…I don’t know…brushing my teeth ten times a day or whatever people do. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't take long, Zelina. We’ll try to figure this out as quickly as possible. And you're right, brushing ten times a day isn't necessary! Let’s start with the basics. How often do you brush your teeth currently?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, are you going to judge me? Fine. Usually…once a day. Sometimes. Okay, sometimes. It’s not like I have a lot of free time. And floss? Don’t even. I don't bother with that nonsense. Happy now?
DOCTOR: No judgement at all, Zelina. Honestly. It’s good you’re being open with me. Knowing this helps me understand what's going on. Now, do you notice any particular foods that seem to make the breath worse?
PATIENT: Foods? Everything, probably. I eat what I can when I have time. Burgers, fries…sometimes I grab a pastry at the gas station. I don’t exactly have a chef preparing organic meals, okay? It all tastes the same when you're tired and covered in asphalt.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you have a demanding job and a busy life. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bad breath?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? No, not really. I'm always tired, but that's just…life. Sometimes my stomach feels a bit off, but that's probably the gas station pastries. I don't know. Nothing major. Is this going to involve a lot of tests? Because I really don't have time for that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Zelina. We'll try to keep things as efficient as possible. Before we talk about tests, let's do a quick exam. I'd like to take a look in your mouth and listen to your lungs, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…make it quick. I have things to do. Really, I do. And don't tell me I have a cavity, okay? I can’t deal with that right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just open wide for me… and try to relax. Okay, everything seems relatively clear. Your lungs sound good, and I don't see any obvious cavities. Your gums are a little inflamed, and your tongue has a bit of a coating, which could contribute to the odor. It looks like you might have early signs of gingivitis.
PATIENT: Gingiva-what? Look, is that what’s making my breath smell bad? And what do I do about it? Do I need surgery or something? Because if I do, I'm leaving. Seriously. I have a road to pave.
DOCTOR: No surgery at all, Zelina, absolutely not. Gingivitis is just inflammation of the gums, usually caused by a buildup of plaque. It’s very common, and usually easily treatable. It can cause bad breath, yes. The good news is, it’s not serious at this stage, and we can address it with improved oral hygiene. I recommend brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, and starting to floss regularly. It may be uncomfortable at first, but it will help remove the plaque and bacteria. We can also talk about a mouthwash. Would you like me to show you the proper brushing and flossing technique?
PATIENT: Fine. Show me. But make it quick. And don’t judge my brushing. I told you, I don’t have a lot of free time. And honestly, I probably won’t do it twice a day. Once is the best I can promise.
DOCTOR: Alright, so gentle circles, making sure to get all surfaces. And with the floss, you’re just gently sliding it up and down, curving it around each tooth. It’s about removing the plaque, not about hurting your gums. Remember, even once a day is a good start. We’re aiming for improvement, not perfection. And if it’s too difficult to floss regularly, we can talk about interdental brushes, which are easier for some people. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I get it. Circles and floss. It's not rocket science. Look, can I go now? I really, really need to get back to work. Is there anything else I need to do? Like, take pills or something? Because if there is, I’m leaving. I’m not a fan of taking pills.
DOCTOR: No pills, I promise. No need for medication at this stage. Just focus on improving your oral hygiene, and that should help significantly. I would recommend avoiding sugary drinks and snacks, as those contribute to plaque buildup. And if you notice any bleeding gums or persistent bad breath despite improving your hygiene, please come back and see me. Here's a pamphlet on proper oral hygiene, with diagrams and tips. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you. Seriously. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have roads to pave.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina. You take care, and feel free to reach out if you have any concerns. I hope you have a productive day. And remember, even small improvements can make a big difference. .
