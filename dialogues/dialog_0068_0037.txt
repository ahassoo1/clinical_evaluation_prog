DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. It is nice to meet you. I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not sure the exact date.
DOCTOR: Alright, wheezing… a few weeks. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about this wheezing?
PATIENT: Hmm. It comes and goes. When I walk up the stairs, it gets worse. Or if I try to do my exercises. I like to walk, you know, to stay strong. But then I have to stop and… catch my breath. It feels tight in my chest. Not pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Tightness in the chest with exertion… alright. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Yes. When I sit down and rest, it gets better. And… if I take a warm shower, it helps a little. Not a lot, but some. Does that make sense, Doctor? I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mrs. Kilton. Rest and warm showers providing some relief… good to know. Now, have you had a fever, cough, or any chest pain at all with this?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. And… no cough. Just the wheezing. And like I said, not pain, just… tightness. It is strange. It is not like a bad pain, just… hard to breathe. I worry a little, because my husband… he had problems breathing before he passed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your husband’s history. We’ll certainly look into this thoroughly. Now, let's just quickly go through some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, but that is all. The doctor gave it to me years ago. I am not sure if that matters. I do not eat peanuts, but that is because I do not like them, not because I am allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies… blood pressure medication. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. I… I do not remember the name. I just take the little white pill every morning. The doctor told me what it was, but it was a long time ago. I have trouble remembering things these days. Maybe my daughter knows. She helps me with these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can try to get that information from your daughter later. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… years ago, when I was younger, I had a very bad flu. I was in the hospital for a few days. But that was a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a child. But that is all I can think of. Nothing serious in a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu as a young adult, broken arm as a child. And your family history – are there any breathing problems, like asthma or COPD, that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is a good question. My brother… he had some trouble with his lungs when he was old. He smoked a lot, you see. But I never smoked. And my mother… she was very healthy, I think. I do not know about other family members. It was a long time ago. We did not talk about these things much. I am sorry I cannot be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels, if that’s alright with you. It will just take a few moments.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I hope it is not too serious. It is just… I get worried sometimes. But I am sure you will figure it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and breathe normally. Alright… a little bit of wheezing on both sides, especially when you exhale. Oxygen is a little low, at 92%. Heart sounds are normal. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 88. Your oxygen level is a little low, and I definitely hear wheezing in your lungs. We need to figure out what’s causing that. I think we should get a chest x-ray and a blood test to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it is necessary. I want to know what is going on. A chest x-ray and a blood test… yes, that is fine. Will it hurt? The blood test, I mean. I do not like needles. But I will do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: The blood test will just be a little prick, Mrs. Kilton. It won't hurt much, I promise. And the chest x-ray is completely painless. The technician will just take a picture of your lungs. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now, and then we'll send you down for the x-ray. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I am going to prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing. It will help you breathe easier. It’s a bronchodilator. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An inhaler… to help me breathe? That sounds good. Yes, please. A bron… what did you call it? It is a long word. And the blood test… how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I do not want to miss it. I am very competitive, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s a bronchodilator, Mrs. Kilton – it helps open up your airways. The nurse will explain how to use it. The blood test results usually take about 24-48 hours. I think you'll have them well before your bridge game. If anything changes, or you feel worse before then, please call the office immediately, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. 24 to 48 hours… that is good. And I will call if anything changes. Thank you very much. You have been very kind. I feel a little better just knowing what is going on. Now, do I go see the nurse now? For the blood test?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Kilton, please go see the nurse, and she’ll take care of the blood test. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and call you with the plan. And again, don't hesitate to call if anything worries you. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Sham. I will. I appreciate your help very much. Goodbye.
