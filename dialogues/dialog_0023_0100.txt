DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something to do with checking… things. Medicare sent me, honestly. I don’t really recall all the details. It's a bit fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Medicare can be… opaque, certainly. Let’s try to clarify. They sent you for a specific test?
PATIENT: I think it was a… a check for substances? Like, to see if I'm using anything I shouldn’t be. That sounds right, doesn’t it? It was all in a letter… a lot of paperwork. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I mostly just do what they tell me these days. Do you need me to sign something?
DOCTOR: Yes, it sounds like you’re referring to a toxicology screening. Standard procedure for new Medicare patients, unfortunately. It’s mostly to ensure appropriate prescribing, and frankly, to discourage misuse of the system. It’s quite bureaucratic. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or otherwise?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh! Yes, I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And… sometimes, if my arthritis is really acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind, you know? Nothing fancy. I don’t… I don’t really take much these days. Honestly, I try not to. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. Do you recall the name of your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s the tricky part. It’s… it’s a little white pill. I get it from the pharmacy down the street, you know, Miller’s? They just… give it to me when I ask. I don’t think I’ve ever really looked at the name on the bottle. Is that bad? I just tell them what the doctor said and they fill it. Should I be writing these things down? I feel terrible. I really should be more organized.
DOCTOR: It's…suboptimal, Ms. Hughston. While not ideal, it’s not uncommon. We need to determine what you're taking for accurate charting. Perhaps we can contact Miller’s pharmacy directly to obtain a list of your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful! Yes, please do! That would save me a lot of trouble. Miller’s… Mr. Miller is a nice man. He knows me pretty well, I think. That would be a lifesaver, truly. Then we can get this test done, right? Is it a blood test? I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a standard urine drug screen. It's non-invasive, thankfully. We'll just need a sample. Before we proceed with that, I’d like to ask a few standard questions regarding your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a runny nose when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s just seasonal. No medications, no foods… I don’t think so. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a child, but that was a long time ago and I don’t think I’m allergic anymore. Is that helpful? I try to avoid things that might bother me, just in case.
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies, seasonal allergies only, childhood bee sting without documented reaction. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, when I was younger… a long time ago… I had my appendix out. And… when I broke my arm, I think they put a cast on it. That was… probably when I was in my twenties. And… well, after my husband passed, I was in the hospital for a little while. Just… to get myself together, you know? It wasn't a surgery or anything, just… a lot of sadness. Is that what you mean? It was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details very well. Everything is a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy in youth, fracture requiring cast, hospitalization for grief following husband's passing. Ms. Hughston, this is important. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That's a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And… my father, he had some kind of heart trouble when he was older. But… they both lived to be quite old, actually. And my brother… he's perfectly healthy, as far as I know. But… we weren't very close, so I don’t really know much about his health. It’s all a bit… distant. Everyone is gone now, really. It was a long time ago. I’m not sure I can remember much detail. Is it important? It’s all so… sad, thinking about it.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, Ms. Hughston. Knowing about family history can assist in assessing potential risks. Now, regarding your social habits. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not anymore. My husband… he used to smoke a bit, but he stopped years ago. And we… well, we used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not much. And definitely no recreational drugs! Never touched them. I just want to get this test done and get on with my day. Is that… is that okay? I just want to make sure everything is alright. It’s all a bit stressful, you know?
