DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In my… testicles. It’s been on and off for a little while, but it’s been worse lately. I’m not quite sure why I’m having it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, no need to be embarrassed at all. That’s what I’m here for. "Down there" pain can be a lot of things, and we'll figure it out. You said it’s been on and off for a little while, and worse lately… can you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, usually. But sometimes it feels… heavy. Like a weight. And it seems to be worse after I’ve been… doing things around the house. You know, lifting wood, bending… I work with wood, so I’m always moving. It's hard to say exactly when it started, everything feels a bit… blurry. I apologize, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Noelani. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit blurry, we can work around that. A dull ache that feels heavy, and worse with activity… that gives us a starting point. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Oh… well, lying down sometimes helps. And… taking a warm bath. That feels nice. But it doesn’t take it away completely, you know? It just… eases it for a little while. I haven’t really tried anything else, to be honest. I wasn't sure what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and warm baths help temporarily. That's good to know. And you work with wood, so you're physically active… Have you noticed any swelling or any changes in the size or shape of your testicles?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. That’s a good question. I… I haven’t really looked closely, Doctor. I know that probably sounds silly, but I just… haven’t paid attention. I suppose… maybe a little bit bigger than usual? It’s hard to say for sure. Everything just feels… different, now that I’m thinking about it. It’s not dramatic, but… not quite right. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Noelani. Don't worry about feeling silly, it's better to tell me everything, even if it seems small. Okay, so potentially a little bit of swelling, along with the ache and heaviness. Have you had any fever, chills, or nausea recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach, thankfully. I've been feeling… tired, lately. But I thought that was just from working so much. And… well, getting older, I suppose. I am sorry if I’m not being very helpful, Doctor. It’s all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: No, you're being perfectly helpful, Noelani. It’s my job to piece things together, and you're giving me good information. Tiredness can be from a lot of things. Alright. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a simple check of your testicles and the surrounding area. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s fine, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. Please be gentle, if you don’t mind. And… perhaps you could explain what you’re doing as you go along? It would help me feel a little less… anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, just to rule out anything going on internally. Then, I'll gently palpate—that just means feel—your testicles to check for size, shape, and any tenderness. I’ll also be checking for any lumps or masses. I'll be feeling the areas around the testicles as well. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be too painful. Okay, I’m just going to have you lie down on your back for this.
PATIENT: Okay… You just let me know if anything feels… too much, alright? I’m a little worried, but I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now… everything sounds normal. Now, I'm gently feeling your testicles… Okay, I’m feeling a little tenderness on the left testicle. Not significant, but enough to note. The right testicle feels normal. Both testicles are generally the same size, but the left feels… slightly firmer than the right. No obvious masses or lumps that I can feel. There’s no swelling of the scrotum, either. Alright, Noelani. Everything seems relatively normal, but the slight tenderness and firmness on the left testicle warrants further investigation. It could be a number of things - inflammation, a minor injury you may not remember, or something else. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a scrotal ultrasound to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. What exactly will it show? And… will it hurt? I'm a little nervous, Doctor. I suppose I’m just worried about… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Noelani, and it's perfectly reasonable to be worried. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the structures inside your scrotum. It's completely painless – there’s no radiation involved, and it doesn't hurt at all. It's like getting a picture of your insides. It will show us the testicles themselves, the epididymis , and the surrounding tissues. It will help us see if there's any inflammation, a cyst, a small injury, or anything else causing the tenderness. It's a very safe and effective way to get a more detailed look. Based on what you’ve told me, and the slight tenderness I felt during the exam, it’s most likely something benign—not serious. But it’s always best to be thorough and rule out anything potentially concerning. I'll write you a referral for the ultrasound. It’s usually done at the imaging center across the street. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: Across the street, you say? That’s good. Not too far. And it doesn’t hurt… that’s a relief. What if… what if it is something serious, Doctor? I don’t have anyone to… to help me through this, if it’s bad news. I live alone. It’s just… a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Noelani, it's completely understandable that you're feeling frightened. It's okay to be scared, especially when you're facing something unknown. And it's brave of you to share that with me. Let’s take things one step at a time. We don't know anything for sure yet. The ultrasound will give us more information, and then we can discuss the results and figure out the best course of action. If it is something that needs further attention, there are many effective treatments available. And you absolutely wouldn’t have to go through it alone. I would be here to support you every step of the way. I can provide referrals to specialists, connect you with support groups, and help you understand all your options. And I understand you live alone, that’s okay. We’ll make sure you have all the support you need. We can discuss resources for help with transportation, and if any procedure is necessary, we can arrange for someone to be with you. Let's focus on getting the ultrasound done first. That will give us the answers we need. And remember, I'm here for you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that does help, a little. It's just… it's been a long time since I had anyone to… to lean on. The referral… will it have all the information about where to go, and what to do? And… how long does the ultrasound usually take? I have to arrange for someone to watch my shop that day, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. The referral will have all the information you need – the address of the imaging center, the phone number to schedule the appointment, and any specific instructions they may have. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes, maybe a little longer, depending on the technician. We can put a note on the referral requesting a specific time, if that helps with arranging coverage for your shop. Here you are. I've also included a list of resources for support groups in the area, just in case you're interested. And my office number is on the referral as well, so please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, at any time. Before you go, are there any other concerns you’d like to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you… thank you so much for your patience and kindness. I feel… a little less anxious, now. Knowing I’m not alone, and that you’ll be there to help… that means a lot. I’ll schedule the ultrasound as soon as I can. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please do call if you have any questions or concerns, and don’t hesitate to reach out after the ultrasound. I’ll be here to discuss the results with you. Take care of yourself, and please don’t worry too much. We’ll figure things out together. .
