DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. This… heartburn, I guess you’d call it, is getting ridiculous. Food just comes back up. It's not pleasant, believe me. And it's been happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing frequent heartburn and regurgitation. It's good you're getting it checked out. When did this start happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my stomach problems. Maybe… six months ago? Something like that. It started gradually, just a little bit after eating sometimes, and now it’s… well, you heard me. It's not improving, that's for sure. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to talk about when it started all day?
DOCTOR: No, no, we're getting there. I apologize if I seemed to be focusing too much on the timeline. Six months is helpful. And it's progressively worsening, you said. Can you describe the food that comes up?
PATIENT: Look, it's just… food. What do you want me to say? Whatever I ate, usually. Sometimes it's liquid, sometimes it's… chunks. It’s not a science project, Doctor. I don’t analyze it. It tastes… bad. Like it's been… sitting. Is this really necessary? Do you need a detailed menu of everything I’ve eaten for the past six months?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, you don’t need to provide a detailed menu. “Tastes bad, like it’s been sitting” is helpful. And it happens after most meals, or are there specific foods that trigger it more often?
PATIENT: Honestly? It seems to happen no matter what I eat. I try to be careful, you know? I don't go loading up on spicy things, but even something plain like… chicken and rice can bring it on. It's very frustrating. I'm a careful eater. This isn’t about my diet. Something is just wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not consistently linked to specific foods, despite your efforts to avoid triggers. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the heartburn and regurgitation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, sometimes my chest feels a little… tight. Not like a heart attack, mind you. But uncomfortable. And I do burp. A lot. My wife complains constantly. But other than that… no, not really. It’s just the food coming back up, and this tightness, and the burping. It's enough, believe me. Is this getting us closer to a solution, or are we just collecting symptoms now?
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness and frequent burping along with the heartburn and regurgitation. Good to know. The chest tightness is important, and we’ll definitely want to explore that further. Now, have you ever tried any medications for this, either over-the-counter or prescribed by another doctor?
PATIENT: Look, I tried one of those antacids. The pink ones. Didn’t do a thing. My primary care doctor… well, he just told me to watch what I eat and maybe lose a few pounds. As if that's helpful. I'm a big guy, okay? It’s genetics. And it didn't fix the problem. So no, I haven't had much luck with anything. I just figured I'd come to someone who actually knows what they’re doing. Are we going to get a diagnosis soon? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds like you've tried some things already without much relief, and I apologize for the delay in getting to a diagnosis. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some potential causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don’t take all day. And please, no poking and prodding. I’m not a fan. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in the upper part of your stomach, right under your breastbone. No masses or guarding.
PATIENT: Tenderness? Well, no wonder it's tender, I'm throwing up in there! Is that all you got? Tenderness? I could have told you that without the poking. This is… not very helpful, Doctor. Are we getting closer to figuring out why this is happening? Or just documenting the obvious?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. You’re right, the tenderness is expected given your symptoms, and I apologize for stating the obvious. However, it’s important for documentation and to rule out other potential causes. Based on your history and the physical exam, it's likely you’re experiencing symptoms of GERD – Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease – which is when stomach acid frequently flows back into your esophagus. The regurgitation, heartburn, and chest tightness are all common symptoms. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have an upper endoscopy, and a pH monitoring study?
PATIENT: Endo… what? And a pH… study? Look, I don't even know what those are, and frankly, I don't want to find out. Are we talking about sticking things down my throat? Because if so, no. Absolutely not. I came here for help, not to be a science experiment. Can't you just… give me something to stop it? Pills? Something? I don't need tests. I need a solution. And I need it now. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera down your esophagus to visualize the lining and check for any inflammation or damage. A pH monitoring study measures the amount of acid in your esophagus over a 24-hour period. They’re the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and rule out more serious conditions like Barrett’s esophagus. However, I respect your wishes. We can start with medication. I can prescribe a Proton Pump Inhibitor – a PPI – which reduces stomach acid production. We’ll start with a low dose and see if that provides relief. But, it’s important to understand that without a diagnosis, we’re essentially treating symptoms without knowing the underlying cause. If the PPI doesn’t work, or your symptoms worsen, we'll need to revisit the idea of further testing. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Pills. Whatever. Just get me something that works. I'll try your pills. But if they don't work, I'm not coming back. And I’m not letting anyone stick anything down my throat. Understand? Just… write the prescription. I have things to do. Is that finally it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, that is it for today. I’m prescribing Omeprazole, 20mg, once daily, for two weeks. Take it 30 minutes before a meal. If your symptoms improve significantly after two weeks, continue taking the medication as directed. If they don't, or if you experience any new symptoms – especially difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, or blood in your stool – please contact my office immediately. I'll also provide you with a handout detailing the side effects of Omeprazole and lifestyle modifications that can help manage GERD – things like elevating the head of your bed, avoiding trigger foods, and not eating late at night. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… the pills. Thank you. I hope they work. I really do. And please, send a nurse to help me find the exit. I’m not good with directions. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Altine. I’ll have a nurse escort you to the exit. I truly hope the medication brings you relief. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
