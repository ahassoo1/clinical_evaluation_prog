DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it’s nice to meet you as well. I’ve been feeling rather… off, lately. Mostly just excessively thirsty and hungry, even after I’ve eaten. It’s a bit disruptive, to be honest. I’d like to get to the bottom of it if possible, and quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Christen. Disruptive symptoms are definitely worth looking into. Excessive thirst and hunger can have a number of causes, so let's try to narrow things down. First, how long have you been experiencing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… about three or four weeks now, I’d say. It started gradually, just noticing I was refilling my water glass more often, and then… needing a snack a bit sooner after meals. It’s definitely gotten worse over the last week, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four weeks, gradually worsening. And would you say this increased appetite is for any particular type of food, or just… everything in general?
PATIENT: Not really particular, no. It’s… frustratingly, everything. Sweet things, savoury things, doesn’t matter. If it’s food, I seem to want it. And it doesn't feel like normal hunger, if that makes sense. It’s more… a constant craving.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Christen. A constant craving is different from regular hunger. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, even after a full night’s sleep. And I seem to be going to the bathroom… more often than usual, if you catch my drift. I hadn't really connected it before, but… yes. Tiredness and needing the loo more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness and increased urination as well. That’s helpful. And when you say “more often,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… well, normally I’d go maybe twice during the day. Now it’s… closer to four or five, easily. And sometimes even during the night, which is unusual for me. I’m not in pain or anything, just… frequent. It’s a bit of a nuisance, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Christen. Four or five times a day, and some nighttime trips, where you normally don’t go. That’s definitely something we need to investigate. Now, let's move onto some other things. Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother’s side, yes. My grandmother had it, I believe. Type 2, I think. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had something with his kidneys, but I don’t know the specifics. Otherwise, no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve generally been quite healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of Type 2 diabetes and kidney issues on both sides. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications currently, thankfully. And no allergies, as far as I know. I had a reaction to penicillin as a child, but that was… a long time ago. I haven’t had any problems with anything else. I’m quite careful with what I take, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No current medications and no known allergies besides a childhood penicillin reaction. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… right. I work in shipping and receiving, so it's a fair bit of walking and lifting during the day. Not terribly strenuous, but I'm on my feet a lot. I… divorced a couple of years ago, so it's mostly just me now. I don't drink a great deal, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, and I don't smoke. I try to eat reasonably well, though with this constant hunger, it's been harder lately. I don't do a lot of exercise, I admit. It's not my strong suit.
DOCTOR: Okay, shipping and receiving, so you're active during the workday. Divorced a couple of years ago, occasional glass of wine, non-smoker, and trying to eat well, but it’s been difficult with the increased appetite. Alright, Christen, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Then, I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly sensible, Doctor. The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better. I’m happy to go ahead with the exam and the tests. Honestly, I’d be grateful if you could just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Christen. Let's get started then. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes and some basic neurological functions. Everything seems to be functioning normally there as well. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a hemoglobin A1c, and a urinalysis. The A1c will help us look at your average blood sugar levels over the past few months, and the other tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health. We'll get those results back within a few days. In the meantime, I want you to try and maintain your usual diet as much as possible. Please let the receptionist know you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Twelve hours fasting… right. Yes, I can manage that. And no, not at the moment, Doctor. Just… when can I expect to hear back? And is there anything… anything particularly worrying you? I’m not trying to be difficult, just… I’m a bit anxious, if you don’t mind me saying so. This whole thing is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Christen. It’s perfectly natural to be unsettled when you’re experiencing new symptoms. The lab usually gets the results back to us within 48 to 72 hours. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as we have them. To answer your question about what’s worrying me, your symptoms – increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, and fatigue – are all consistent with diabetes. However, it’s important to remember that there are other possible causes as well. That's why we need the blood work to get a definitive answer. Don’t jump to conclusions just yet. We're going to get this figured out. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms, like blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, or slow-healing sores, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Blurred vision or weight loss… alright, I'll keep an eye out for that. No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate it. I’ll make sure to fast before the blood work and I’ll wait for the nurse to call. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work, other than the fasting? Like, should I avoid strenuous exercise beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. I’m glad I could reassure you. And you're right to ask about preparation. Besides the 12-hour fast, I recommend avoiding any strenuous exercise the day before and the morning of the blood work. It can sometimes affect the results. Just take it easy. Also, please drink plenty of water the day before to stay hydrated. That will make the blood draw easier. Do you have any other questions at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I’ll see you when the results are back, I suppose. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and I'll talk to you soon.
