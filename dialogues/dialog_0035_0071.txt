DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. My name is Karry Skarbek, and… well, it's about getting some shots. My daughter, she’s trying to get her husband to come to this country, and I understand there are some things he needs to have done before he can get a visa. I’m trying to help her figure out what those are. It’s a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Skarbek, I understand. You're looking into required vaccinations for your son-in-law’s visa application. That can be confusing, there are specific requirements. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any documentation outlining which vaccinations they’re requesting?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I don’t. My daughter gave me the idea that I should come talk to a doctor to find out what he needs. She just said something about needing proof of shots, and I figured it was best to get it sorted out properly. I’m not very good with paperwork, and honestly, I don’t even know where to begin looking for that information. She mentioned something about a form, maybe? But I haven’t seen it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. We can definitely figure this out. It sounds like you’re being proactive, which is good. To start, do you know where your son-in-law is coming from?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. He’s coming from… let me think… Honduras. That's right, Honduras. It's a bit of a journey for him, and my daughter is real eager to have him here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Honduras. That helps narrow things down. The requirements depend on the country of origin. Generally, for someone coming from Honduras, we'll want to ensure he's up-to-date on routine vaccinations like tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis – that’s the Tdap shot – measles, mumps, rubella, varicella – chickenpox – and influenza. Depending on his age, we may also consider pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines. Have you, yourself, had those vaccinations recently, or do you recall having them in the past?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a lot of names! I… I don’t really remember all that. I had shots as a child, of course, but that was a long time ago. I mostly just get a flu shot every year, you know, to stay healthy. I don't recall anything specific about… tetanus and diphtheria and… all those others. Would there be a way to find out what I’ve had before? Maybe some records somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly try to locate your vaccination records. Sometimes they are available through your primary care physician if you’ve consistently seen the same doctor. We can also check with the state health department. It might take a little time to track them down. In the meantime, to be safe, and since you aren't certain of his vaccination history, we can start with a basic panel of blood tests to check for immunity to some of those diseases. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… well, I don’t love needles, but if it helps get this sorted out for my daughter, then yes, that sounds alright. I just… I get a little lightheaded sometimes, so if we do that, maybe I should sit down? And perhaps have something to drink afterward? I'm happy to do whatever is best, I just want to make sure everything is done properly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it slow and make sure you're comfortable. We have a comfortable chair right here, and I’ll have the nurse bring you some juice and a snack after the blood draw. She’s very good at drawing blood and will be gentle. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to latex, band-aids, or any medications?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I don’t think so. No allergies that I know of, anyway. I’ve never had any trouble with bandages or anything like that. I used to help my grandmother with her garden, and I got a few scratches and scrapes, but nothing serious. Never had a reaction to anything like that, or any medicines, either. I try to stay away from medicines if I can, but sometimes you just have to take something, you know? But I've never had a bad reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. That simplifies things. Alright, let's get the orders entered for the blood tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. She’ll explain the process and answer any questions you have. While we wait, do you have a current list of any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for a headache, but that’s not very often. Other than that, nothing. I try to eat healthy and get plenty of rest, so I don’t really need much in the way of supplements or anything. I like a little bit of chamomile tea at night to help me sleep, but that’s not a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea doesn’t count as a medication. Just the Lisinopril for blood pressure then. And occasional Tylenol. Good. Okay, I've documented that in your chart. The nurse should be in within a few minutes. She'll get you all set up for the blood draw, and then we’ll have the results back in a few days. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to help me with this. It’s a big relief to finally get started. I just hope we can get this all sorted out quickly so my daughter’s husband can come home. He’s a good man, and she misses him very much. I'm just… a little nervous about the needles, that’s all. But I trust you and the nurse will take good care of me. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. We’ll do everything we can to make this as smooth as possible. And don’t worry about the needles, we’ll take it slow. Just let the nurse know if you’re feeling anxious, and she can help.
