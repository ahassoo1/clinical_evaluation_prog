DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’d like to learn more about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a little… hectic sometimes, even though my job isn’t that stressful. I just want to find ways to feel a bit calmer, you know?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… well, from what I understand, it’s about focusing on the present moment, being aware of your thoughts and feelings without judging them. I think. There are apps, and classes, and… I’m not really sure where to start, or if it’s even something that would help me, to be honest. I thought maybe you could tell me if it’s a good idea, or if there’s something else I should be looking into. It’s just… I want to be less reactive, I suppose. Less… flustered.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you are consulting a physician. While I appreciate you seeking my opinion on…lifestyle choices, my expertise lies in medical conditions. Are you experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression that are prompting you to explore these techniques?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, goodness, you're right. I’m so sorry. I just… I thought maybe you’d have some knowledge of it generally. No, no medical conditions, not at all. Just… feeling a bit overwhelmed sometimes, and wanting to be proactive about it. I get a little anxious about getting anxious, if that makes sense? Like, worrying about worrying. But it’s not… debilitating, not even close. I just want to learn some tools, maybe? I feel silly even bringing it up now. I should have clarified. Medicare doesn't usually cover things like… preventative calm, I imagine.
DOCTOR: It is commendable that you are taking an interest in your wellbeing. However, utilizing a physician’s time for matters that do not involve a diagnosable medical condition is… inefficient. Perhaps a therapist or counselor would be a more appropriate resource for you. I can provide you with a list of referrals if you wish, though I must caution you that Medicare coverage will depend on your specific plan and the nature of the services provided. Do you have any other medical concerns you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, of course. I understand. I didn't mean to take up your time unnecessarily. A therapist… yes, that probably makes more sense. A list would be wonderful, if you don’t mind. And no, no other medical concerns today, thank you. Just… the calm thing. I’ll try not to bother you with it again.
DOCTOR: Here you are. These are therapists in the area who accept Medicare. I would advise you to contact them directly to inquire about their specialties and availability. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate it. No, I think that’s all. Really, thank you for your time. And again, sorry for… the calm thing. I should probably let you get back to patients who actually need to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Sugino. And do consider prioritizing addressing any genuine medical concerns should they arise.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
