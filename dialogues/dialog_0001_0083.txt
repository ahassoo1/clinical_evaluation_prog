DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, good to see you... I guess. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Good to see you too. I need... a little something from you. A card, you understand? A "Get Well" card. My niece, she thinks it would cheer me up. She worries too much, that one. But a card from a doctor... that would mean something.
DOCTOR: A…card?
PATIENT: Yes. A card. You write on it, you know? “Feel better soon.” Something like that. It's for my spirits, Doctor. I'm a… a man who appreciates these things. Not asking for pills or anything. Just… a little encouragement in writing. Is this a problem?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kammer, I’m a physician. I treat illnesses, I don't… provide emotional support via stationery. This isn’t really what I do. Are you experiencing any actual medical problems?
PATIENT: Well, now see here. I am a patient, aren't I? And a patient can request things from their doctor. I keep myself in good working order, I do. Stationary Engineer, you know? Boilers don't fix themselves. But a little… consideration wouldn’t hurt. It's not like I'm asking for a whole operation. Just a few words. Are you saying you can't write a simple card? It makes me question your bedside manner, frankly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I have other patients waiting. I can document your request in your chart, noting your desire for a… motivational note. But I am not going to spend valuable time drafting a "Get Well" card. Do you have any legitimate health concerns we should address?
PATIENT: Legitimate? Now you're questioning my legitimacy? I told you, I keep myself in good shape! I just… a man gets low sometimes, you know? Gets to thinking. And a card would help. You make it sound like it's… foolish. It's not about being sick, it's about staying that way. A little kindness, Doctor. That’s all I’m asking. Is that too much to ask of a professional?
DOCTOR: Alright, look. I'm accessing your EHR now. Let's see… height 187, weight 64. That's… quite low for your height. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Finally. Someone is paying attention. Yes, Doctor, a little weight loss. Maybe five pounds. Not much! But I noticed. It's the heat, you know? Doesn’t have much appetite when it’s this humid. But it's not a problem. Just… a fact. Now, about the card? Will you at least consider it after we talk about this… weight? It shows you care.
DOCTOR: Five pounds is significant given your BMI. Do you have any changes in your appetite, any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea?
PATIENT: Now you're starting to sound like my niece. Always asking questions. No nausea, no… vomiting, Doctor. And no diarrhea! I eat regular, mostly. A little less when it’s hot, but I maintain. Look, I’m a practical man. I deal with pressure vessels all day. I know what's normal and what's not. I don’t need a lecture about my… digestive system. Can we please get back to the card? It would mean a lot to my niece, and, frankly, to me. It's a small thing, Doctor. A very small thing.
DOCTOR: Your last recorded physical exam was… three years ago. And it notes a history of mild hypertension, though currently unmanaged. Are you currently taking any medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hypertension? That was years ago! A little stress, you know? The boilers, they don't run themselves! But I watch my salt, I do. No medication. I prefer to manage things… naturally. Look, Doctor, are we here to discuss my entire medical history or are we going to address my simple request? This is getting ridiculous. A card. That's all I want. Are you refusing to provide one?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I'm concerned about your weight loss, your unmanaged hypertension, and the fact that you haven't had a physical exam in three years. Frankly, focusing on a "Get Well" card at this moment is… irresponsible. I recommend we schedule a full workup, including blood tests and a cardiovascular evaluation. Before we do anything else. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Now you're just trying to sell me things I don't need. Blood tests, cardiovascular evaluations… I'm a perfectly functional man! I operate heavy machinery for a living! I told you, the heat! A little less appetite. It's not a crisis. Look, Doctor, I came here for a simple kindness. A card. Now you're making me feel like I'm falling apart. Fine. Schedule your tests. But you're still writing the card. After the tests. As a… a gesture of goodwill. It’s the least you can do. And if you don't write the card, I'll be finding a new doctor. One who understands patient needs.
DOCTOR: Fine. I'll schedule the workup. And I will… document your request for a motivational note. But I'm not making any promises. Now, let’s get started with your ROS. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations recently?
