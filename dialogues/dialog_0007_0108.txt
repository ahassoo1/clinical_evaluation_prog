DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwin’ up blood, mostly. Not a ton, but enough to worry a fella. Happened a couple times now, over the last few days. It’s… well, it’s blood, Doc. Hard to miss. Don't really know what's causing it, to be honest. Never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Throwing up blood is definitely something we need to figure out. It’s good you came in to get it checked. When you say “a couple of times,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Let me think… the first time was… Tuesday, I believe. Early morning. Then again Friday night. And… yeah, just this morning, too. Not huge amounts, like I said. More like… streaks in it. Dark red. Not… chunky. If that makes a difference. I don’t eat anything weird, I promise. Just regular food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday, Friday, and this morning – that's helpful. And dark red streaks, not a large volume… alright. No chunks or anything like that, good to know. You mentioned “mostly regular food.” Can you tell me a little more about your diet?
PATIENT: Look, I eat. You know? Meat, rice, bread… typical stuff. I like lamb, a lot of it. And dates. I eat a lot of dates. Not a fancy eater, Doc. Never been one for salads or anything green. And I do have coffee, maybe four or five cups a day. Black. Helps me stay awake, you know? This job… it’s not exactly a picnic. Dealing with… things all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, lamb, dates, coffee – four to five cups a day, black. That’s good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the vomiting?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. I've been kinda tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And my stomach… it’s been achin’ a bit, on and off. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And… well, I haven't been… regular, if you catch my drift. Haven’t gone to the bathroom properly in a few days. Sorry to be so blunt.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Brad. It’s important to give me a complete picture. Tiredness, stomach ache, and constipation… alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Haven't felt warm or anything. Chills, no. And weight loss… well, I haven't been trying to lose weight. Haven’t really noticed a difference, to be honest. I’m a skinny guy, always have been. Still am. Don't exactly have much to lose, if you know what I mean. This job doesn't exactly encourage a big appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or noticeable weight loss. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Look, not really. I had the usual kid stuff, chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. Never been to the hospital for anything major. I got a bad knee a few years back, from work, but that's it. Just aches. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she always told me to watch my blood pressure. But I never really bothered with it. Didn't see the point, frankly. She passed away three years ago, now. So… haven’t been to a doctor much since then.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Brad. It’s understandable that you haven’t been prioritizing your health since then. No major medical conditions or hospitalizations besides the knee… alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. I avoid hospitals when I can. Don't trust 'em, to be honest. Always felt like they just want to poke and prod and find something wrong. My wife… she was the one who went to the doctors. I just handled the… other stuff. Kept things running. Still do, I guess. Even without her. It’s… a long story. Not a fan of needles, either, if that matters. Never been good with pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And you're not a fan of hospitals or needles, I understand. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family - are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My side… not really. My dad was strong as an ox, lived to be eighty. My mother, she had… arthritis, I think. Bad hips. But nothing serious, like heart trouble or cancer. My wife’s side… she had a lot of sisters. One of ‘em had diabetes, I think. But that's about it. Mostly just… old age stuff. They weren’t exactly a healthy bunch, to be honest. They ate a lot of sweets. Probably why she worried about my blood sugar. Though I always thought she was just fussin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis on your side, diabetes in your wife’s family… alright. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. Alcohol… I used to have a beer now and then, with my wife. Socially, you know? But not anymore. Haven’t had a drink since… well, since she passed. Didn't feel right. Still doesn't. Mostly just… drink water. Lots of it. Keeps me going. This job’s thirsty work, as I said. Not much else to my life these days, honestly. Just work and… remembering.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol in the past, but none currently. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been much for pills. Always figured I could handle things myself. And, well, I haven't really needed any. Until now, apparently. Throwin' up blood is a bit more than I can handle on my own. It's not exactly a headache you can just sleep off, you know? Honestly, Doc, I'm a bit worried. This feels… different. I usually just tough things out.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Brad. It's good you came in. Okay, so no medications currently, no allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. Can eat anything. Bees, peanuts, shellfish… never had a problem. I even handle… things all day, you know? Chemicals, smells… I'm pretty tough, Doc. Usually. But this blood thing… it’s different. It feels… internal. Like something’s really wrong. I usually don’t bother doctors for much, but this… this is scaring me a bit, honestly. It's like my body’s giving out, and I don't know why. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. No allergies, no medications, and you're usually quite resilient. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your vital signs. It will only take a few minutes. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? This job... it's not easy on a fella’s nerves. I’ll lie down. Just… be gentle. And try not to take too long. I got things to get back to, unfortunately. Though, I guess throwing up blood takes priority. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Like something’s fallin’ apart. Alright, here I go. shifts onto the examination table awkwardly Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Your heart rate is a little elevated, around 95 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 140/90. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, but nothing significant. No masses or guarding. Your spleen and liver feel normal in size. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Mild tenderness, huh? That's… about right. I do get a bit of a ache there sometimes. Nothing major, just a dull discomfort. Like somethin’s… full. Maybe it’s the dates. I eat a lot of ‘em. Doc, is this somethin’ serious? You’re makin’ me nervous here. My heart’s racin’ just thinkin’ about it. And you say my blood pressure’s high? I didn't even know those numbers meant anything. I just… I gotta get back to work, you know? People depend on me. This job… it’s important. But I’m worryin’ now. Is it somethin’ I need to be really scared about? Honestly, Doc, just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll be as straightforward as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen is something we need to investigate further. Throwing up blood, even in small amounts, is always a cause for concern, and coupled with the tenderness and elevated blood pressure, it points towards a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like a stomach ulcer or esophagitis, but it could also be something more serious, like a bleeding problem in the upper gastrointestinal tract. To get a clearer picture, I want to order some blood tests to check your hemoglobin levels and kidney function, and I also recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The endoscopy will allow us to identify the source of the bleeding and take a biopsy if needed. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… an endoscopy? You’re talkin’ a lot of fancy words, Doc. Hemoglobin, duodenum… I don't understand half of it. An endoscopy sounds… invasive. Like stickin’ a camera down my throat? I don't like the sound of that at all. And you said “biopsy”? Is that… cuttin’ pieces out of me? Look, I told you, I don't do well with hospitals or doctors pokin’ around. Can’t we just give me some pills? Or something? I got work to do, Doc. People are dependin’ on me. This sounds… serious. Is this gonna take long? And is it… painful? Honestly, you’re scaring me to death here. Is it somethin’ really bad? Just tell me straight. No fancy words. Just… bad or not bad? I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Let’s break it down. You’re right to be concerned, and I apologize if I used too much medical jargon. I’ll be as straightforward as possible. The blood tests will help us see if you’ve lost a lot of blood and how well your kidneys are functioning. The endoscopy does involve inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera down your throat, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We can give you a sedative to make you comfortable during the procedure. A biopsy simply means taking a small tissue sample to examine under a microscope. It’s usually painless. Right now, I can't tell you definitively if it's “bad or not bad” because we need more information. That’s why the tests are important. However, throwing up blood is something we need to take seriously. It could be something relatively minor, but it could also be something more serious, like a bleeding ulcer or, less commonly, something more concerning. The endoscopy will give us a much clearer picture. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. Given your history and current symptoms, I'm concerned enough to recommend this workup. Would you be willing to schedule the endoscopy?
PATIENT: Thirty to sixty minutes... and a camera down my throat... and you said "sedative"? Like I'll be out of it? Honestly, Doc, this is… a lot. I don't like any of this. I really don't. And who’s gonna do my work? People depend on me. I can’t just disappear for a day. Look, I appreciate you tellin' me straight, but I just… I don't know. Can't we try somethin' else first? Some pills to stop the bleedin'? Something less… invasive? I'm a practical man, Doc. I deal with… hard things. But this… this is different. I’m worried about bein’ out of it, and I’m worried about my work. And honestly, I’m worried about what you’ll find. What are the chances it's somethin’ really bad? Just give me a percentage. A ballpark. Just tell me how screwed I am. Straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand your hesitation and your concerns. It's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about this. Let me address your questions directly. Unfortunately, pills alone are unlikely to be effective in stopping the bleeding without knowing the source. We need to visualize your upper gastrointestinal tract to identify the cause and treat it appropriately. As for the sedative, it’s a mild sedative designed to make you comfortable and relaxed during the procedure. You won’t be completely “out,” but you likely won’t remember much of it. Now, regarding your question about the chances of it being “something really bad,” it’s difficult to give you a precise percentage without the endoscopy. The majority of cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are caused by relatively benign conditions like ulcers or esophagitis, which are treatable. However, there's a smaller chance – around 10-15% – that it could be something more serious, like a bleeding tumor or a vascular abnormality. I understand your work is important, and we can certainly discuss options for arranging coverage while you're undergoing the procedure. I also want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable and minimize any discomfort. I strongly recommend scheduling the endoscopy to get a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. But ultimately, the decision is yours. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ten to fifteen percent... that's… unsettling. A bleeding tumor… I don’t even want to think about that. Look, Doc, you’re right. I need to know. I can’t just keep throwin’ up blood and pretendin’ it’s not happenin’. And I guess… I guess I gotta face it eventually. Alright. Fine. Schedule the endoscopy. But… I want it done as soon as possible. And… and I want the best doctor doin’ it. Someone experienced. And I want to be as comfortable as possible. And… and I need to know exactly what’s gonna happen. Every single step. And… and I’m gonna need a ride home. I don’t trust myself drivin’ after bein’ sedated. And… can we talk about my work? Maybe there’s someone who can cover for me? I can’t just leave things hangin’. Alright. Schedule it. Get it over with. But… be gentle, Doc. Be gentle. shifts uncomfortably on the examination table Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. You’re making the right decision, and I commend you for facing this head-on. I’ll schedule the endoscopy for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM with Dr. Ramirez, one of our most experienced gastroenterologists. He's excellent, very compassionate, and will explain everything to you in detail. We’ll provide you with a detailed consent form outlining the procedure, risks, and benefits. You’ll also receive instructions on preparing for the endoscopy, including fasting guidelines. We'll absolutely ensure you are as comfortable as possible. Dr. Ramirez will discuss the sedation options with you, and we’ll have a nurse monitor you closely throughout the procedure. We'll arrange for a ride home for you as well. Regarding your work, let me see if I can connect you with a social worker who can assist you with finding temporary coverage. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this process as smooth and stress-free as possible. Now, let me get the scheduling process started. Do you have any questions for me before I proceed?
PATIENT: A social worker? That… that might actually help. I hadn't even thought about that. Alright. That would be good. Really good. No. I think… I think that's all for now. Just… get it scheduled. And make sure it’s Dr. Ramirez. And… and make sure he’s gentle. And… and can I get a glass of water? My mouth’s kinda dry. And… just… thanks, Doc. For listenin’. I appreciate it. I really do. It's just… a lot to take in. leans back and closes his eyes, looking visibly relieved and anxious at the same time Just get it over with. That’s all I ask. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brad. I’ll get everything arranged for you right away. I'll also get a nurse to bring you a glass of water. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and you're not alone in feeling anxious. We'll take care of you. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly with the water, and I’ll be right back to confirm the appointment details with you. In the meantime, just try to relax. You've taken the first step, and we'll handle everything from here.
