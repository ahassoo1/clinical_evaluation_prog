DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s Velda Squiers, yes. I’m planning a cruise, you see, and the cruise line requires some… medical information. Just a bit of paperwork they need before I set sail, really. I was hoping you could help me with that.
DOCTOR: A pre-cruise physical, is it?
PATIENT: Not a physical, exactly. They didn’t ask for a full examination. More just… a note stating what, if any, conditions I have, and what medications I take. They sent a form, a very official-looking form, and it mentioned needing a doctor’s signature. Do you understand? It’s a bit confusing, all the legal wording.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Cruise lines are becoming…particular. Let’s get this form filled out then. To do that properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, Ms. Squiers. It’s standard procedure. We'll start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – over the course of your life?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, years ago, when I was quite a bit younger, I had a touch of bronchitis, but that cleared up completely. And I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with a small dose of medication. Nothing major, truly. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Is that what you mean by ‘condition’? It was a bit of a bother, but I recovered well.
DOCTOR: Bronchitis, history of high blood pressure currently controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. Thank you. And is your blood pressure currently well-controlled, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I take a small tablet every morning, and my doctor—my previous doctor, I should say—said it was fine. He checked it regularly. It's usually around… well, I don’t recall the exact number, but he was always satisfied. I haven’t had any problems with it for years. It's not something I worry about.
DOCTOR: "Satisfied" is not a medical reading, Ms. Squiers. Do you have any records of your blood pressure readings, perhaps from your previous doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t, I’m afraid. I never thought to ask for them. He always just… told me it was good. I just trusted him. He’s retired now, you see. Moved to Spain, apparently. I suppose I should have been more proactive, but I wasn’t feeling unwell, so I didn’t. It was a small practice, and he was very… reassuring. Would you like me to try and remember the numbers? I might be able to recall something approximate.
DOCTOR: Approximate numbers are not particularly useful, Ms. Squiers. Let’s move on. Do you take any medications currently, besides the tablet for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one, then. A small white tablet. I take it every morning with my breakfast. It's called… let me think… Amlodipine, I believe. Yes, Amlodipine. Five milligrams. That’s what the label says. I’ve been taking it for… oh, at least ten years now, perhaps longer. It’s quite routine.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I eat most things, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I’ve had a few insect bites over the years, as you might expect living in Scotland, but nothing serious. A bit of swelling, perhaps, but nothing more than a nuisance. I’m quite fortunate, really. I don’t seem to suffer much from allergies.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, thinking about your family... is there a history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer – that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a difficult one. My mother… she had a touch of arthritis, but that's not terribly significant, is it? My father… he lived a long life, but I believe he had some problems with his heart in his later years. Nothing diagnosed, as far as I know. He just… slowed down. And my brother… he’s quite healthy, thankfully. A bit overweight, perhaps, but otherwise well. There wasn't much talk of serious illness in our family, to be honest. We weren't one for dwelling on such things.
DOCTOR: History of arthritis in mother, possible heart problems in father. And now, Ms. Squiers, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that sounds rather… personal. What do you mean by ‘social history’, exactly? Is it about my hobbies? Or… my living arrangements? I live alone, you see. I was married, but my husband passed away some years ago now. I’ve been quite independent since then. Is that what you’re interested in?
DOCTOR: I require information regarding your lifestyle, Ms. Squiers. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never. I’ve always considered smoking terribly unhealthy. And my late husband didn't either. He was very particular about his health. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I do enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally, but that’s hardly excessive, is it? A small glass, and only with food.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, occasional social drinker. And do you exercise regularly, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Regularly? Not as much as I should, perhaps. I enjoy a walk, when the weather permits. But Scotland isn't always known for its sunshine, you see. And I’m not one for gyms or strenuous activity. A gentle stroll is more my pace. I used to do a bit of gardening, but my back isn’t what it used to be. It's a bit of a bother these days. I try to keep active, but it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, for a quick physical assessment, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline reading. It won’t take long. Could you step up onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No trouble at all. There you are. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, to be honest. I used to worry about it more, but… well, it is what it is, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: 109 pounds. And your height is noted as 171 centimeters. Now, let’s take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Just relax your arm, Ms. Squiers.
PATIENT: Alright. I am quite relaxed, thank you. Although, I do sometimes find doctor's offices a bit… unsettling. It’s not the room, necessarily, but the thought of what you might find. Still, I am trying to be calm. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, quite alright. Your blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A bit elevated, Ms. Squiers. I'll need to document that. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: There you are. Although, I did have a rather large cup of tea earlier. Perhaps that’s affecting it? I do enjoy a good cup of tea. It’s a Scottish tradition, you see. Is that what you’re hearing? The tea?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Squiers, I am assessing your cardiovascular function. I detect a slightly rapid rate, but no murmurs or abnormal lung sounds. Now, I'll just check your reflexes briefly.
PATIENT: Alright. That feels… a bit strange. I haven't had my reflexes checked in years. I used to think it was only something they did in films. It's all very thorough, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Alright, Ms. Squiers. Based on your history and this brief assessment, your blood pressure is elevated, which requires monitoring, but overall, you appear to be in stable condition. Do you have any questions for me before I complete this form?
PATIENT: Well… that’s reassuring to hear. No, I don’t think I do. Just… about the blood pressure. Should I be worried? Is it something I need to address immediately? Or just keep an eye on it? I do try to manage my health, you see. I just don’t want anything to spoil my cruise. It’s been planned for months, and I am terribly excited. Would a smaller cup of tea help, do you think?
DOCTOR: A smaller cup of tea might have a negligible effect, Ms. Squiers. But your blood pressure is consistently elevated, and requires more than just reducing caffeine intake. I recommend you schedule an appointment with a physician for ongoing monitoring and potential medication adjustment. We can arrange that here, or I can provide a referral. As for the cruise, I do not advise travel until your blood pressure is stabilized. I will complete this form stating your history of hypertension and recommending medical follow-up. Is there an emergency contact I can include?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… rather disappointing. I hadn’t anticipated such a concern. I suppose that’s what you’re paid for, though, isn’t it? To uncover such things. Alright. No, I don’t really have an emergency contact. My husband… well, he’s passed away, as I mentioned. And I don’t have any close family. I manage perfectly well on my own, truly. Perhaps just my name and phone number then? I can always contact the cruise line if they require further information. And you said ‘stabilized’… how long do you think that might take? A week? A month? It’s the timing, you see. The cruise departs in two weeks.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the completed form. It details your medical history, including the hypertension, and strongly recommends medical follow-up. As for stabilization, it's impossible to say definitively without further assessment and monitoring. Two weeks is a very short timeframe, and I cannot medically clear you for travel without a demonstrated improvement in your blood pressure control. I strongly advise postponing your cruise until you have consulted with a physician and achieved stable readings. I can provide a list of physicians in the area, should you wish. Prioritizing your health is paramount, Ms. Squiers. A cruise is not worth jeopardizing your well-being. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. Perfectly. It's just… terribly frustrating. It's been planned for so long, and all the arrangements have been made. But you are right, of course. My health is more important. Alright. Yes, a list of physicians would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, if a bit… alarming. I suppose I should contact the cruise line and explain the situation. And then schedule an appointment. It’s all rather a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Very well. My receptionist will provide you with the list of physicians before you leave. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions. .
