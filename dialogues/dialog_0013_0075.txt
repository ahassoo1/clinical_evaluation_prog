DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here because… honestly, I’ve been feeling awfully tired during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. It just doesn’t seem to be helping as much as I thought it would.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness even with the CPAP machine – that's good information to start with. Let’s dig a little deeper into that. When did you first start noticing this increased tiredness, despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It’s been… oh, probably about three months now. I started using the machine regularly in February, and for the first couple of months, it was a real game changer. I felt so much more awake! But then, gradually, the tiredness crept back in. Not as bad as before the machine, mind you, but still… noticeable. It’s just frustrating, you know? I was hoping for a complete fix.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Moshe. It’s disappointing when something doesn’t work as expected. Okay, so it sounds like the CPAP helped initially, but the benefit has decreased over the past three months. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my wife – we're divorced now, but we still talk occasionally – she pointed out I seem a bit… grumpier than usual. And I've been having a harder time concentrating. Little things, really. Forgetting where I put my glasses, that sort of thing. It’s not major, but it's all happening at the same time as the tiredness. I don’t know if it's connected, but it feels like it might be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Grumpiness and difficulty concentrating along with the tiredness and forgetfulness. Let’s get a bit more specific about the tiredness. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no tiredness at all and 10 being completely exhausted, where would you rate your tiredness on a typical day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. On a typical day? I’d say… a solid 6, maybe a 7. It's not debilitating, I can still get through my day, but I definitely don't have the energy I used to. I find myself needing little naps in the afternoon sometimes, which I never used to do. It makes it hard to keep up with my reading, you know? I teach history, so I do a lot of reading. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6 or 7, needing afternoon naps, and impacting your reading – that gives me a clearer picture. Now, let’s talk about the CPAP machine itself. Are you using it every night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Every single night. I make sure of it. It’s a little noisy, to be honest, but I've gotten used to it. I clean it regularly, too. My daughter, bless her heart, helped me set up a schedule for that. I try to follow it religiously. I know it’s important to keep everything clean and functioning properly. I've got the mask, the hose, the machine itself… the whole setup.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Moshe, that you’re diligent with the machine. It’s essential for it to be effective. Do you ever notice any leaks in the mask while you're sleeping?
PATIENT: Leaks? Hmm… sometimes, yes. Not every night, but occasionally I’ll wake up and feel air escaping around the edges of the mask. It doesn't happen often, but it’s enough to wake me up sometimes. I try to adjust it, but it’s hard to get it just right. It’s a little uncomfortable, too, sometimes. I’ve tried a few different sizes, but none of them feel perfect.
DOCTOR: Okay, mask leaks and discomfort – that’s definitely something we need to address. It could be significantly contributing to your tiredness. Before we go further, can you tell me a bit about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I used to be a smoker, but I quit about thirty years ago. My cholesterol is a little high, but the doctor says it's manageable with diet and exercise... though I admit I don't exercise as much as I should. And I have Medicare, of course. Do you need a full list of medications? I think I have it written down somewhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind. Knowing your medications is very important. And thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure and past gallbladder removal. Okay, so high blood pressure, past gallbladder removal, former smoker, and slightly elevated cholesterol. Let’s talk about those medications now. What are you currently taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Alright, let me see… I have it here. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And I also take a small dose of Atorvastatin, 10 milligrams, also once a day for the cholesterol. I’ve been taking both for about five years now, I think. And sometimes, if my blood pressure is particularly high, the doctor will prescribe a diuretic, but I haven’t needed that in a while. I try to be very good about taking them on time, every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg and Atorvastatin 10mg daily. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way, I suppose. My wife… my ex-wife, she had a peanut allergy, but I don’t. I’ve eaten everything under the sun without any problems. I used to travel quite a bit, you see, and I always tried the local cuisine. I always figured if I was going to get sick, it wouldn’t be from the food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s quickly go over your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had heart disease, he died of a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my mother had diabetes, though she lived to be a pretty good age, almost ninety. My brother has arthritis, but that’s about it, really. No history of cancer that I’m aware of. My family wasn’t big on talking about health problems, to be honest. It was a different time, you see. They didn’t really focus on preventive care like they do now.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and diabetes. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one glass, usually. Maybe two if it's a special occasion. I don’t drink every day, maybe three or four times a week. It’s nothing excessive, I assure you. I used to drink more when I was younger, but I’ve cut back a lot. It's more of a habit now, a little something to relax with. And it goes well with my paella, you know. I make a pretty good paella.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine a few times a week. And finally, do you smoke currently or use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I quit smoking thirty years ago, as I mentioned before. I haven’t touched a cigarette since. I used to smoke a pipe, but I gave that up when I quit the cigarettes. I’m very proud of that, actually. It was a difficult habit to break, but I managed it. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done for my health.
