DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, good to meet you too, Doctor… Havird, is it? I just… well, it’s a small thing. Really. I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “get well” card, maybe? Or just something… encouraging. My niece, she thinks I’m a bit down. She’s a good girl, but she worries too much. It’s silly, really.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Just a little something. You know, to show my niece I’m… alright. She keeps fussing over me. I told her I’m fine, perfectly fine! But she doesn’t listen. A note from you, the doctor, that would… carry some weight, you understand? It’s just… reassurance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, you’ve come to a medical clinic. I’m a doctor, and my role is to address health concerns. While I appreciate your niece’s concern for you, a “get well” card isn’t quite within my purview. Are you experiencing any actual medical symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… no, not exactly. I’m… tired, I suppose. A little achy, like an old machine needing oil. But that’s just getting older, isn’t it? It's not sick, Doctor. It’s just… life. I just thought… a little note, to make her stop worrying. You see a lot of people, you must have plenty of blank cards lying around. It wouldn't be any trouble.
DOCTOR: “Tired” and “achy” can be symptoms of many things, Mr. Kammer. It’s my job to investigate those, even if you don’t think it’s serious. And no, we don't have "blank cards lying around." We have medical records, examination rooms, and a responsibility to provide proper healthcare. Now, let’s try this again. Have you noticed any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Well, my appetite ain’t what it used to be. I don’t eat much, truth be told. And… I sleep a lot. More than I used to. But that’s just because… well, I’ve earned it, haven’t I? Sixty-six years of keeping things running. It takes it outta a man, you know? Still, I get by. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and increased sleep… Those are changes we should look into. And it’s never a bother to discuss your health concerns. It's my job. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Now that you mention it, my pants are a little looser. Not much, mind you. Just a bit. I haven’t weighed myself in… oh, a long time, probably. It’s not something I pay attention to. I just figured it was the heat. Makes you sweat, doesn’t it? Still, a little weight loss… you think that’s something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, unexplained weight loss is something we need to investigate. It can be a sign of several underlying conditions. I'm going to need to ask you some more questions, and then I'll do a physical exam. It's important to rule out anything serious, even if you feel fine otherwise. Do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes. But the doctor always said it was nothing to worry about, just watch the salt. Other than that… nothing much. I’ve always been a strong man. Worked hard my whole life. Never really got sick. I’m telling you, Doctor, I’m probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, hypertension… Okay. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… That's where it gets tricky. I… I don't really take them anymore. The pills made me feel… funny. Drowsy, mostly. And my niece, she keeps reminding me I’m supposed to, but I just… forget. It’s not that I don’t listen, it’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. And honestly, I felt better without them.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, stopping your blood pressure medication can be dangerous. It’s crucial for managing your health. And forgetting medications could indicate a more significant issue. We need to address both of these things. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to take some kind of pill when I was a kid, for a fever, maybe? But that was a long time ago. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. I just wanted a little card for my niece.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you’d like a card for your niece. However, my priority is your health. We’ve discussed several concerning points: stopping your blood pressure medication, unexplained weight loss, decreased appetite, increased sleep, and potential memory issues. I need to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can we proceed with that now?
PATIENT: Physical examination… Well, I suppose. If you insist. But I’m telling you, you won’t find anything wrong. It’s just old age, that’s all. But… alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones ain’t what they used to be. And please, don’t keep me too long. I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat on the examination table. And yes, I understand about the garden. We'll try to be brief.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Lead the way. Though I still think this is a bit much for a simple man. My niece worries too much. Always has.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Just relax and breathe normally. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, 88 beats per minute. Sounds are regular, but a bit diminished. Breathing sounds are a little diminished bilaterally, with some mild wheezing on exhalation.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Diminished sounds? Sounds… concerning. See? I told you I was fine! It's just the dust in the air, Doctor. I work in the garden all day. Lots of pollen. Always has bothered my chest a little. It's nothing. Really. My father had the same thing, a little cough now and then, but he lived to be ninety!
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back. I’m going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. No acute tenderness to palpation. I'm noticing some mild resistance in the lower quadrants. Can you tell me if you've had any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… well, not really. Everything’s… regular, I suppose. Maybe a little slower, now that I think about it. But nothing to worry about. Old age, you know? Things slow down. Just like everything else. You’re pressing a little hard, Doctor. No offense, but it feels… intrusive.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Kammer. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your health. Now, let’s check your extremities. Please extend your arms and legs. I’m going to assess your range of motion and check for any swelling or tenderness. Range of motion is slightly limited in your knees and elbows. Some mild swelling noted in your ankles bilaterally. Do you experience any pain in your joints?
PATIENT: Pain? A little. Mostly when it's cold. Or when I've been working in the garden for too long. It’s just… aches and pains, Doctor. Old age, again. You’ve heard that before, haven’t you? My niece keeps telling me I should see a specialist for my knees, but I don’t need any fancy treatments. Just a little liniment and a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical examination, I’m noting several concerning findings: elevated heart rate, diminished breathing sounds with wheezing, abdominal distension, limited range of motion in your knees and elbows, and swelling in your ankles. We need to run some tests to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a chest X-ray, and an EKG. Would you be able to provide a urine sample as well?
PATIENT: Tests? A chest X-ray? Now you're really scaring me, Doctor. I told you, it's just old age! I don't need a battery of tests. I just wanted a little card! This is… excessive. A urine sample? I barely have enough energy to get out of this chair. Look, maybe you could just… write me a note saying I'm healthy enough to tend to my garden? That's all my niece needs to hear. Forget the tests, forget the X-rays. Just a simple note, that's all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to investigate these findings thoroughly. Dismissing these symptoms as “just old age” would be irresponsible. Your niece is concerned for a reason, and I am concerned as well. We need to rule out any serious conditions, such as heart failure, pneumonia, or kidney problems. I can write a note stating you are undergoing evaluation for your concerns, but I will not write a note stating you are healthy when we haven’t completed the necessary tests. That would be unethical. We can start with the urine sample and a simple blood draw. Then we can schedule the chest X-ray. If you're unable to provide a urine sample, we can schedule an in-office catheterization. It’s not pleasant, but it’s necessary. Will you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Catheterization?! No, no, absolutely not! You're trying to scare an old man to death, that's what you're doing! I’m perfectly fine, I tell you! I just wanted a little encouragement for my niece. This is ridiculous. Look, I'm leaving. I don't need your tests, I don't need your X-rays, and I certainly don’t need a catheterization. You can forget about the note. Forget about everything. I'm going home to tend to my garden. And frankly, Doctor, I think you need to find a new profession if all you do is scare your patients.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're frustrated, but I am only trying to provide you with the best possible care. Dismissing your symptoms and refusing evaluation is not in your best interest. I am obligated to follow the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, which prioritizes patient safety and well-being. However, I respect your autonomy. If you are refusing all evaluation and treatment, I must document your refusal in your medical record. I will provide you with a written summary of our conversation, including the symptoms you reported and the tests you refused. I strongly advise you to reconsider, but ultimately, the decision is yours. .
PATIENT: .
