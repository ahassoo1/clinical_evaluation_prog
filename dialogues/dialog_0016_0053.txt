DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. It’s just… difficult to start, and then it feels like it doesn't quite all come out, you know? It's been going on for maybe a week or so now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty starting and a feeling of incomplete emptying – that can definitely be uncomfortable. About a week, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. Maybe a little longer, honestly. It’s hard to say exactly. I keep meaning to write things down, but… well, you know how it is. It's not painful, exactly, just… frustrating. And I find myself having to go more often, even if I don't feel like I need to.
DOCTOR: Right, frustrating is a good way to put it. And the increased frequency even with not feeling the urge... Okay. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Well, it seems to be worse in the mornings, usually. When I first wake up, I really have to strain. And then later in the day it's… not better, exactly, but not as bad as first thing. I haven't really noticed it being different after meals or anything. I drink about the same amount of tea every day, maybe two or three big mugs. I haven't changed anything, not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the mornings, with straining, and tea consumption is consistent. That's helpful. Now, just to be thorough, are you having any pain with urination, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not even a little bit of burning. And no, I haven’t seen any blood. Definitely not. That would worry me a lot. It’s just… the difficulty. It’s like something is blocking it, but there’s no pain, you know? It's a very strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain or blood is reassuring. And you're right, the lack of pain is important to note. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, now that you mention it, I have been getting up more at night. Not every night, but maybe two or three times a week, which is more than usual. I always thought it was just because I'm getting older, you know? But maybe it’s connected to this trouble I’m having. It’s not a full bladder, just… a little urge. Enough to wake me up, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, nocturia – waking up at night to urinate – that's another piece of the puzzle. And it's good you're recognizing changes and connecting them. Let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have a history of any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. High blood pressure, yes, I was diagnosed about ten years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication ever since. The doctor checks it regularly. And… no diabetes, no. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago, but they took it out. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, for my age, I think. I try to walk every day, you know? Keep moving. I take a water pill for the blood pressure too, a small one. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, the water pill is good to know, thank you. It's important information. Okay, and just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Let me see… Besides the blood pressure medication, I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said my levels were low. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it's really acting up. It’s called… um… let me look it up on my phone. One moment. It’s naproxen. Just when I have a really bad day. Not every day, though. Maybe a couple of times a week, when it's really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so vitamin D, naproxen as needed for arthritis. Good. And just one more question before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven't been stung since I was a little girl. I eat everything, pretty much. No food allergies, no medicine allergies. I think I’d know if I did, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No known allergies. Alright, Kandy, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better sense of things. We’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a gentle exam of your lower abdomen to check for tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m a bit sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, I’m just listening to your abdomen now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me. Sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on your lower abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort there. It feels… normal, I guess. A little pressure, but not painful at all. It’s just… I’m a bit ticklish, you know? Maybe be gentle on the sides?
DOCTOR: Okay, I am being gentle now. No significant tenderness on the sides either. I’m not feeling any masses or anything concerning. Bladder feels full, as expected. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Okay, Kandy, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, even though you're a woman. It is less common in women but can occur with bladder outlet obstruction and cause these symptoms. The increased frequency, straining, and feeling of incomplete emptying are all consistent with that, and it can explain the nocturia too. Your history of high blood pressure and the water pill you're on can also contribute to these symptoms.
PATIENT: BPH? But that’s a man’s problem, isn’t it? I’m a woman! Bladder… obstruction? Oh dear. What does that mean? And is it serious? Should I be worried? I don't want any surgery!
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, it is typically a man's condition. However, women can experience similar issues with bladder outlet obstruction. It happens when something blocks the flow of urine out of the bladder, and it can be caused by various things, like pelvic organ prolapse, weakened bladder muscles, or even nerve damage. It’s not as common as in men, but it can definitely happen. And no, it doesn’t automatically mean surgery! Most cases can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. We need to confirm the diagnosis first with some tests. I'd like to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection and a postvoid residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. We may also consider an ultrasound to get a better look at your bladder and kidneys. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a lot. Tests, ultrasound… I suppose that’s better than surgery, right away? A urinalysis, I can understand. And the post… what did you call it? Residual volume? Does that involve a… a catheter? I really don’t like those things. And an ultrasound… is that the one where they put gel on your tummy? I guess if it’s necessary. Just… please explain everything clearly, Doctor. I get nervous easily. And how long will these tests take? I have a bridge game on Friday!
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, and I’m happy to explain everything. Yes, a postvoid residual volume test measures the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It can be done in a couple of ways. The most common is with a handheld ultrasound device – no gel needed for that one! It’s completely non-invasive. The other method involves a catheter, but we can definitely avoid that if possible. So, let’s start with the handheld ultrasound after your urine sample. The urinalysis is just a routine urine test, we’ll check for infection and other issues. And the ultrasound will give us a picture of your bladder and kidneys to make sure everything looks normal. The tests themselves shouldn’t take long – maybe 30 minutes in total. The results will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, let's talk about some things you can do to help manage your symptoms. I recommend limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, as they can irritate the bladder. And try to drink plenty of water throughout the day, but avoid drinking large amounts before bedtime. We can also discuss some pelvic floor exercises – also known as Kegel exercises – to strengthen your bladder muscles. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay, no catheter right away, that’s good. And limiting caffeine… well, I do love my tea. But I can try. And Kegel exercises… I’ve heard of those. My friend, Elina, told me about them. She had… problems after the babies. So, tea in the morning, less water before bed, and try the exercises. And we wait for the test results. A few days, you said? That’s… okay. What about the medication? You mentioned it earlier. What kind of medication might you prescribe? And could it interact with my blood pressure pills? I worry about those, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s right, tea in the morning, less water before bed, and we'll try the Kegel exercises. Excellent. As for medication, if the tests confirm bladder outlet obstruction, we might consider a medication called a beta-3 adrenergic agonist. It helps to relax the bladder muscles and improve urine flow. Another option, if appropriate, is an anticholinergic medication, which can help reduce bladder spasms. We would start with a low dose and carefully monitor your response. And importantly, yes, we would definitely check for any potential interactions with your blood pressure medication. That's standard procedure. I have your medication list right here, and I’ll make sure to review everything carefully before prescribing anything. We will also want to keep an eye on your blood pressure while you are on any new medication. I’ll give you clear instructions on what to watch out for, and you can always call the office if you have any concerns. Now, do you have any questions about the Kegel exercises?
PATIENT: Oh, Kegel exercises… Elina said they were hard to do right. Like, you have to squeeze the right muscles, but not your tummy, and not your… everything else. It’s confusing! Is there a way to make sure I’m doing them correctly? A pamphlet, maybe? Or a video? And how often do I have to do them? I don’t want to spend all day squeezing! It sounds silly, but it’s important, right? If it helps me not have to go to the bathroom all the time. And just to be clear… you’ll check for interactions with my pills before I take anything? Really, really check?
DOCTOR: You’re right, Kegel exercises can be tricky to get right, and you're very smart to ask! Elina is right to warn you. It’s all about isolating those specific pelvic floor muscles. We have excellent pamphlets with diagrams and clear instructions, and I can also email you a link to a reputable video demonstrating the proper technique. The key is to focus on squeezing the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine midstream, without tightening your tummy, buttocks, or thighs. You should be able to breathe normally while doing them. As for frequency, we usually start with 10-15 repetitions, three times a day. We can adjust that based on your comfort and tolerance. You don't want to spend all day squeezing, that's for sure! And absolutely, I will thoroughly check for any potential interactions with your blood pressure medication before prescribing anything. I use a medication interaction checker that scans all of your current medications, and I’ll also review your medical history to make sure everything is safe. Your health and safety are my top priorities. Now, do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. The pamphlet and the video will be helpful, and I appreciate you checking my pills so carefully. I feel a little better knowing what’s going on, and that it’s not… something terrible. Thank you. I’ll try the tea and the squeezing, and I’ll wait for the test results. And I'll call if I have any problems. You’ve been very kind. And patient, especially with an old lady like me.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Kandy. You’re very welcome, and please, don’t think of yourself as an "old lady"! You're very proactive about your health, and that’s what matters. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and please let me know how the exercises are going. And enjoy your bridge game on Friday!
