DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Rowbottom’s the name. I suppose I’m here because… well, it’s rather unpleasant to talk about, frankly. I noticed something… in my stool. Blood. A bit of it, mind you, not a gusher. Still, a man doesn’t want that showing up. Especially not at my age. It's… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, I understand. It is concerning to see blood in your stool, and you're right to get it checked out. It’s good you came in. We'll figure out what's going on. When did you first notice this?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn’t yesterday, if that’s what you’re getting at. Probably… a few days ago now. Lost track, truthfully. Happens when you get to be my age, you know. Things just…blur. Maybe four or five days? Possibly longer. It’s not like I meticulously examine everything, Doctor. I just noticed it. And it bothered me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. Four or five days ago is helpful. And it’s perfectly reasonable not to be meticulously examining things – you came to me because you noticed something different, and that's exactly the right thing to do. Can you describe what the blood looked like?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn’t bright red, gushing out like…like a stuck pig, thankfully. It was…darker. Almost brownish, really. Mixed in with everything else, you understand. Not just a streak on top, but in it. And not a lot, mind you. A little. Enough to make a body uneasy, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I've seen worse scrapes in my flying days. But… well, this is different. It's coming from…inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker, brownish blood mixed in, and not a large amount. And you're right to point out it's coming from inside – that does change things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits alongside this?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now that you mention it… perhaps. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about my… movements, if you catch my drift. But I think… yes. It's been a bit looser than usual, maybe? And I’ve been going… more frequently, I suppose. Not terribly so, mind you. But enough to notice. A man likes a bit of regularity, you see. It's… unsettling when things are off.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools and more frequent bowel movements. Thank you for letting me know. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea alongside this?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… a bit of a rumble in the tummy sometimes, yes. Not awful pain, mind you. Just… discomfort. Like something's not quite sitting right. And… yes, a bit queasy now and again. Not throwing up or anything, mind you, just a feeling of…well, being a bit off colour. It could be the weather, truthfully. This humidity is dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, some abdominal discomfort and a bit of nausea. It’s good you’re sharing all of this. It could be the weather, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions. Have you had any recent unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now there’s a question. My wife used to weigh me every week, bless her soul. A bit obsessive, she was. But since… well, since she left… I haven’t really kept track. I feel about the same, I suppose. Maybe a little thinner? But that could just be… getting older, you know. Things… sag. Everything sags eventually. I doubt it’s significant, Doctor. Not like I’m wasting away or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant unintentional weight loss that you’re aware of. I understand about your wife, and it's perfectly understandable that things have changed since she passed. Now, have you ever had any colonoscopies or other screenings for colon cancer?
PATIENT: Colonoscopies? Good heavens, no. What on earth for? Sounds like a dreadful invasion of privacy, that does. And frankly, I don't put much stock in all these newfangled medical procedures. My father lived to be 95 and never had any of this poking and prodding. Just ate his fish and chips and smoked his pipe. I followed suit for years, though I gave up the smoking, thank goodness. Never saw the point in sticking a camera where the sun don’t shine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior colonoscopies or screenings. I understand your skepticism, Mr. Rowbottom, and I respect your father’s lifestyle. However, guidelines have changed over the years, and screening can help detect problems early. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my knees, you understand. Arthritis. Getting old isn’t for sissies, that's for certain. And… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. Appendicitis, they called it. Dreadful pain. Beyond that… not much, thankfully. Been pretty lucky, all things considered. I broke a wrist once, crashing a plane, but that was… a long time ago. I’m not one for lingering on past ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for arthritis, and a previous appendectomy. That's good to know. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I'm aware of. I enjoy a good flower garden. Roses, mostly. Never had any trouble with them. No hives or swelling, nothing like that. I ate all sorts of things in my younger days, traveling around the world. Foreign foods, spicy things… never bothered me. I don't believe in coddling myself, you see. A bit of discomfort builds character.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your abdomen, and feeling it gently. It will just help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. But don’t go poking around too much, Doctor. I’m an old man, not a test subject. Gentle, you said? See that you are. I’ve had enough prodding for one day, truthfully. Get on with it. But I warn you, my skin is thin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Just a listen and a gentle feel. Okay, I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Your abdomen is soft, though I do feel some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. It's not severe, but it’s worth noting. Your skin is quite thin, as you said. Given your age, your symptoms, and the blood in your stool, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like diverticulitis or a simple inflammation. However, it’s important to rule out more serious conditions, such as colon cancer.
PATIENT: Colon cancer, you say? Hmph. That’s what I feared. Always something, isn’t it? My brother, bless his soul, had something similar. Dreadful business. So, what do you propose, Doctor? Another poking and prodding session? Perhaps a scan? Just get it over with, I say. I’m not getting any younger. Though, frankly, at my age, what difference does it make?
DOCTOR: You're right to want to get to the bottom of this, Mr. Rowbottom, and I understand your concerns, especially given your brother's experience. A scan is a good next step. I’d like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on inside. It’s a non-invasive procedure; you’ll just lie on a table while the machine takes images. In addition to the scan, I’d also like to order a stool test to check for blood and any signs of infection. And, I know you’re not keen on it, but ultimately, a colonoscopy would be the most definitive way to diagnose the problem. We can discuss that further once we have the results of the scan and stool test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A scan and a… stool test. Very well. Though I still maintain all this poking and prodding is unnecessary. And a colonoscopy? Out of the question, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve lived a good life, and I’m not subjecting myself to that at my age. Let's see what the scan reveals first. And then we’ll talk. But no colonoscopy. Understood?
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Rowbottom. No colonoscopy at this time. We'll start with the CT scan and stool test, and we’ll go from there. I will write you a referral for the scan now. You can schedule it at your convenience. The lab order for the stool test will be sent electronically to the lab closest to your home. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once I have them, my nurse will call to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or a significant change in your bowel habits – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Hmph. No, I suppose not. Just get the scan done as quickly as possible, Doctor. And please, tell your nurse to call promptly. I don’t have all day, you know. This waiting is… unsettling. Very well then. I think that will be all. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I'm not convinced this was particularly helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll make sure the orders are sent through immediately, and my nurse will be in touch as soon as the results are available. I understand your apprehension, and I'll do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Rowbottom.
