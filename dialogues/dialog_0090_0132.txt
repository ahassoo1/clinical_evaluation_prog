DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's this heat, see? Can't take it like I used to. Makes me feel right awful. Just…sweaty and weak, all the time. Never used to be this bad. Back home, the heat was dry heat. This is…sticky. Makes a fella feel useless.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, adjusting to a new climate can certainly be…difficult. You say you’re feeling weak?
PATIENT: Difficult? That's putting it mildly. Weak, yes. And dizzy sometimes. Like I'm gonna faint. Not all the time, thankfully. But enough to worry a man. I try to keep busy, you know? Painting, little bit of fixing around the house…can't do much when you're feeling like that, though. It’s just…not right. A man should be able to handle a bit of weather.
DOCTOR: Painting and fixing things…hm. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... It started properly, I'd say, about a month ago. Maybe six weeks. Right around when it really started getting hot. Before that, it was just normal summer heat. I could work all day, no problem. But now? A couple of hours and I'm done for. It's slowing me down, Doctor. Slowing me right down. A man's got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else accompanying this weakness and dizziness?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Hmm… well, I don’t sleep as well. Toss and turn, even with the fan on full blast. And I haven't much of an appetite, to be honest. Everything just seems…bland. Not like it used to taste. Not that I eat fancy, mind you. But even a good curry doesn’t hit the spot these days. It's a strange feeling, all around. Makes a fella wonder what's going on.
DOCTOR: Loss of sleep and decreased appetite…Okay. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Not really. Never been much of a sickly man, Doctor. Had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, chickenpox…but nothing serious. Years ago, my back went out a few times, from the painting, but a good chiropractor fixed that right up. Nothing that requires…pills or anything like that. Mostly just keep myself busy and stay out of trouble. That’s my medicine, you see.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father, he lived a long life. Made it to eighty-five, working the land his whole life. Strong man, he was. Mother died younger, maybe sixty-ish, from…well, I don't rightly remember. Something with her chest, I think. But it was a long time ago. They didn’t have much in the way of doctors back home. Just…old wives’ tales and herbal remedies. Didn’t do much good, if you ask me. Mostly just waited it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. None. Never been one for popping pills. I've always believed in letting the body heal itself. A bit of rest, a good meal, that's all a man needs. I don't trust those things, all those side effects… heard too many stories. No, thank you very much. I manage just fine on my own. Mostly. This heat's just…different.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at you then. If you don’t mind stepping up on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Always with the poking and prodding. But alright. Don't go expecting miracles, Doctor. I'm a working man, not a porcelain doll.
DOCTOR: 77 kilograms. And your height is 172 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: That's right, Doctor. Always been a bit on the sturdy side. Good for lifting and carrying, see? Never been a skinny fella. But I keep myself active, I do. It's this heat, I tell you. It's making everything feel…wrong. Not like my usual self.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 110/70. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear…though your breathing is a bit shallow. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: There! See? Not much pep in these legs these days. It's not just the heat, Doctor, it's… well, it's getting old, I suppose. Not that I'm complaining. Just…slowing down. Still, a man shouldn’t feel this weak, should he? A good curry usually sorts me out, but it ain’t working this time.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let's take a look at your throat. A little dry, but no sign of infection. Well, everything appears to be structurally normal, Mr. Coby. It sounds like you may be experiencing some dehydration and heat exhaustion.
PATIENT: Dehydration? Heat exhaustion? I drink plenty of water, Doctor. Always have. And I’ve worked in the sun my whole life. It’s not just that. It’s… a feeling. Like something's off. Not just tired, but… hollow. A bit like when you've had a bad dream, but it lingers all day. Doesn't sound like just a bit of heat, does it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, you’ve come to me complaining of weakness, dizziness, loss of appetite, and difficulty sleeping. You also mentioned a "hollow" feeling. While those symptoms can be caused by several factors, the most likely explanation, given your recent arrival in a hotter climate and your description of the onset, is dehydration exacerbated by heat exposure. We can run some blood tests to rule out other possibilities, but I suspect that simply increasing your fluid intake and avoiding strenuous activity during the hottest parts of the day will alleviate your symptoms. However, if the symptoms persist, we can consider a referral to a specialist.
PATIENT: Blood tests? Specialist? For a bit of heat? Doctor, I’ve been working with my hands since I was a boy. I know my body. This ain’t just a bit of thirst. It's more than that, and I'd like you to listen to me. Running tests and sending me off to someone else just feels like… wasting time. Is there anything else we can do? Something to actually help a man feel like himself again?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration. However, I am a medical professional, and it is my duty to rule out any potential underlying medical conditions before attributing your symptoms solely to heat exposure. That said, to address your immediate concerns, we can try a course of oral rehydration salts in addition to increasing your water intake. I’ll also prescribe a mild multivitamin, though I doubt that will make a significant difference. If you still aren't feeling better in a week, then we'll discuss a referral to a specialist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oral rehydration salts… a multivitamin… Seems like a lot of fuss for a bit of heat. But fine. A week, you say? And then a specialist? Alright. But if I'm still feeling this hollow, Doctor, I’m not wasting any time. I’ll want someone who actually listens to a man, not just looks at numbers. So, how do I get these salts? And this… multivitamin?
DOCTOR: Here is a prescription for the oral rehydration salts and the multivitamin. You can pick them up at the pharmacy down the street. Be sure to drink the rehydration solution throughout the day, and take the multivitamin with a meal. Avoid strenuous activity, especially during the hottest hours. And, if your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll discuss a referral. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… try to remember, a man knows his own body. I’ll take these salts, but I’m not promising miracles. Thank you… I suppose. And if I do need to come back, I hope you’ll actually listen to what I’m saying.
