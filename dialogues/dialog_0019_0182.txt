DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Renzi, you said? Honestly, I haven’t got all day. It’s this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a “clearance” before I go through with it. Says it's important. Seems like a lot of fuss over a little smoothing out, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right, a procedure… and your daughter suggested this check-up. Smoothing out… is that a cosmetic procedure, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Well, obviously. What else would it be? Look, I'm not here to discuss the merits of vanity with a… a young man. Just tell me what you need to know so I can get this over with. It’s for my face, alright? A little… saggy skin. Nothing drastic. It's just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: No need to get upset, Mr. Orwin. I understand. We just want to make sure you're healthy enough for any procedure, even a minor one. It’s standard practice. So, just to clarify, you’re having some skin laxity on your face addressed. Have you had anything like this done before?
PATIENT: Done before? Good heavens, no! I’m 81 years old, not some… some Hollywood type. This is my first foray into all this nonsense. I’ve always taken care of myself, good Scandinavian genes, you know. But… well, time catches up with everyone. It’s just… irritating to look in the mirror these days. Now, can we hurry this up? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. We'll be as quick as possible. Just a few questions to get a good picture of your overall health. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions—things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else your regular doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh, for crying out loud. Now you want my life story? Let me think… I had a touch of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but it mostly sorts itself out. And… well, my blood pressure’s been a little high at times, but nothing a little less salt doesn't fix. Otherwise, I’m as healthy as a… well, a fairly old Norwegian. I see Dr. Lindstrom, down on Elm Street. He’s a good man. Though, he’s always trying to get me to take pills. Now, is that enough? Can we move on?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Arthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure… we'll make a note of that. Dr. Lindstrom, excellent. We can request records from him if you'd like. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a knee replacement about fifteen years ago. It’s been… alright. A bit stiff sometimes, but I manage. Anything else? Honestly, I'm drawing a blank. It was a while back. I don’t see why any of this matters for a little… face lift. Now, are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a knee replacement… good to know. We just want to be thorough, Mr. Orwin. Sometimes, past surgeries can affect how we approach a new procedure. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis when it flares up. Ibuprofen, mostly. And sometimes, a half-dose aspirin if I feel a bit… creaky. That's it. I don't believe in loading up on pills, you know. Natural is best. Now, are you going to ask me about my diet next? I had a lovely smoked salmon for breakfast. Does that count? Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Smoked salmon sounds lovely! No, we won’t dwell on the diet, Mr. Orwin. Ibuprofen and occasional aspirin… alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I know of. I eat everything. Well, maybe not oysters. Never liked oysters. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated. I just want to get this over with. Are you quite finished? I have a perfectly good herring waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Mr. Orwin, I promise. Just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My grandfather smoked, and he coughed his lungs out. Never touched a cigarette in my life. As for alcohol… well, I enjoy a glass of aquavit with dinner sometimes. Maybe two. It's Scandinavian tradition, you know. Helps with digestion. And keeps the cold away. It’s not like I’m a… a lush! Just a civilized gentleman enjoying a little drink with his meal. Now, please tell me we’re nearly done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just one last thing. Do you have any family history of any serious medical conditions—like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be 95, bless her soul. She was as tough as nails. My father… he had a bit of a weak heart, I think. But he didn’t take care of himself. Always eating rich foods and… well, he was a bit of a worry. Aside from that… not really. We’re a pretty hardy bunch, Scandinavians. Now, is that it? Can I finally go and enjoy my lunch? I’m starting to lose my appetite just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for your patience. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your face. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must you? Very well, get it over with. But be quick about it. I have a perfectly good herring waiting, and I don’t want it getting cold. And please, no poking and prodding! I’m a delicate flower, you know. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. Gentle as can be. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, as we discussed. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, let me take a quick look at your face. Skin turgor is decreased, consistent with age. Some areas of mild sagging, as you described. Overall, you appear to be in fairly good health for your age.
PATIENT: Must you point out every little imperfection? Honestly. A little sagging skin is hardly a medical crisis. And a murmur? Everyone has a murmur these days. Now, what does all this mean? Can I have the procedure, or not? I haven’t got all day to listen to your medical opinions. Just tell me straight. Yes or no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on my examination and your medical history, you are generally a good candidate for the procedure. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur do require a little caution. It's important to manage your blood pressure, and it would be best to have a cardiologist clear you for surgery, just to be on the safe side. I'm not saying you can't have the procedure, but I would strongly recommend getting a cardiac evaluation before proceeding. It's a standard precaution to minimize any potential risks. Do you have a cardiologist you see regularly?
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Now you’re telling me I need another doctor? This is ridiculous! My blood pressure is just a little high, not a life-threatening crisis. And a murmur… everyone gets old, you know. Honestly, I’m starting to regret this whole thing. I just wanted a little smoothing out, not a full medical workup. No, I don’t have a cardiologist. Dr. Lindstrom handles all my… general health. But I highly doubt he'll want to get involved in this… vanity project. This is becoming far too complicated. Tell you what, just write me a note saying I’m cleared, alright? I’ll sign whatever waivers you need. I'm a grown man, I can take the risk.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for surgery without a proper cardiac evaluation. It’s not about vanity; it's about ensuring your safety. Even a minor procedure carries risks, and we need to minimize those as much as possible. I am ethically obligated to prioritize your well-being, and that means taking a cautious approach. I can certainly write a note detailing your medical history and my findings, but it will explicitly state that a cardiac evaluation is recommended before proceeding. I can provide you with the name of a highly reputable cardiologist I work with, if you'd like. Dr. Anya Sharma, she's excellent. However, if you choose to proceed without a cardiac evaluation, I must document that you were informed of the risks and that you declined the recommendation. What would you like me to do?
