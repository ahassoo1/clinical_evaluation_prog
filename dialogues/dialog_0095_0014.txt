DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, bless her heart, she says I need to get some papers. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with things if I… can't work. I get a little mixed up these days, you see. It has to do with my job, I think. Directors, Religious Activities... that’s what she called it. I mostly just… do things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you're a Director of Religious Activities. And your wife is concerned about your ability to continue working... Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She worries. I don’t feel sick, exactly. Just… tired. And sometimes I forget things. Important things. It's been happening more lately, and she says we need to look into… FMLA, was it? Or something like that? To protect things, she said. I wouldn't even know where to begin with those papers.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increasing fatigue and some memory issues. When did you first start noticing these changes, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a tricky one. It’s not like a sudden thing, you see. It’s been creeping up on me. Maybe… six months ago? It started with little things. Forgetting names, misplacing my glasses… things old men do, I figured. But it's gotten… more noticeable. Harder to ignore. I'm not sure I can pinpoint a date, exactly. My wife probably has a better idea. She keeps a calendar. A very detailed one.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this fatigue been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days I feel… alright. Not exactly young, mind you, but able to get things done. Other days… well, other days I just want to sit. Do nothing. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… the energy just drains away. And then I get confused easily. Makes things… difficult. Especially when I'm trying to… organize things. Which is a big part of my job, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating fatigue and confusion. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… my wife has been saying I haven't been eating as much. I haven't really noticed, to be honest. I still feel hungry, sometimes. But… I just don't seem to have the appetite I used to. And she says I’ve lost a bit of weight. Though, to be fair, she worries about everything. She's a good woman, my wife. Always looking out for me. I wouldn't know exactly how much weight, though. She's the one who keeps track of those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. And… oh, and something for my arthritis, in my hands. They get so stiff, you see. As for allergies… not that I know of. Never been much of an allergy sufferer. Though, my wife says I'm allergic to… complaining, maybe? I truly don't remember the names of the pills, Doctor. She manages all that for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need to get a list of those medications from her. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms, like headaches, vision changes, or any difficulty with your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. Maybe a little bit of tension sometimes, but nothing major. Vision changes… now that you mention it, things haven't been as clear lately. Especially when I’m reading. I find myself holding things further away. And… my balance… sometimes I feel a little unsteady on my feet. Not falling or anything, just… a little wobbly. Especially when I stand up quickly. It’s probably just old age catching up with me, though. It all feels a bit muddled, you see. Like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We've covered a lot. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just some basic checks - blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a brief neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on. And maybe get those papers my wife keeps talking about. Those FMLA things. So I can… rest, if that's what I need to do. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, let's just check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 145 over 88. A bit elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Pulse is 72, regular rhythm. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And finally, let’s do a brief neurological exam… can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It's a little… blurry, though. Hard to focus sometimes. But I can see it. I think. Just let me know if I'm doing something wrong. I'm not used to… tests, you see. Mostly I just sit and… think. Or try to, anyway.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat a few simple words after me. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Though, don’t expect too much. My memory isn't what it used to be. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: … Apple… table… um… … Something with a ‘p’… a coin… a… I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s on the tip of my tongue… I can almost… but no. It won’t come. Penny! Yes, that’s it. Apple, table, penny. But it took me a moment. A long moment.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. No need to apologize. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The year… let me think. Is it… 2023? No, that can't be right. It feels… later than that. My wife always knows the date. I truly have no idea, Doctor. I'm so sorry. It just… slips my mind these days. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Mr. Limtiaco. Don’t worry about it. Okay, last quick check. I'm going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Gait is slightly unsteady, mild base widening noted. No noticeable tremors. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, there are several possibilities. The fatigue, memory issues, and some difficulty with coordination suggest a possible cognitive impairment. It could be due to a number of things – vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, early stages of dementia, or other underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other potential causes. I also recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation with a specialist.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dementia? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Well, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work… a specialist… I trust your judgment. My wife will want to know, of course. She'll have questions. Will the blood work tell us what’s causing the tiredness? And the forgetting? I just want to feel… normal again. And maybe get those papers… the FMLA things. So I can rest if I need to.
DOCTOR: It's important to remember that dementia is a broad term, Mr. Limtiaco, and we don't have enough information to make any definitive conclusions at this point. The blood work will help us rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. If those come back normal, then we’ll proceed with the neurological evaluation to get a more thorough assessment. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist at the regional hospital. She’s excellent. And I’ll also order the blood work and give you a lab slip. As for the FMLA, I can certainly write a note to your employer outlining your symptoms and recommending a period of leave for medical evaluation and potential treatment. It’s important to address this and prioritize your health. Let's focus on getting to the bottom of this first, and then we can discuss the paperwork. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A neurologist… Dr. Sharma, you said? I’ll ask my wife to schedule an appointment. And thank you for the note for my employer. That would be a great help. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor. It’s… unsettling, to feel like something is wrong. But I’m glad you’re taking it seriously. Perhaps with some tests, we can figure out what’s going on. And maybe, just maybe, I can get back to… thinking clearly again. Now, about those papers… the FMLA things? Can you tell me a bit more about them? Just so I know what to expect?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. The Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for specified family and medical reasons. In your case, it would be for your medical evaluation and potential treatment. I'll write a note to your employer outlining your symptoms and recommending the leave. However, the final decision regarding approval rests with your employer, based on their policies and your eligibility. The paperwork usually involves forms from both you and your employer, and may require documentation from me regarding your medical condition. I’ll provide you with as much support as possible throughout the process. Here’s the referral to Dr. Sharma and the lab slip for the blood work. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible, and get the blood work done within the next week. We can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. My wife will probably have a list of questions, but I’ll let her handle those. I appreciate your help, and your patience. It's… a relief to have a plan. And to know that we’re taking steps to figure things out. I should probably get going. My wife is probably wondering where I am. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Get home safely, and take care.
