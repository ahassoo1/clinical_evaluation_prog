DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… about my blood, I think? My daughter, she said I really ought to know my… type. For, you know, just in case. Something about needing it if… things happen. I don’t really remember all the details, honestly. It feels important, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Your daughter is… prudent. Knowing your blood type can be helpful, though most of the time it’s not something we urgently need to know unless you’re undergoing a procedure or, as she said, something happens. Still, we can certainly check it. Before we do that, just to get a fuller picture, have you been feeling unwell at all?
PATIENT: Unwell? Not really, no. Old, mostly. Everything aches a little, but that’s just… getting on in years, I suppose. I haven’t been sick, not a cold or anything. Just… tired sometimes. And a bit forgetful, but that's been happening for… well, a long time. Does that count as unwell? I don't know, honestly.
DOCTOR: Tired and forgetful… and how long has this tiredness been going on, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. It comes and goes, you see. But… probably the last few years, I’d say. It’s not like I can’t do things, just… I need a bit more rest afterwards. And sometimes I misplace things, or forget what I was about to say… like now! What was I saying? Oh dear. It’s frustrating, mostly. It's just old age, I keep telling myself.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this memory loss interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Interfering… hmm. Not really interfering, no. More… inconvenient. I used to do a lot of… rigging, you see. For the theatre, mostly. Very technical work, needs a good memory. I don't do that anymore, though. Too much bending and lifting. So… no, it hasn’t stopped me from doing anything important. Just… things get lost. I forget names sometimes. It’s a bit embarrassing, really. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That's helpful. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you unintentionally lost or gained any weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is… small. Always has been. I don’t really eat a lot. My husband, bless his soul, always said I was a bird. And weight… well, I think I’ve lost a bit, maybe? It’s hard to say, I don’t really weigh myself anymore. The scale just…depresses me, you know? I haven’t been feeling particularly hungry or anything, just… not much interest in food.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… oh dear. That's a tough one. I had a… a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. Spent some time in hospital for that. And I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. Other than that… I think I had pneumonia once, when I was younger. But nothing major, I don't think. Honestly, my memory… it's like trying to grasp smoke. Did my daughter mention anything? She keeps all my records, you see. I'm hopeless with those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll check your records, don’t worry. Have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal and the wrist fracture?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don't believe so. Perhaps some things for my eyes when I was very young, but that was a long, long time ago. Nothing… major. Just the gallbladder and the wrist, as far as I can remember. Though, like I said, my daughter probably knows more. She worries so! She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… tricky. My father, he had… heart trouble, I think. He died when I was quite young. And my mother… she lived a long life, but she was always frail. I don't remember any other… major illnesses in the family. Everyone seemed to just… fade away, quietly. It wasn’t a very… dramatic family, if you know what I mean. Not much talk about illnesses, mostly just… acceptance. I’m not very good with details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just this, I think. A little something for my… arthritis. It helps with the aches and pains. And allergies… Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Though, sometimes I get a bit… itchy, after gardening. But that’s probably just the plants, you see? It’s not a proper allergy, just a bit of irritation. Would you like to see what it is?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. Alright. Now, Ms. Nini, just to clarify – you've been feeling tired for a few years, some forgetfulness, a decreased appetite, and you’ve lost some weight, but nothing that’s dramatically interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Tired, a bit forgetful… and I don't really have much of an appetite. And I think I’ve lost a bit of weight, but it's not like I'm starving or anything. It’s just… everything feels a bit… faded. And the aches and pains, of course. But who doesn't have those at my age, eh? You’ve got it pretty much spot on, Doctor. Now, about this blood type… is it a complicated test?
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we get to the blood type, I think it’s important to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. It's a standard procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Is that… necessary? I don’t feel particularly ill, you see. But… if you think it’s best, I suppose. I always trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nini. We'll be very gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please lie back on the table?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It's been a while since I was on one of these. Alright, go ahead, Doctor. Just… try not to startle me, alright? My heart doesn’t always behave itself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds… slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but breath sounds are slightly reduced. Let’s check your blood pressure. 130/80. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly concerning for your age. Now, I’m just going to take a look at your throat and ears.
PATIENT: Oh my. Everything feels a bit… poked and prodded. Not that I’m complaining, you understand. Just… it’s been a long time since anyone looked inside me. Is everything alright? It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… strange.
DOCTOR: Throat appears clear, no signs of infection. Ears are normal, some cerumen present, but no obstruction. Now, I’ll just feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No masses palpated. Some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, but not significant. And finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Ms. Nini. That concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh dear, that was… thorough. Is everything alright, Doctor? You were frowning a bit when you felt my tummy. Is something wrong? I told you, I don't feel very ill, you know. Perhaps it's just old age, creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Nini, everything appears generally within expected parameters for your age. The diminished breath sounds and reflexes are not uncommon. The mild tenderness in your right upper quadrant could be related to your gallbladder removal years ago, or simply some muscle strain. However, I do note some weight loss, and your fatigue and forgetfulness warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some routine blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. That will give us a better understanding of what might be going on. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: More tests? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. But if you think it's necessary… alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You're the expert, after all. What exactly will these tests do? Will they hurt? And what if they find something… wrong? I don't want to cause any fuss. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: The tests won’t hurt, Ms. Nini. It's just a simple blood draw. A phlebotomist will take a small sample of blood from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and there may be a slight pinch. As for what the tests will show… they will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms – things like anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. We're not looking for anything specific at this point, just gathering information. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the blood work?
PATIENT: A phlebotomist… oh dear. I’ve always been a bit squeamish around needles. But if it’s just a little pinch… alright. And what if… what if they find something bad? I don’t want to worry my daughter. She worries enough as it is. I suppose I should prepare myself for the worst, but… I really just want to know if it’s something simple. Like old age, creeping up on me. Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: It usually takes a few days to get the results back from the lab, Ms. Nini. And while it's good to be prepared, I want to assure you that we're not necessarily looking for anything serious. Most of the time, these tests come back normal. We’re simply being thorough, to ensure we address all potential causes of your symptoms. As for informing your daughter, that’s entirely up to you. I can certainly discuss the results with her directly if you prefer, or we can wait until you’ve had a chance to process them yourself. Now, about that blood type… we can go ahead and order that test as well, if you’d like. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you like me to write the orders now?
PATIENT: Alright, let’s just get everything done at once, then. The blood type, the other tests… everything. I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Yes, please, write the orders. And… perhaps you could call my daughter and let her know? She’s… very good at remembering things. And she’ll want to know all the details. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Now, where do I go to get all this done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. Here is your lab order. You'll need to take this to the lab downstairs. They’re open until 5pm today. It should take about 30-45 minutes. I've also noted your daughter’s contact information so they can contact her once the results are available. And I've added a note for your primary care physician to review the results with you. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect at the lab?
PATIENT: Downstairs, you say? Oh good. Not too far. And they’ll contact my daughter… that’s a relief. I always get lost. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, honestly. All these tests… it’s a lot to take in. Well, I suppose I’d better go get this done. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old woman like me. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nini. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take your time. We’ll be in touch once the results are available. Have a good day.
