DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I think. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, things have been… not right, lately. My memory, it is… slipping. It is very concerning, especially with my… blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. I understand your concern about your memory and blood pressure. It’s good you’re addressing this. Let's start with the memory issues. Could you describe what you mean by “slipping”?
PATIENT: Slipping… yes. It is difficult to explain. Small things, mostly. I will… put the kettle on to make tea, and then forget why I went to the kitchen. Or I will speak to someone, a neighbor perhaps, and… the name. The name is gone, just… vanished. It is not everything, Doctor, not yet. But it is enough to… worry me. I remember details, very clearly, but the… the main part, sometimes, it is missing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara, that’s helpful. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with recent memory – forgetting why you went somewhere or recalling names. And you feel you still have good recall of details, just trouble with the core information. To get a better understanding, could you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It started slowly, I thought it was just… being busy. I manage many properties, you see, and the community association… it keeps me very occupied. But it has become… more frequent, certainly in the last three months. I find myself… repeating questions to people, because I simply cannot remember if they told me already. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months, with a noticeable increase in the last three months. And it’s causing you some distress, understandably. Do you notice any pattern to when these memory lapses occur?
PATIENT: Pattern? Hmm. That is a good question. I… I think they are worse when I am tired. Or stressed. If there is a problem with a property, a leak, a difficult tenant… then it is much worse. But even when things are calm, it happens. It is… unpredictable. I try to write everything down, you see, but then sometimes… I forget where I wrote it down. It is… a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds very frustrating. Stress and fatigue can certainly play a role. Now, let’s talk about your blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medication for that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not. My husband… he always managed my medications. He… passed away two years ago. I have… not been to the doctor since. I feel… fine, mostly. A little tired, as I said. Sometimes a headache. But I thought that was just… age. And the stress. I… I have not wanted to bother anyone. It feels… silly, to complain about a little tiredness.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Alvara. It’s very important you’re here now, and it's good you’re sharing this with me. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that you haven't prioritized your own health. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your overall health and family history. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I want to understand what is happening. A physical exam… yes, please. I will cooperate fully. I… I just want this to be over with, if I am honest. It is… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. We'll take things one step at a time. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 150/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular, temperature is normal at 98.6, and your respiration rate is 16. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance is good. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions now to assess your cognitive function. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. Elevated blood pressure… I was expecting that, perhaps. My husband… he worried about that a great deal. The crackles in my lungs… is that serious? I do not smoke, I have never smoked. Please, ask your questions. I will answer as truthfully as I can. I just… I want to understand what is happening, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. The crackles could be due to a number of things - fluid buildup, or even just some residual congestion. We’ll need to investigate further. Now, let’s do a quick cognitive assessment. First, could you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. Let me see… It is… August. The second of August. Yes, the second of August, 2025. I… I think. I have been keeping track, you see, to help with my memory. It is… frustrating when I have to think about the date. It should just… be known.
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Ms. Alvara. August 2nd, 2025. Very good. Now, could you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a simple question. It is… I believe it is… Oakhaven. Yes, Oakhaven. It is a small town, not many people know it. I have lived here for… many years. It feels… strange to have to think about where I live. It should be automatic, yes?
DOCTOR: You are correct, Ms. Alvara. It is Oakhaven. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall three words. Please listen carefully, and I'll ask you to repeat them back to me after I finish. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat those three words for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I… I hope I remember them. It is… worrying how difficult this is becoming. I used to be able to remember so many things. Now… simple words. It is… disheartening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. That's good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: My vision… hmm. No, not really. It is… a little blurry sometimes, especially in the mornings. But I have always needed glasses, so I assumed it was just… that. Nothing sudden, nothing dramatic. Just… the usual for an old woman, I suppose. It has not… interfered with my daily life, thankfully. I can still read, I can still manage my properties. But… perhaps I should have it checked, now that you mention it. It feels… foolish to worry about eyesight when my memory is failing. But… it is a good question, Doctor. A very good question.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Ms. Alvara. Changes in vision can sometimes be connected to other health issues, so it’s good to consider. Now, have you experienced any weakness or numbness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No weakness or numbness. Everything… feels normal, in that regard. I have… some arthritis in my hands, a little stiffness, but that is just… age, I think. I can still do everything I need to do, thankfully. I can still drive, I can still garden… I am very active, considering. No… no weakness or numbness. I would have noticed that, surely. It feels… important to be able to move, to be independent. I have always prided myself on my independence.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Alvara. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high cholesterol, or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but I… I have always been very healthy, thankfully. A little tired, perhaps, but… nothing serious. I have never needed to take any medication, except for occasional pain relievers for my arthritis. And… I have never been in the hospital, except to give birth. It feels… strange to be talking about all of this, now that I am… forgetting things. It feels… like a betrayal, somehow. A betrayal of my own body, my own health.
DOCTOR: I understand how you feel, Ms. Alvara. It’s unsettling when things change. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any family members who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or other memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she was a little forgetful in her later years, but we just attributed it to age. She… she was very stressed, always worrying about something. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. I do not… I do not believe anyone else in my family has had… serious memory problems. Perhaps a distant cousin, but I do not know the details. It feels… important to know these things, now that I am… struggling. It feels… frightening to think it might be… hereditary.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That's helpful information. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I have never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that is all. And… I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I have always been a very… sensible woman. I believe in moderation, in taking care of myself. I have always prided myself on my… respectability. It feels… strange to even be asked such a question, now that I am… forgetting things. It feels… like you are questioning my character. But… I understand you must ask these things.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Ms. Alvara. I assure you, I am only trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what is going on. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I can take most medications without any problems. I… I have always been very lucky, in that regard. It feels… strange to be talking about all of this, now that I am… forgetting things. It feels… like I am losing control. But… I understand you must ask these things. It feels… important to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam I’ve performed, you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties, including memory lapses, and you have elevated blood pressure. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And I think a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation would be a good idea. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… a CT scan… a neurologist… Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I… I just want to understand what is happening. Whatever it takes. I… I trust your judgment. It feels… overwhelming, to be honest. But… I understand it is necessary. I… I just want my life back. Whatever it takes. Please, do what you think is best. It feels… important to be proactive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'm going to write up the orders for the blood work and CT scan now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can schedule the CT scan for you. I'll also get the referral to the neurologist sent over. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your stress levels as much as possible. Getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can all help improve cognitive function. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out to family or friends for support. I'm going to prescribe a low-dose blood pressure medication to start. It’s important to get your blood pressure under control, as high blood pressure can contribute to cognitive decline. I will also give you a list of resources for memory care and support groups. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A list of resources… That sounds… helpful, Doctor. Thank you. No, I do not… I do not think so, not at the moment. I am… overwhelmed, to be honest. Just… please, do everything you can. I… I just want to understand what is happening. And… I just want my life back. It feels… strange to be talking about all of this. It feels… like a nightmare. But… I trust you, Doctor. Please, do everything you can. And… thank you. For listening. And… for caring. It feels… important to be taken seriously. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I will do everything I can. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. My staff will help get you scheduled for the tests and follow up with you as soon as the results are available. Here are the prescriptions and the list of resources I mentioned. Take care of yourself, Ms. Alvara. And remember, you're not alone in this.
