DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Versace. It says here you’re 75 years old. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-five, though I sometimes forget what day it is, let alone the year. It’s… well, it’s a long story. But truthfully, I haven’t been myself lately. Just… low. Very low.
DOCTOR: “Low,” you say. Can you elaborate on that for me, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It's not a physical thing, Doctor. My body… it aches a little with age, naturally. But this is… inside. No joy in things. Everything feels… gray. Even things I used to love. I used to be quite the swimmer, you know. Lifeguarded for years. Now… I don’t even want to look at the water.
DOCTOR: So, a loss of interest in activities you previously enjoyed. And this has been going on for how long, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It didn’t happen overnight. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe six months now? Possibly longer. Time… it all blurs. I just noticed it getting worse, especially these last few weeks. I find myself just… sitting. Doing nothing.
DOCTOR: Six months, with a worsening trend in the last few weeks. Alright. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep or appetite during this time?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Both. I sleep… too much, sometimes. And other times, I just lie awake for hours. And my appetite… it’s just gone. I have to force myself to eat, and even then, it doesn't taste like anything. My daughter keeps bringing me food, bless her heart, but… it just sits in the refrigerator.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any difficulty with concentration, or perhaps any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… Oh, yes. A great deal of that. It feels like… what’s the point? Everything I’ve built, everything I’ve done… it doesn’t matter. And concentration… forget about it! I try to read, but the words just swim on the page. I used to be a very sharp woman, Doctor. A very sharp woman. Now… it’s like my brain is full of cotton.
DOCTOR: I see. Have you experienced any thoughts of harming yourself, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens, no. Never. I wouldn’t… I could never. But… the thought of just not being… that thought comes sometimes. But harming myself? No. Never that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. We're going to proceed with a thorough assessment. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, my knees are bad, naturally. Arthritis, the doctor says. And I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. That’s about it, really. I’ve been lucky, all things considered. Mostly just the aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and hypertension. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And… Amlodipine, too. Yes, those two. I take them every morning. Doctor told me not to stop, even if I feel unwell.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and Amlodipine, as you said. Any allergies to medications, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I’ve always been careful. My mother always said, "Better safe than sorry." She was a very sensible woman.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Now, Ms. Derasmo, let’s talk a little about your family history. Has anyone in your family suffered from depression or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she was a very stoic woman. Didn't talk about feelings much. But looking back… she was often very sad. Very withdrawn. I don’t know if they called it depression back then, but she struggled. My brother, too, he had… issues. He drank quite heavily. So, yes, I suppose there's a history of it.
DOCTOR: History of mood issues and substance abuse in family. Alright. And finally, Ms. Derasmo, can you tell me a little about your social situation?
PATIENT: Well… I’m divorced. Has been many years now. My daughter, she’s very good to me. Visits often, brings groceries. But she has her own life, you know? A husband, children. I don’t want to be a burden. I used to have many friends, but… people move away, get sick… It's just me, mostly. And the television.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Based on what you’ve told me, and given the duration of your symptoms, I suspect you may be suffering from major depressive disorder. However, we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I'm going to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level – just to be thorough.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I understand. I just… want to feel like myself again. When can I expect the results, Doctor? And… what happens then? I’m rather tired of feeling this way.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back in about a week. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If the results are normal, we can then explore treatment options, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. I also want to do a brief physical exam now, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your reflexes. That won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. Anything to get to the bottom of this. A week, you say? Very well. Let’s get it over with, then. I have… other things I’d rather be doing, but… I suppose this is necessary.
DOCTOR: If you'll just have a seat here, Ms. Derasmo. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… and try to take deep breaths. 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart… Regular rate and rhythm, but a slight murmur… likely benign, given your age. And lungs… Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Very well. My knees aren’t what they used to be, so be gentle, please. Oh, that’s a little uncomfortable. But… I suppose it has to be done. Is it… is it bad? I’m not very good with medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, nothing alarming. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing to be concerned about. Normal heart and lung sounds, diminished reflexes, blood pressure elevated. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask a few quick questions as part of a standardized depression screening tool. It’s just a series of yes or no questions. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please do. The sooner this is all over, the better. I'm ready, Doctor. Ask away. I'll answer as truthfully as I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. First question: Over the last two weeks, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Yes. Definitely yes. More days than not, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And over the last two weeks, have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Yes. That too. Everything feels… flat. Like looking at a gray wall. I used to love gardening, swimming… now, I can barely bring myself to watch television.
DOCTOR: Alright. Next question: Over the last two weeks, have you had trouble falling or staying asleep, or have you been sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Both, actually. Some nights I can’t sleep at all, just lie awake for hours. And other times… I sleep for ten, twelve hours straight and still feel exhausted. So… yes. Yes, definitely.
DOCTOR: And over the last two weeks, have you felt tired or had little energy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Every single day. Just… completely drained. It takes all my effort just to get out of bed. Yes, absolutely.
DOCTOR: Next question: Over the last two weeks, have you had a poor appetite or eaten too much?
PATIENT: My appetite is… gone. I have to force myself to eat. My daughter worries about me. So yes, a poor appetite. Definitely.
DOCTOR: And over the last two weeks, have you felt bad about yourself—or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone. I haven’t been much use lately. So… yes.
DOCTOR: And over the last two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?
PATIENT: Yes. My mind just… wanders. I try to read, but the words swim on the page. It’s very frustrating. Yes, definitely.
DOCTOR: One last question: Over the last two weeks, have you been moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?
PATIENT: Well… my daughter said I was a little slow the other day. I hadn’t noticed myself, but she did mention it. So… yes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Based on the results of this screening tool, and your reported symptoms, I am confident in a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. It is important to remember this is a treatable condition, and we have options available to help you feel better. We’ll start with the bloodwork to rule out other possible causes. Then, we can discuss therapy and medication. I will write you a prescription for a low dose antidepressant to start, and a referral to a therapist specializing in geriatric depression. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: Major… depressive disorder? That sounds… serious. So it’s not just me being old and… difficult? It's a real thing? A prescription… and therapy? That sounds like a lot. But… if it might help… I suppose I’m willing to try anything at this point. What… what kind of side effects can I expect from the medication? And… what will the therapy involve?
DOCTOR: It is a real thing, Ms. Derasmo, and it's very common, especially in individuals your age. It’s not a sign of weakness or personal failing; it’s a medical condition, like high blood pressure. It’s good you’re willing to try treatment. The medication I’m prescribing is an SSRI, called Sertraline. Common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and some mild insomnia. However, these are usually temporary and subside within a few weeks. It’s important to start with a low dose, as we discussed, and to report any concerning side effects to me immediately. As for therapy, I'm referring you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a specialist in cognitive behavioral therapy for older adults. It will involve talking through your feelings and identifying negative thought patterns that contribute to your depression. She will teach you coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your symptoms and improve your overall mood. Typically, sessions are 50 minutes long, once a week. Do you have any other questions before I write the prescriptions and referral?
PATIENT: Cognitive… behavioral therapy? That sounds… complicated. I’ve never done anything like that before. And what if it doesn't work? What if I just… can’t get better? I’m worried about taking medication, too. I’ve always been careful about what I put in my body. And… how long will it take to see a difference? I’m not sure I have the patience for a long process.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Derasmo. Cognitive behavioral therapy can seem daunting, but Dr. Vance is very skilled at working with older adults. It’s not about dwelling on the past; it’s about learning practical skills to manage your thoughts and feelings in the present. As for the medication, it’s important to remember it doesn’t work overnight. It typically takes 4-6 weeks to start seeing a noticeable difference, and it can take up to 12 weeks to reach full effect. It’s also important to be patient and consistent with both the medication and therapy. We'll monitor your progress closely, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It’s also important to remember that treatment is not a one-size-fits-all approach. If one treatment isn't working, we can explore other options. We are in this together, and I’m confident we can find a plan that works for you. I’m going to write the prescriptions for the Sertraline and the referral to Dr. Vance now. Do you have any allergies that I need to be aware of, or any other medical conditions that might impact your treatment?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Just the arthritis and the blood pressure, as we discussed. Very well. I suppose I have nothing to lose by trying. Write the prescriptions, Doctor. And… thank you. I appreciate your patience with me. I’m not used to talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Here are your prescriptions for Sertraline, a 30-day supply, and the referral to Dr. Vance. The referral form includes her contact information, and a brief overview of your medical history. Please call her office to schedule an appointment. The bloodwork order is already sent to the lab at Suburban Medical. You can go anytime today. I'm scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks, on August 30th, to discuss your progress and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any concerning side effects or have any urgent concerns. Do you understand everything?
PATIENT: August 30th… Yes, I think so. Four weeks. Dr. Vance… and the bloodwork. It's a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor Versace. I appreciate your help. I’ll call Dr. Vance’s office and schedule an appointment. And I’ll get the bloodwork done. I suppose… I suppose I should get going. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. Remember, I am here to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you on August 30th. .
