DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Doctor, is it? Good to meet you too. I… moved here. New place. Need a doctor, I think. Medicare… they said I need to come. Social thing, maybe? It’s all a bit of a… blur. Not feeling bad, you know. Just… new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. New places can be a bit overwhelming, and getting everything sorted with insurance and healthcare...it adds to it! It sounds like this visit is partly just to establish care and make sure you have a local doctor. That’s great. So, even though you’re not feeling bad right now, it’s good to get a baseline. Let's just talk through a bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. First, have you been seeing a doctor regularly before moving here?
PATIENT: Regularly? I… think so? Back home… maybe. Lots of waiting rooms. Old man always telling me what to do. Can't remember his name now. It was… a doctor. Yes. Definitely a doctor. Not recently, though. A long time ago. I mostly just… do my work. Makeup, you know? Performance things. That’s what I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, it’s been a while since you’ve had a check-up. That's alright – we can start fresh. You mentioned “performance things” and makeup… is that your profession?
PATIENT: Profession? Yes. The profession. Makeup artist. For… well, for important people. Theatre, mostly. And some… others. Very good at it, I am. Years of experience. Very demanding work, you know. All the lights and… the drama. Not like those little shop things. Real work. It keeps me busy. Though, not so much now. New place and all.
DOCTOR: That sounds fascinating, and very skilled work! It is demanding, I can imagine. All those long hours and being on your feet… Let's talk a little bit about your health in general. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? No. Not really. Little coughs, maybe. Old age things. Surgeries… hmm. I think… maybe a bad tooth, long ago. Very small thing. They fixed it. That’s all I remember. Nothing important. I don’t get sick. Good constitution, I have. Strong Russian blood, you know. We don't do sick. Though, sometimes… my back. A little ache. From the work. The leaning, always leaning. But nothing a little rub won’t fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, with a history of just a tooth extraction and some occasional back pain. That’s good to hear. And you said the back pain is just from leaning over during work?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Exactly. The leaning. And the… the people. They move, you know? Always shifting. You have to adjust. Very tiring. I have to… hold things just right. Very precise work. My back gets… stiff. Sometimes I need… someone to help. Not often. But sometimes. It’s just… part of the job. Not a big deal. Old age, too, probably. Everything aches a little when you get older. You wouldn't understand. Young people… always so energetic. No aches!
DOCTOR: I understand completely – it sounds like your work is very physically demanding, and it makes sense that it would take a toll on your back. We can definitely talk more about that and ways to manage the pain. Now, let’s just go through some basic things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. No… I don't think so. Never had problems. I eat… everything. Russian food is… strong. Lots of things in it. Garlic, onions, pickles… Everything. Never reacted to anything. Maybe… dust? Sometimes my nose itches. But that's just… dust. Not an allergy. I don't do allergies. Weak people get allergies. I’m a strong Russian man. No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh. I take… nothing. Rarely. Maybe… a little something for a headache, long ago. From the stress, you know? The drama. But nothing regular. I don’t like pills. Bad for you, they are. Full of chemicals. I prefer… strong tea. That fixes everything. And… maybe a little vodka sometimes. For the nerves. But that’s not… a medication. Not really. No. I don't take medications. Healthy Russian man. Remember? We don't need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally you don't take any regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any family history of any major medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, now you're asking about family. That's… complicated. Back home, everyone is… old. They all… have things. Old age things. My Baba… she had a bad hip. And my Uncle Dimitri… he drank too much vodka and… well, you know. Something with his stomach. And my cousin Svetlana… she worried a lot, and… something with her heart, maybe? It's all a blur. Everyone is old and… complaining. It's very depressing, honestly. I don't pay attention to their… things. I’m trying to live a healthy life, you know? Not like them. So… no. I don't have a family history. I make my own history. A healthy one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a bit of a complicated family history with some general health problems in older relatives, but you're focusing on staying healthy yourself. That’s a great attitude. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke?! No! Never. Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. Bad for you, very bad. I have… lungs. I need them for… breathing. For my work. Holding my breath, you know? Precise work. Can't smoke. I used to see people smoke, back home. Filthy habit. Makes you cough, makes you smell bad. No. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. A strong Russian man does not need such things. Never.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very good. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well… sometimes. A little. For… celebration. Or… nerves. It’s… Russian custom, you know? A little vodka. It’s good for… the soul. Not every day. Maybe… a shot or two. On special occasions. And… sometimes when I’m stressed. It’s not a problem, you understand? I’m a strong Russian man. I can handle my vodka. Just a little. It’s good for… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little vodka occasionally for celebration or stress. We'll make a note of that. Now, I’m just going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Must we? I’m not feeling bad, you know. But… alright. If you must. Just be gentle. I’m a delicate artist, you understand? All these years of precise work… I have sensitive… everything. And don't poke too much. Just listen. And be quick about it. I have… things to do. Very important things. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. Just relax. Okay, blood pressure is a little bit high today, 140 over 90. That can happen with stress, or sometimes just from being in a doctor's office. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs sound clear, but a little bit quiet. Have you had any coughs or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: Quiet? What do you mean, quiet? I’m breathing, aren’t I? No coughs. Never cough. Strong Russian lungs. And… fast heart? I'm a passionate man! I get excited easily. It’s the drama, you know? All the lights and… the people. It gets the heart racing. Don’t worry about it. Everything is fine. It’s just… me. A vibrant, passionate man. Everything is perfectly normal. For a Russian man, anyway.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s good to be passionate! Your abdomen feels soft, and doesn't seem to be causing you any pain. Your pulses feel strong. Okay, everything seems generally okay. I'd like to order a basic blood panel, just to get a baseline and check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar. It will also help us see if your blood pressure is consistently high. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood panel? More poking and prodding? I don't like needles. Bad memories. Back home… But… alright. If you insist. Must we have so many tests? It’s all very… disruptive. But just quickly, please. And be gentle. Very gentle. And don’t tell me about everything. I don’t want to know the details. Just tell me if something is… wrong. Quickly, please. I have… important things to do. Very important things.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll make sure it's as quick and comfortable as possible. And I’ll only tell you what you need to know. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw the blood. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend that you try to reduce your stress levels and get regular exercise. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. And try to limit your alcohol intake. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I think… I’m overwhelmed. Too much information. Too many tests. Too much poking and prodding. Just… fix me. Make sure I’m healthy. And then I can get back to my life. My important life. No questions. Just fix me. Quickly. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We will do our best to make sure you’re healthy. The blood work will give us a good starting point, and then we can discuss any further steps. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. Please let me know if you have any concerns at any time. Thank you for coming in today, Kile.
