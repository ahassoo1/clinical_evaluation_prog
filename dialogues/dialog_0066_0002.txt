DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Condray, you say? That’s a nice name. Hmm… what brought me in… let me think. It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not painful, just… hard to go. It takes a long time, and sometimes… well, sometimes it doesn’t come at all. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Zoie. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: When did it start… oh dear. That’s a hard one. It feels like… a while now. Not suddenly, not like a shock. Just… slowly getting harder over… weeks? Maybe months? It’s hard to say. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I’m old! Is that helpful, doctor? I don’t even remember when I noticed it first, just that it’s been getting worse.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It’s very common for things to develop gradually, and it’s understandable that it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. So, over the past few weeks or months, you’ve noticed increasing difficulty starting your urine stream, and it takes longer to empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! Longer to empty… yes. And sometimes… …sometimes I feel like it doesn’t empty all the way. Like there’s still a little bit left in there. It’s not much, but… it’s uncomfortable. And then I have to try again later. Does that make sense? I don’t want to bother you with all this old-lady stuff!
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Zoie, you're not bothering me one bit. This is important, and I'm glad you're telling me about it. Feeling like you’re not emptying your bladder completely is definitely something we need to look into. Do you find yourself needing to urinate more frequently than usual, or do you have any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go right away?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. Not really urgency, no. It’s not like I have to rush. More just… I go about the same amount of times, I think. Maybe a little more, now that I’m trying harder to get it all out. But it’s not like a sudden feeling, like I’ll… well, you know. No, not that. Just… more effort for the same number of trips. And sometimes I have to go back a little while later, like I said. Is that…clear? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're explaining everything very clearly, Zoie. No rambling at all! So, no sudden urge, but perhaps a little more effort and the need to go back again shortly after. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not stinging… nothing like that. Just… weak. It feels weak, like the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be. That's probably why it takes so long, and why I feel like I don't get it all out. It's not uncomfortable uncomfortable, just… frustrating. And tiring, a little. Old age, I suppose. Everything takes more effort these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. No pain or burning, just a weak stream, taking longer to empty, and sometimes feeling like you don’t empty completely. To get a complete picture, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… let me think. My husband, bless his soul, he had the blood pressure. I think I had a little bit of that too, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill for it, but I don’t take it anymore. I think it went away. And… oh, I had a little trouble with my waterworks when I was younger, after the babies. But that was a long time ago. They said it was… something with the bladder, but I don’t remember the name of it. It got better on its own. Does that help? I’m terrible with remembering names and dates, I always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, that's helpful. So, you had a history of high blood pressure in the past, which resolved, and some bladder issues after having children, which also resolved. I want to ask about surgeries. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was scary! And… oh, and a gallbladder, I think. Yes, gallbladder. A long time ago. And… I had a baby, three babies, actually. Were those surgeries? My husband always said they were the bravest things I ever did. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No broken bones or anything like that. Is that what you wanted to know? It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. Tonsils out as a child, gallbladder surgery, and three vaginal deliveries. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just this one. It’s for my… well, it’s for my bones. The doctor said I was getting a little weak. Something about calcium, I think. Just one a day. And sometimes I take a little vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on, but that’s it. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, you know. Mostly just good food and a little bit of walking when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, so you take calcium daily and occasionally vitamin C. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies, thank goodness. My husband, bless his soul, he was always sneezing. I always felt bad for him. But me? Never had any trouble. Just good luck, I suppose. Is that all the questions you have, doctor? I feel like I'm taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, Zoie, you're not taking up too much of my time at all. It’s important to get a complete picture. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to do a brief abdominal exam and, if you're comfortable, a quick check of your bladder. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure, pulse… that sounds fine. I don’t mind a little listening, either. But the bladder… what does that involve, doctor? I’m a little nervous, I admit. Is it… painful? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. I’m an old lady, my skin is sensitive. Just tell me what you’re going to do, so I don't get startled.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I understand your concerns. The bladder exam is very gentle. I’ll just feel your lower abdomen to assess the size and shape of your bladder. I may also gently tap the area to listen for any changes in sound, which can help us understand how well your bladder is emptying. It shouldn’t be painful, but please tell me immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. We can stop at any time. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… less scary, when you explain it like that. Just feeling and tapping… alright. Yes, that’s fine. As long as it’s gentle. You’re very kind, doctor. It’s nice to have someone explain things so clearly. My husband always liked a doctor who explained things. Alright, let’s get it over with. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me if it’s going to hurt before you do it, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I will be very gentle, and I'll explain everything as I go. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated but not overly concerning for your age. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, if you could lie back on the examination table, I'll listen to your abdomen. Okay, Zoie, I'm just feeling your abdomen now. I’m not feeling any obvious masses or tenderness. Your bladder feels… slightly full. I’m also tapping gently to listen for any changes in sound. I’m hearing a slight dullness, which is consistent with a partially full bladder. It doesn't indicate anything serious, but it suggests you may not be emptying completely as you mentioned. Alright, Zoie, everything seems normal on the physical exam, but the slight dullness over your bladder does confirm what you've been telling me about difficulty emptying. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a simple urine test to check for infection and a postvoid residual volume test. That involves measuring the amount of urine left in your bladder after you empty it. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot of tests! But if it helps… alright. A urine test and… measuring what’s left. Yes, that’s fine. What about the measuring… is that painful, too? I don’t want to get poked and prodded. It's good you explain everything, doctor. It makes me feel better. My husband always said a good doctor is a good explainer. So, if it’s not too painful… yes, alright. Let's do the tests. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure everything is as comfortable as possible. The postvoid residual volume test is very straightforward and shouldn’t be painful. We’ll have you urinate into a container, and then I’ll use a small, sterile catheter—a very thin, flexible tube—to gently drain a small amount of urine from your bladder to measure the remaining volume. It may feel a little strange, like you need to urinate, but it shouldn’t hurt. I’ll explain every step as I go, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. The urine test is just a simple sample, collected in a cup. I’ll have the nurse come in to collect those samples now. While we're waiting for the results, which should be available within a few days, I’m going to recommend some simple measures you can try at home. Would you like me to explain those now?
PATIENT: Oh, a nurse, too? Alright. Yes, explain the things I can do at home. That sounds… less scary than all the poking and prodding. I always liked things I could do myself. Less trouble for everyone. What are these things, doctor? Are they hard? I’m an old lady, my bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: They’re very simple, Zoie, and not difficult at all. The first thing is timed voiding. That means trying to urinate every 2-3 hours, even if you don’t feel a strong urge. This helps train your bladder to empty more completely. The second is double voiding—urinating, waiting a few minutes, and then trying to urinate again. This can help ensure you’ve emptied everything. Finally, I recommend pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder, which can improve control. I can show you how to do those. Would you like me to explain any of those in more detail, or would you like the nurse to come in and demonstrate?
PATIENT: Oh, timed voiding… that sounds sensible. Like a schedule. I always liked a good schedule. Double voiding… that sounds a bit silly, but alright. If it helps. And the muscle exercises… those sound hard. I’m not very good at exercises. Show me, maybe? If it’s not too much trouble. I’d rather see someone do it than try to figure it out myself. My husband always said I was better at watching than doing. Yes, show me the muscle exercises, if you don’t mind. And then, maybe, the nurse can come in? Is that alright? I’m a little tired now, all this talking and thinking.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. No trouble at all. Let’s start with the Kegel exercises. They’re very simple, and you can do them anywhere. Imagine you’re trying to stop the flow of urine midstream – that’s the muscles you want to focus on. Squeeze those muscles tightly for 5 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds. Repeat that 10-15 times, several times a day. You don't need to do this while actually urinating – just practice the squeezing motion. It's important to breathe normally while you’re doing them – don’t hold your breath. It’s okay if you don’t feel a strong squeeze at first – it takes practice to identify the right muscles. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, squeezing… like stopping the flow? Yes, I think I understand. It feels… strange. Am I doing it right? It doesn't feel like much. And I have to be careful, don't want to… Maybe I'm not very good at this. My husband always said I wasn’t very coordinated. Does it matter if I can’t squeeze very tightly? Should I feel something when I do it? It's all a little confusing. Maybe I should just stick to the schedule, the timed voiding. That seems easier.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsure at first, Zoie. It takes time to identify the right muscles, and everyone’s different. It doesn’t matter if you can’t squeeze very tightly – any contraction is good. You shouldn’t feel any pain or discomfort – just a gentle squeeze. And you're right, the timed voiding is a great place to start. We can focus on that for now. I’ll have the nurse come in to collect a urine sample, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the postvoid residual volume test. After we have those results, we can discuss them and adjust our plan if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. No more squeezing for now. Just the schedule and the test. The nurse can come in whenever she’s ready. I’m a little tired now, all this thinking and trying. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very kind. My husband always said a good doctor is patient and explains things clearly. You’ve been very patient with me. Just let me know when the nurse is coming, and I’ll do the test.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. I’m happy to help. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready. In the meantime, try not to worry. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll be back in a few minutes to discuss the next steps.
