DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Well, to be blunt, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, constantly hungry, even after I’ve eaten a good meal. It’s… quite bothersome, actually.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… yes. And how long has this “constant” thirst and hunger been occurring, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been going on for, oh, perhaps the last month or so? It started gradually, I suppose. Just feeling a bit more parched than usual, needing a snack here and there. But it’s gotten steadily worse, to the point where I’m drinking quite a bit more water than normal and still feeling thirsty, and eating… well, quite a lot more food.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And have you noticed any other changes alongside this increased thirst and appetite?
PATIENT: Changes… that’s a good question. Not that I’ve actively been looking for any, to be honest. Now that you mention it, I think I’ve been going to the lavatory more often than usual. And… perhaps a little more tired than I normally am, but I put that down to the weather, frankly. It's been awfully warm.
DOCTOR: Increased urination and some fatigue… very well. And are you experiencing any visual disturbances, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Visual disturbances? No, not that I’m aware of. My eyesight’s not the best, always has been a bit blurry, but it hasn’t gotten any worse recently, if that’s what you mean. I had my eyes checked last year, everything was… satisfactory, I believe the optometrist said. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient for now. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, that sort of thing. I broke my arm when I was a lad, playing football. And I had my appendix out when I was in my early twenties, but that’s about it. No ongoing conditions, no, sir. Is there something in particular you're looking for? I'm rather pressed for time this afternoon, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any family history of diabetes, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother’s side of the family… my grandmother, I believe, had something along those lines. Not entirely sure what, to be honest. She was… quite old when she passed, and my mother never really talked about it much. My father’s side, no. As far as I know, perfectly healthy bunch. Does that help? I’m afraid my knowledge of family medical history isn’t particularly comprehensive.
DOCTOR: Adequate. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can, honestly. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, that's all. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I believe in keeping things… natural, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Alright. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me, Mr. Erxleben.
PATIENT: Right, yes. Of course. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything. I haven’t weighed myself in quite some time.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms… and your height is 170 centimeters, as recorded. That places your Body Mass Index at 32.3. Which is… significant. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Alright. 32.3, you say? That doesn’t sound particularly… good, does it? I’ve always been a bit… stocky, I suppose. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. I’m just eager to find out what’s causing all this thirst and hunger, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Now, I'd like to quickly check your urine. I'll leave you a container. Please collect a sample for me when you're able. We'll send it off for analysis.
PATIENT: Right, yes. A urine sample. Of course. I’ll… endeavour to provide a suitable specimen as soon as possible. Is there anywhere specific you'd like me to… deposit it? I don’t want to leave it lying around. And… what sort of timeframe are we looking at for the results? I have commitments this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: The restroom is just through there. Leave the sample on the designated shelf. The laboratory typically provides results within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my assistant contact you. For now, based on the limited information and initial findings, I suspect possible Type 2 diabetes. However, we must confirm with the urine analysis and a blood glucose test. I'll order a fasting blood glucose test for you as well.
PATIENT: Diabetes… I suspected as much, frankly. My grandmother, you see. Alright. Fasting blood glucose test. Is that something I can do at home, or will I need to come back here? And... are there any immediate lifestyle changes you'd recommend in the meantime? Besides, you know, drinking less and eating less, which seems rather obvious. I’m trying to be proactive here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’ll need to return to the clinic tomorrow morning, having fasted overnight. No food or sugary drinks after midnight. As for immediate lifestyle adjustments… reduce your intake of sugary beverages and refined carbohydrates. Increase your consumption of vegetables and lean protein. And try to engage in moderate physical activity, if your health permits. But do not self-treat, Mr. Erxleben. We need accurate diagnostics before making any definitive recommendations. My assistant will schedule the blood test and provide further instructions. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Alright. Tomorrow morning, fasted. No sugar, more vegetables. I can manage that. I think… no, I believe that covers everything for the moment. I’ll await your assistant’s call. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll see you tomorrow then.
