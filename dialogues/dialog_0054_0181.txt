DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Dashevsky. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I believe I filled out the paperwork, but feel free to ask me anything at all.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun – very wise to be proactive about your health. Yes, I see your paperwork here. Thank you for completing that. It gives me a good starting point. Before we get started, can you confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is November 14th, 1951. I remember it clearly – a Tuesday, if I recall correctly. My wife, Elena, always jokes I’ve a better memory for dates than for where I put my tools.
DOCTOR: November 14th, 1951. Noted. And Elena sounds like a lovely woman. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully, not much to report on that front, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. As an adult… let me think. I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while building a roof, perhaps fifteen years ago. It healed well, thankfully, and caused no lasting trouble. Other than that, just the occasional flu, I suppose. Nothing that required a stay in hospital, no. I've always been a fairly robust fellow, if I may say so myself.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A broken wrist aside, a relatively clean medical history. And you mentioned the flu – do you typically get a flu shot each year?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. Elena insists upon it. She’s quite diligent about these things, a very practical woman. I get it every autumn, usually at the pharmacy down the street. I can't say I enjoy it, but I understand the importance. And, truthfully, she’d make my life rather difficult if I refused.
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful that Elena is so proactive about your health, and that you listen to her! It really is important. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve managed to avoid the operating table thus far, thankfully. I always say, a good carpenter avoids needing repairs, and that applies to the body as well!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. No surgeries is a good thing. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me see… my father, he had some trouble with his heart in his later years, I believe. It wasn’t diagnosed precisely, back in Venezuela things were… less thorough, shall we say? He just slowed down, became weaker. My mother, she lived to a very good age, though she did suffer from arthritis in her knees. Elena’s family… her father had diabetes, I believe, and her sister, she had breast cancer, some years ago now. She recovered well, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Mombrun. That gives me a good starting point. Heart issues on your father's side, arthritis in your mother's, and diabetes and cancer in Elena’s family. We’ll want to keep those in mind. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m a construction laborer, as you know. So, I’m quite physically active, even at my age. I enjoy working with my hands, building things. It keeps me busy, keeps me feeling useful. I don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps two, but nothing excessive. And I try to eat a healthy diet – Elena is very particular about that as well, lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. We grow some of our own, in the garden.
DOCTOR: That sounds very good, Mr. Mombrun – very healthy habits. It's wonderful that you stay so active and enjoy gardening. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, as far as I know. I can take most medications without issue. Elena sometimes worries, she's a cautious woman, but I've never given her cause for concern in that regard.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. No known allergies is good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, if my knees are acting up after a long day on the job, I’ll take an ibuprofen, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, nothing I take every day. I prefer to manage things naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Mombrun. That’s a very thorough overview of your medical history. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general appearance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment. I understand these things are necessary. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you need me to relax my arm or anything of the sort. I'm quite accustomed to physical work, so I suppose my muscles might be a bit… firm.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Mombrun. Your muscles are quite normal for someone with your occupation. Just try to relax as much as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Your heart rate is 78 and regular. Sounds good. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I try to breathe deeply every day, Elena encourages it. She says it's good for the soul, as well as the body. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun, that's perfect. Your breath sounds are clear and equal bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or other abnormalities detected. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort.
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. I sometimes get a little indigestion after a rich meal, but nothing of any great concern. Other than that, it should be… unremarkable.
DOCTOR: Everything feels normal here, Mr. Mombrun. No tenderness, no masses. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I used to have rather quick reflexes, playing baseball as a young man, but I suppose they've slowed down a bit with age.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age. Everything appears within acceptable limits. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that concludes the physical exam. Overall, everything looks good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can monitor that and discuss lifestyle modifications if needed. Given your age and family history, I would recommend a few basic blood tests to get a baseline and screen for any potential issues. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests seem a prudent precaution. I trust your judgment entirely. I'm quite happy to proceed with whatever you deem necessary. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good overview of your overall health. The lab results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d recommend continuing your healthy lifestyle habits - staying active, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking. We can discuss your blood pressure in more detail once we have the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. You've put my mind at ease, truthfully. I appreciate your careful examination and clear explanations. I'll continue with my current routine and await the results with anticipation. Thank you for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and stay healthy.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. I’m most grateful for your excellent care. I shall await the results and will see you again shortly. Goodbye to you as well, and have a pleasant day. .
