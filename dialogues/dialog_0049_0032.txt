DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a rather delicate matter, you understand. One doesn’t simply discuss these things with just anyone. It’s… a bit of a leak, shall we say? Down there. It’s been…present. For a while now. Though, to be honest, time seems to slip away these days, doesn't it? I can't quite recall when it started, precisely. It’s just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "A leak," you say. Right. And is this a constant issue, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant…no, not constant. It ebbs and flows, like the tide, you might say. Though I haven't been near the sea in… decades. Mostly, it’s noticeable after… well, after being intimate with my wife, Zahra. And sometimes, just… randomly. It's not painful, exactly, but it's… worrying. It's not a dignified thing, you understand. A man shouldn't have to be discussing this with a… with a woman doctor. Though, I suppose, needs must.
DOCTOR: So, it’s more pronounced after sexual activity. And you said “randomly” – can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes, well. It's difficult to pinpoint, you see. Sometimes, when I'm… gardening. Or after a particularly long spell of sitting. It's just… a dampness. A slight… discharge. It's not a great amount, mind you. But it's there. It stains my undergarments. And I do pride myself on a neat appearance. Zahra… she doesn’t complain, but I can see it bothers her when doing the laundry. Honestly, it's terribly inconvenient. I haven't a clue what could be causing it. Perhaps it's the heat? This summer has been brutal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. No… no burning, no pain, as I said. No fever. Though my joints ache sometimes, but that’s just old age, I expect. And… no, nothing else comes to mind immediately. Zahra has mentioned a… a slight odor, occasionally. But honestly, the woman has a very sensitive nose. She can smell a dandelion a mile away. It could be my imagination, or hers. I suppose I haven't really looked… down there, if you understand what I mean. It's not something a gentleman does. It’s rather…undignified, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to do a quick examination to get a better idea of what’s going on. It's a standard procedure, Mr. Krok, and entirely necessary to determine the cause of the discharge and rule out any potential issues. I have a chaperone available if you'd prefer. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A… an examination? Oh dear. Well, I… I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? A necessary evil, as they say. A chaperone… yes, perhaps. That would be… preferable. I'm not a young man anymore, you understand. And… well, it's rather personal. Though, I trust you’re a professional, Doctor. One expects a certain… discretion. And please, be quick about it. This is all rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Completely understandable. I'll have Nurse Elara come in. She'll be with you in just a moment. While we wait, can you tell me about any past medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Past conditions… hmm. Well, I had a touch of the flu, years ago. And my prostate… the doctor mentioned it was enlarged, some time back. He prescribed some pills, but I stopped taking them. They gave me… unpleasant side effects. And my knees, as I said, ache terribly. Arthritis, the doctor called it. And… Zahra handles all the paperwork, you see. I haven't the foggiest idea what else. I've always been a relatively healthy man, all things considered. Farm work keeps you fit, you know. Though, it's not what it used to be. Now, is this Nurse Elara likely to be…discreet? It’s important. A man’s reputation, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nurse Elara is very discreet. She’s been with the clinic for a long time and is quite experienced. Now, regarding the prostate enlargement - do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Medication… oh dear. The name… it escapes me. It was a small, white pill, I believe. Perhaps oblong? Zahra would know, but she’s… at the market. Buying tomatoes, most likely. She’s very particular about her tomatoes. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest clue. I just remember it didn't agree with me. Made me feel… unwell. And I stopped taking it. It was years ago, you understand. A very long time ago. Are we absolutely certain we need to dwell on this? It’s all rather… embarrassing. I simply want this…leak…to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's proceed with the examination. Nurse Elara should be here any moment. It will allow me to assess the situation and determine the best course of action. Please lie on the examination table, and we'll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been quite robust, as a rule. Though, I get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season. But that’s just…seasonal. Nothing serious. And I once had a rather nasty reaction to a bee sting, years ago. But that was when I was a boy, practically. A very long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not fond of examinations. It’s… unmanly, you see. A gentleman shouldn’t have to… well, you understand. Just please be quick about it, and try to be…gentle. This is all rather distressing. And could you perhaps explain what you’re doing as you go? I’m not a medical man, you see. I don't understand all these… procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I understand your discomfort. I’ll explain everything as we go, and we'll proceed as quickly and gently as possible. Nurse Elara will be here momentarily. She will assist me with the examination. It will involve a brief physical assessment and possibly a urine sample to help determine the cause of the discharge. We may need to refer you to a specialist for further testing, depending on what we find. Now, if you could just lie on the table…
PATIENT: A specialist… oh dear. More doctors. More examinations. Honestly, this is becoming quite… onerous. A urine sample, you say? Is there any particular…position I should adopt? And please, do try to be discreet. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. And Zahra… well, she would be most displeased to hear of all this fuss. Just get it over with quickly, Doctor. I haven’t much patience for medical procedures, and frankly, I'm rather cold. This room is drafty, you see. Is there a blanket available?
DOCTOR: Yes, there's a blanket. Nurse Elara will assist you with obtaining a urine sample. It’s a simple procedure. She’ll provide you with a sterile container and instructions. And as for the specialist, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let's focus on the examination and try to gather some information. Nurse Elara, if you would.
PATIENT: A nurse… yes. Well, I suppose this is unavoidable. Please, be gentle. And try not to… stare. It’s rather embarrassing, you see. A gentleman shouldn’t be subjected to… scrutiny. This is all very distressing. And do explain what you're doing, Nurse. I'm not familiar with these… procedures. Zahra handles all these things, you understand. I simply came because… well, because of the leak. A rather… persistent leak. And it stains my undergarments. It’s terribly inconvenient. Honestly, I feel like a schoolboy again. This is most… undignified.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Nurse Elara. Dr. Nestingen will be explaining everything as we go. We just need a quick urine sample to start with. I’ll give you a container and some instructions, and then we’ll give you a moment of privacy. It's a simple test, and nothing to be concerned about. We'll ensure your comfort and dignity throughout the process. Here's the container…Just collect a mid-stream sample, if you could. Let me know if you have any questions. Dr. Nestingen will be right with you.
PATIENT: A mid-stream sample… yes. I suppose I understand. Though, it’s all rather… awkward, isn’t it? A gentleman shouldn’t be… performing these functions on command. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Zahra would be most displeased. She always says a man should have some privacy. Mid-stream… yes. I think I remember something about that from… well, from somewhere. It’s been a long time. Honestly, this is most…uncomfortable. Perhaps I should have stayed home and suffered in silence. This is far more distressing than the leak itself.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll give Mr. Krok some time. Hopefully, he'll be back shortly. Honestly, some patients…
PATIENT: There. It's done. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a complete schoolboy again. The indignity of it all is… quite shocking. And it's cold in there. A drafty restroom is most…uncomfortable. Now, can we please get this over with? I have gardening to do, you know. And Zahra will be wondering where I am. Honestly, I'm not fond of medical procedures. They’re… most undignified. Can we please proceed, Doctor? And quickly, if you please? This is most… distressing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed. If you could lie on the examination table, please. I’m going to perform a brief physical exam. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a quick external examination. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it's necessary to assess the situation. Nurse Elara will assist me if needed. Now, please remove your trousers and undergarments…I’ll provide you with a sheet for privacy.
PATIENT: Remove my… trousers? Oh dear. This is becoming increasingly…undignified. I haven’t been subjected to such scrutiny since… well, since childhood, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, this is most… distressing. Must we? Is there absolutely no alternative? I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A man of standing in the community doesn't simply… disrobe for anyone. And Nurse Elara… well, it’s most… awkward. Honestly, I feel like a complete fool. And it's cold! This room is positively glacial. Can we at least turn up the heat? Please, Doctor, consider my dignity. This is most…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, a physical examination is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. I understand your discomfort, but I assure you, this is a professional setting. I and the nurse are highly trained medical professionals. We are not interested in anything other than providing you with the best possible care. A proper diagnosis requires a visual inspection and palpation. I will be as quick and discreet as possible. If you continue to resist, I'm afraid I won’t be able to assist you. Now, if you could please proceed…
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all… A man of standing… subjected to such scrutiny… It’s simply appalling… Zahra will never believe this… Please, be quick about it, Doctor. And try not to…stare. It’s most…uncomfortable. And cold! This room is positively frigid. Honestly, this is worse than the leak itself. Just get it over with, Doctor. Please. Just get it over with…
DOCTOR: Alright. I've palpated your abdomen and performed a quick external examination. There's mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no obvious masses. The external genitalia appear normal, although there is some slight redness. We'll need to send the urine sample to the lab for analysis to rule out any infection. It will take a few days to get the results. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count and a Urinalysis. Nurse Elara will assist you in getting dressed. We'll discuss the results when they are available.
PATIENT: Infection… you say? Oh dear. Is it… serious? Zahra will be most worried. She always said I should have stayed home and rested. Honestly, this whole ordeal has been most… distressing. And cold! This room is positively glacial. Can we at least have a blanket? And perhaps a cup of tea? I feel quite… shaken. Honestly, this has been most…undignified. Just let me know when I can leave, please. And please, be quick about it. I have gardening to do, you know. And Zahra will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: We’ll have the results in a few days, Mr. Krok. It's likely nothing serious, but it's important to rule out any infection. Nurse Elara will provide you with some information on possible causes and symptoms to watch out for. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Tea… yes. Thank you, Nurse. That’s… most kind. Honestly, this has been most… distressing. And cold! This room is positively glacial. Possible causes… you say? Oh dear. What possible causes could there be? Is it… something serious? Zahra will be most worried. She always said I shouldn't have bothered coming to the doctor. Just tell me… will I be alright? Will I be able to… garden again? Honestly, this has been most…undignified. Please, just let me know when I can leave. I have gardening to do, you know. And Zahra will be wondering where I am. .
DOCTOR: It's likely a simple urinary tract infection, Mr. Krok, which is easily treatable with antibiotics. However, we need to confirm with the lab results. There are other possibilities, but we won't jump to conclusions until we have those results. This pamphlet outlines some common causes and symptoms to watch out for. And as for gardening, I'm sure you'll be back to it in no time. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week. I'm sure Dr. Nestingen will be able to provide you with more information then. For now, just try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact the clinic immediately.
