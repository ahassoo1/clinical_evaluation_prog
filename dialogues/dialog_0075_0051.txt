DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Let me see... what brings me in… Oh dear, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about… blood? My daughter, she said I should come and get it checked. Something about knowing my… type. Yes, that’s it! Blood type. I just need to know what it is, you see. For… reasons. Important reasons, I think. Though I can't rightly recall what they are right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood type. That’s perfectly reasonable, Darl. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. We can certainly determine that for you. Just to be thorough, and to help me understand the situation a little better, has anything specific prompted this request recently?
PATIENT: Oh, recently… Hmm. Now that you mention it… there was a bit of a… commotion. A fall, I believe. Not my fall, mind you! A neighbor’s boy, a lovely lad, tripped and… well, there was blood. And everyone was talking about types and matching… Oh, goodness, it’s all a bit hazy. I think my daughter was worried, just in case… you know. Just in case anything happened. She’s a very practical girl, that one. Is that helpful, dear? I hope I’m not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Darl, you’re perfectly clear. That gives me a much better understanding. It sounds like this was prompted by a recent event and your daughter is being appropriately cautious. So, just to confirm, you weren’t personally injured in this incident?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, not me! I was just… watching. From the porch, you see. A lovely afternoon it was, until… well, until the commotion. Poor boy. Scraped his knee quite badly, I think. My daughter, she fussed over him something awful. She’s got a good heart, that girl. But no, I wasn’t hurt. Just… a bit shaken, perhaps. Old bones, you know. They feel everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly natural to be shaken by something like that, even if you weren’t directly involved. Alright, so we’re going to focus on determining your blood type today. Before we proceed with a blood draw, I’d like to ask a few routine questions, if that’s alright. It helps me get a complete picture of your overall health. We'll start with any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, anything at all.
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I don’t think I have any. Not that I’m aware of. I used to get a bit of a rash with certain soaps, years ago, but that was… goodness, ages and ages ago. We don’t use those soaps anymore. And I can eat anything, pretty much. Unless it’s gone bad, of course! But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just common sense. No, I don't think I have any allergies, dear. Nothing serious, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me think. Just a little something for my… what is it for again? Oh dear… for my water retention. Yes, that’s it! My ankles swell up sometimes, you see. Just a tiny pill, once a day. It's… white, I think. A small, white pill. My doctor back in… well, back where I used to live, he gave it to me. That was… a long time ago. I can’t recall the name of it, though. I just keep taking it. It seems to help.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small white pill for water retention, taken daily. We'll try to get the name of that later, just to be safe. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Dosage? I haven’t the faintest idea. I just take one every morning with my tea. That’s what the doctor told me, years ago. “One with your tea,” he said. A very kind man, he was. But I never did pay much attention to numbers. They always muddled my head. I just trust my daughter to refill the bottle when it’s empty. She’s very good at these things. Do you need to know what the bottle looks like? I might be able to describe that.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Darl. We can likely figure it out from your pharmacy records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago! And… oh, yes! I broke my wrist once, falling off a horse. That was… quite the adventure! I was very young, mind you. And… and I had a baby, of course! That involved a hospital stay. But other than that… I don't think so. No, I can’t recall any other surgeries. Just the tonsils, the wrist, and the baby. A long time ago, all of them. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy, broken wrist, and childbirth. Nothing recent. Do you have any significant medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, significant medical conditions… Well, my knees ache something awful, especially in the winter. My daughter says it's arthritis, but I just thought it was old age! And… and my doctor used to say I had a touch of high blood pressure, years ago. But he put me on a pill for that too. I think. It’s all a bit… hazy, dear. I don’t really feel sick, you know? Just… old. And achy. I try to keep moving, that’s what my daughter tells me. It’s good for the circulation, she says. But no, I don't think I have any significant conditions. Just the aches and pains of getting older. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Darl. Aches and pains, some history of high blood pressure. We'll check your blood pressure today. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my daughter, Elena, is my only family left now. My husband, bless his soul, passed away many years ago. He was a fisherman, a strong man. And I had a brother, but he… he moved to America when we were young. I haven't seen him in ages. I don’t even know if he’s still alive. My daughter, she keeps in touch with everyone. She's very good at that. As far as I know, no one else in my family had any… serious illnesses. Just the usual aches and pains. Old age, you know? It gets to everyone eventually. Is that what you were asking about, dear? Family illnesses?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I was asking. And finally, have you ever smoked, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, smoked? Goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he used to smoke a pipe, but I always made him go outside. Dreadful habit, I thought. And drink… well, I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, back when my husband was alive. Just a small glass, to help with digestion, you see. But I haven't had a drink in years. Not since he passed away. It didn't seem right, somehow. So no, I don't smoke and I hardly ever drink anymore. Just a bit of water with my tea, that’s all. Is that alright, dear? I hope I'm not bothering you with all these memories. They come and go, you know. It's a bit like trying to catch smoke.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Darl. This is all very helpful information. It sounds like you have a healthy lifestyle overall. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I get a bit… fidgety, you see. Old bones, they don’t like being poked and prodded. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. I trust you, dear. Just be gentle, if you would. And perhaps you could tell me your name again? My memory, you see… it slips sometimes. I want to be sure I remember who has been so kind to me today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Darl. My name is Dr. Panjoj. And I will be as gentle as possible. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit… a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll note it. Now, let's listen to your lungs… Deep breath, please. Everything sounds clear on both sides. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… Good, good reflexes. A little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Everything seems within normal limits, considering your history. Now, let's get that blood draw done to determine your blood type. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, a few minutes, you say? That’s… good. I do hope the needle isn’t too big. I’ve never been very good with needles. But if you say it won’t take long… alright. Go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just be quick, if you would. And perhaps I could have a little sip of water afterwards? My mouth feels a bit dry all of a sudden. Is everything… clean in here? It looks very clean, I think. Just… checking. Old habits, you see. I always liked things to be neat and tidy. My husband used to say I was a bit of a fussbudget. He was a good man. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. Everything is sterile and clean. And you’ll have a sip of water as soon as we’re finished. I’ll let the nurse take it from here. She’s very skilled and gentle. Let's get a blood type and a basic metabolic panel, please. Just relax your arm for the nurse, and she’ll take care of you. It will only be a small prick, and it will be over before you know it. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A small prick, you say? That’s… good. As long as it’s small. And you’ll be right here, you said? That’s… reassuring. I do hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I’ve never been very brave when it comes to these things. Just… hurry, if you would. And perhaps a nice cup of tea afterwards? That would be lovely. Do what you need to do. I trust you both.
