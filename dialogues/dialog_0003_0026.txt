DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… tiring. Just terribly tiring, dear. I get so weak. It comes and goes, you know? Not like I’ve been doing anything strenuous, mind you. It’s just… there. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers? Something high. I don't rightly remember. It’s all a blur these days.
DOCTOR: "Tiring" is rather vague, Ms. Oitker. Could you elaborate on this weakness?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Oh, heavens. Well… like when you try to get up from a chair and it just… takes effort. More effort than it should. And my arms feel like noodles sometimes. Especially after… well, I don't even remember what after. Just… after things. It's not constant, you understand. Comes and goes. Like a bad mood, almost. But a physical one. My husband says I nap too much, too. He thinks I'm just getting old. Men. They never understand.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a tricky one. It feels like… well, a good long while. Months, certainly. Maybe even longer? Time just… slips away, you know? It’s not like it was sudden. It just… crept up on me. I suppose it's been worse lately, though. That's probably why I finally bothered coming in. Old age creeping in, I suppose. Though I do keep active, you know. I used to… well, I did things. Important things. Underwater. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Underwater?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Commercial diving, dear. A woman can do anything, you know. Used to, anyway. It was a good life. Rough, but good. Lots of… machinery. And fish. Though it was all a long time ago. Before… well, before everything. My knees aren't what they used to be, though. Perhaps that has something to do with it. All that… pressure. Do you know anything about diving? It’s very… specialized work. Not for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Fascinating, Ms. Oitker, truly. However, let’s focus on the present. Aside from the diving… any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my knees, as I said. They ache, you know? Especially in the cold. And my heart… the doctor years ago said something about a little flutter. Nothing serious, he said. Just old age again, probably. And I take a little pill for my… water retention, I think it is. Makes me go to the bathroom a lot, though. But that's it, I believe. I try to stay healthy. Eat my vegetables. Mostly. Though my husband makes a lovely roast beef… and that’s hard to resist. Is all this relevant? Honestly, I get so confused with all these questions.
DOCTOR: So, knee pain, a history of “flutter” – presumably atrial fibrillation – and a diuretic for fluid retention. Do you recall the name of the diuretic?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, no. Names just… vanish. It’s a little white pill. That's all I know. It has a… an “H” in it, maybe? Or a "P"? I truly don't remember. My daughter used to manage all my medications, but she moved away, you see. And my husband… well, he forgets things too. It's just a little white pill I take every morning. Helps with the swelling, you know. In my ankles. And sometimes my feet. Honestly, I wish I could remember these things. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Allergies? Let me think... I don't believe so. Nothing springs to mind. I’ve had so many pills over the years, you see. For this and that. I don't recall ever having a reaction to anything. Though… there was that time I got a rash after eating shrimp. But that was years ago, and I suspect it was just bad shrimp. My husband always said I shouldn't eat such things. He has a very sensitive stomach, you see. Honestly, I can't recall ever being allergic to a pill, though. Just that shrimp. It was a terrible rash. Very itchy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. It will be quick.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. As long as it’s quick. I do hate being poked and prodded, you know. Always have. My husband says I'm a delicate flower. Though I assure you, I used to be quite strong. Underwater, you see. But my knees… they aren’t what they used to be. Perhaps you should be careful with them. Do you know anything about the pressure underwater? It’s quite… substantial.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Slight edema present in bilateral lower extremities. Some crepitus noted in both knees. Alright, Ms. Oitker, that was quick enough, I presume?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Yes, very quick. Crepitus, you say? That sounds… unpleasant. Is that bad? My knees have been aching something awful lately, you see. Especially in the mornings. And the swelling... well, that's why I'm taking that little white pill, isn't it? Honestly, I wish my daughter were here. She always knew what to ask the doctors. And she understood all the… the terminology. Crepitus... it doesn’t sound good at all. Is it the diving? Do you think it could be the diving?
DOCTOR: While the diving may have contributed, the most likely cause of your symptoms at this point is osteoarthritis, exacerbated by your age and weight. The edema suggests some degree of heart failure, which needs further investigation. We'll need to run some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP to assess your kidney function and heart health. I'm also ordering an EKG to evaluate the “flutter” you mentioned.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those… tests? And heart failure? Good heavens, that sounds dreadful. I don't like the sound of any of this, dear. Are you sure it's not just old age? My husband always says I worry too much. And all those… panels and counts... will they hurt? Honestly, I'm not a very good patient, you know. I faint easily. And all this talk of failure... it's just terribly upsetting. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help? Do you have any tea here? A strong cup, with milk? And perhaps a biscuit? It always calms my nerves.
DOCTOR: The tests are standard procedures, Ms. Oitker, and are necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They will not be particularly painful. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood. As for the “flutter,” an EKG is a simple, non-invasive procedure. I will order the tests now, and the nurses will explain the process. I'm afraid we do not have tea or biscuits available. We are a medical facility, not a tea room. .
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose. Very well. It’s just… a lot to take in. And no tea? Honestly, you’d think a doctor's office would have a little tea for a frail old woman. Very well. I’ll… I’ll see the nurses, then. But if I feel faint, I want you to know. I do faint, you know. And I’d like a chair, a comfortable one, for the blood tests. And perhaps a cool cloth for my forehead. And… and perhaps someone to hold my hand? Is that too much to ask?
