DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's this tiredness. Just… draining. I don't have the energy I used to, not at all. It comes and goes, but when it comes, I just… lie down. My husband says I'm sleeping too much, but it’s not a restful sleep, you see? More like… collapsing. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off? Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Right, tiredness… and not feeling rested even with sleep. And the lab results… yes. Numbers being off isn't terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, it isn’t! I mean, I was a commercial diver for… well, a long time. You don't need numbers when you're wrestling with the ocean, do you? Just good sense and strong arms. This… this feels different. Not like a hard day's work. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving… quite a career. And you're right, that’s a different kind of exhaustion altogether. So, this fatigue isn't related to physical exertion, it just… happens. When did you first start noticing this "just happening," and has it been getting worse, staying the same, or better?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, when did it start? That’s a difficult one. Things all blur together after a while, don't they? Probably… oh, six months, maybe? Around the time the weather turned colder, I think. And yes, it has gotten worse. I used to be able to… well, do things. Garden, keep up with the house. Now? Now I mostly sit. My husband, bless his heart, does most everything.
DOCTOR: Six months… around the change in weather. And a noticeable decline in your activity level. Alright. And besides the tiredness and sitting more, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My legs feel… heavy, sometimes. Like they're filled with lead. Not always, but often enough to be bothersome. And I ache. A dull ache, all over, really. Not a sharp pain, just… a constant reminder that I'm getting old, I suppose. It's probably just my age, honestly.
DOCTOR: Heavy legs and a general ache… Okay. And you said “general,” meaning all over?
PATIENT: Yes, all over. It’s not like a specific joint, or a pulled muscle. It's just… everywhere. Like I've been run over by a very slow truck, if you can imagine. It’s not debilitating, mind you, but it’s… unpleasant. And frankly, exhausting. It all just adds to the tiredness, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see how that would be draining. Let's take a look at these lab results… Hmm. Your Vitamin D is quite low, and your creatinine kinase is elevated, which can be related to muscle issues. Your hemoglobin is also a bit on the low side. Now, these things don't tell the whole story, of course. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any change in your skin color?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not particularly. I get a little winded climbing the stairs, perhaps, but that's to be expected at my age. Skin color… I don't know. I don't really look at my skin. It's skin, isn’t it? I get a little paler in the winter, I suppose, but that’s the lack of sun. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those sorts of things. I'm just tired.
DOCTOR: Right, tiredness being the main issue. And no noticeable changes in breathing or skin color. Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, dear. These old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be very careful. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your reflexes and strength. And I’ll take a look at your skin. If you could just lie back, that would be wonderful. Deep breaths in and out, please… Good. Heart sounds are regular… lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not concerningly so. Alright, now let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It’s not as strong as it used to be, I admit. All these years of… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, yes, a little weaker than expected, but not drastically so. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Skin is pale and a bit dry. No rashes or unusual markings. Okay, Ardelle, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of fatigue, muscle weakness, and likely a Vitamin D deficiency. Your low hemoglobin is also something we need to investigate further. It could be related to the fatigue and weakness. I want to order some additional blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'm also going to prescribe a Vitamin D supplement to start.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Well, I suppose that's to be expected. I just… I want to feel like myself again. All these tests and numbers… It’s all a bit overwhelming, honestly. And a supplement? Will that help? I just want to be able to… garden again, you know? It's a silly thing, but it makes me happy.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s overwhelming. And no, gardening is not a silly thing at all. It's perfectly reasonable to want to get back to doing what you enjoy. The tests will help us figure out the root cause of your fatigue, and hopefully, pinpoint a way to get you feeling better. The Vitamin D supplement is a good starting point, as a deficiency can definitely contribute to tiredness and muscle weakness. It may take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference, but we can monitor your levels to ensure it's working. I'm also going to order a complete blood count and iron studies to rule out anemia, which can also cause fatigue. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... let me think. No, not that I recall. I’ve never had any trouble with medicines before. I used to take something for my joints, years ago, but I stopped taking it a long time ago. It didn’t seem to do much good, honestly. And I’ve never had any trouble with… well, anything, really. I’m a pretty sturdy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. I'll send the lab orders electronically, and you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. I’ll also give you a prescription for the Vitamin D supplement. It's a high dose to start, to get your levels up quickly. Take it with food, as it's better absorbed that way. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you're feeling. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or if your fatigue worsens, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not really. You've explained everything very clearly, dear. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll just wait for the tests, and hope for the best. Thank you. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. And don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here’s the prescription and the lab order information. Take care, and try to rest. .
PATIENT: Alright, dear, you too. .
