DOCTOR: Hi Candis, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to sit here and explain everything. Just… tired. Really tired. And I've been… eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don't look at me like that, it's not as weird as it sounds, and frankly, I don't appreciate the judgment. It just… tastes good sometimes, okay? And it's making me even more tired. Is that enough information for you to get started?
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. “Really tired” and… consuming dirt. I appreciate you being honest with me. It's good to know exactly what's going on. Just to clarify, how long have you been feeling this extreme fatigue, and for how long have you been eating dirt?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… let me think. The tiredness? Seems like always, really. But worse lately, maybe a couple of months. And the… earth-eating. Ugh. That started, oh, I’d say… around the same time, maybe a little before the worst of the tiredness. It’s not like I’m out there digging holes, you know? Just… a little handful here and there when I’m gardening. Though, now that I think about it, I’ve been craving it more and more. It's…hard to explain. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months of increasing fatigue and dirt consumption. And the cravings are getting stronger. That’s helpful. It won't take long, Candis, I promise. I just need to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Have you noticed any other changes – like any stomach problems, changes in your appetite, or any trouble with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Stomach problems? Well, sometimes it feels a little… unsettled, yeah. Though, that could be anything, I eat pretty simply. Appetite's fine, I guess. Maybe a little less than usual, but I haven't been hungry hungry. Memory… look, I'm 79, dear. My memory isn’t what it used to be. That’s just old age. Don’t go looking for something wrong that isn’t there. Honestly, I don't appreciate being interrogated like this. Are you a detective or a doctor?
DOCTOR: You’re right to call me out, Candis. I apologize if I’m coming across as interrogative. It’s just that these things can be clues to what’s happening. I’m a doctor, and I’m trying to understand everything that might be contributing to how you're feeling. So, unsettled stomach… how frequent is that?
PATIENT: Frequent? Oh, I don’t know. A few times a week, maybe? It’s not terrible. Just… not right. Like a little bit of indigestion, but it comes and goes. And it's not from the dirt, if that's what you're thinking. I've been eating things for years, it's just this tiredness is new. Look, I don’t have time for all of this. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going around in circles? I have a garden to tend, you know. Tomatoes don't pick themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few times a week of indigestion-like symptoms. And you're right, the new fatigue is the main concern. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – things like headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, or any changes in your skin or nails?
PATIENT: Headaches, sometimes. Just normal old-age headaches. Dizziness? Not really. Skin… I’m old, dear. My skin is wrinkly. What do you expect? Nails? They’re… nails. Look, I really don’t understand why you need to know all of this. It feels like you're looking for something that isn’t there. I just want to know why I'm so tired. And why I'm craving dirt. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: No, Candis, that’s not too much to ask at all. I understand your frustration. Let's talk about the dirt craving first. Have you ever had cravings like this before, or is this something completely new?
