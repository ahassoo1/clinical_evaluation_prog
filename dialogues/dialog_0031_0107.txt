DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart, it feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not regular. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not every day, but when it happens, it’s… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your heart feels like it's beating too fast and irregularly, and this has been happening for a few weeks. That certainly sounds concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe what you mean by "funny"?
PATIENT: Hmm… “funny”… It’s hard to say. Not ha-ha funny. More like… a flapping. Like a bird in my chest, maybe? It doesn’t hurt, not really. Just… feels off. And it makes me a little… tired sometimes after it happens. It doesn't last long, though. Maybe a minute or two.
DOCTOR: A flapping sensation... that’s a helpful description, thank you. And it doesn’t cause any pain, but leaves you feeling tired afterward, lasting only a minute or two. To get a better picture, can you tell me about what you're typically doing when this happens?
PATIENT: Usually… nothing much. I’m just… sitting. Or maybe walking, slow. It happened once when I was making tea for my wife. Sometimes when I watch TV. It doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing, really. That’s what’s confusing. It just… starts. I don't feel stressed or anything when it happens, either. Just… boom. There it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem to be related to activity or stress, which is good to know. It just occurs spontaneously. Has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Same job, same house, wife is good. We didn't go on vacation this year, but that’s okay. Nothing new to eat, nothing new to drink. I… I don’t know. Everything is normal. Maybe the weather? It’s been very hot, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand. Nothing majorly different in your routine or lifestyle. You mentioned the heat – that’s a reasonable thought, as dehydration can sometimes contribute to these types of sensations. Before we move on, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've experienced alongside this feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes… a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light-headed. And… maybe a little short of breath. But just for a few seconds, when the heart is doing the flapping. It goes away when the heart stops. No coughing, no swelling… nothing else. I don't feel sick, like with a cold. Just the heart, and a little dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally dizziness and shortness of breath occur briefly during these episodes. That’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I've never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just… the usual check-ups when I was a kid, I think. No problems. My wife says I’m very healthy, but she also says I need to eat more vegetables. I go to work every day. I don't smoke, I drink a little tea, that’s it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No prior medical diagnoses and you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything, even as a child?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was maybe eight, climbing a tree. But that's it. Just the broken arm. They put it in a cast, and it healed. No other surgeries, no other hospital visits. My wife always tells everyone I’m very lucky. I think she worries too much.
DOCTOR: That’s very reassuring. No significant surgical history either. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had heart problems, or any other medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or sudden unexplained death?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father, he had… something with his blood pressure, I think. He was always tired. He lived in Yemen, so it was hard to know exactly. Doctors weren’t so good there. He died when I was young, maybe ten years old. My mother… she was healthy, I think. No problems. She died when I was older, from an accident. No brothers or sisters. So, just my father with the… the blood pressure thing. Nothing else that I know about, really. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had some issues with blood pressure, but limited information is available. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you take any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just tea. Black tea, with a little sugar. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget. She buys them, they sit on the counter… and then I forget. I eat normal food. Sometimes too much rice, maybe. But no pills, no vitamins, no nothing. Just tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or supplements. And you drink black tea with sugar. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, sir. I’ve never been allergic to anything. I eat everything. My wife makes spicy food sometimes, and I eat it all. She asks if I'm sure, and I say yes. No hives, no itching, no trouble breathing… nothing. I don’t have allergies to dust, or pollen, or anything like that either. I think I'm very lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My wife always says I should go to the doctor more often. She would be happy to hear I'm finally getting checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. I'm hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, but I don't detect any murmurs or unusual sounds at this time. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 140/90. I'm going to check your pulse. Your pulse is also a little fast at 95 beats per minute. I'm also going to take a quick look at your extremities and check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, and your extremities appear healthy. Based on this brief exam, your heart rate and blood pressure are higher than ideal. To get a more comprehensive picture, I would like to order a few tests. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Tests? Yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what’s going on. My wife will be very relieved if we find out. What kind of tests? Are they… painful? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation regarding needles. We'll try to minimize discomfort as much as possible. The tests I'm recommending are a basic blood panel to check your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We’ll also do an EKG – an electrocardiogram – which is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. This will help us identify any irregularities in your heart rhythm. Finally, a chest X-ray would be helpful to rule out any underlying lung issues. The blood draw will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually quick. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. And the chest X-ray is non-invasive. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers I can handle. And a picture, that’s fine. The needle… I don’t like it, but if you say I need it, I’ll do it. I trust you, Doctor. So, yes. Let’s do the tests. How long will they take? And will I get the results right away? I have to go to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we could agree on a plan. The tests themselves shouldn’t take long – perhaps 30-45 minutes total. The blood draw will be the most time-consuming, but the technician is very skilled. Getting the results, unfortunately, won’t be instantaneous. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process everything. We can likely have them back by Wednesday. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine or strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, severe dizziness, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, Wednesday that's fine. No… I think that’s all. No caffeine, no running… I don’t do much running anyway. Just tea. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. My wife will be happy to hear we have a plan. I guess… I guess that’s everything. Do I need to do anything before the tests? Like… not eat breakfast?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad I could help. Yes, that’s a good question. For the blood tests, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water, from tonight until after the blood draw tomorrow morning. It's important to be well-hydrated, so please drink plenty of water. My assistant will provide you with more detailed instructions before you leave today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. 8-12 hours, no food… I can do that. My wife will remind me, for sure. She's very good at that. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. I appreciate your help. I think I'll go home now, and try to remember not to eat anything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad we were able to get this started. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. My assistant will be with you shortly to provide those instructions. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
