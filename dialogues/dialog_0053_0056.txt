DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the foggiest why I’m here. Some… fuss about stress, I believe? My ex-wife probably convinced someone I was… unraveling. It’s just… young people these days have no resilience. The work is the same as it always has been. A bit of cataloging, keeping order… perfectly straightforward. I simply require a quiet space to think. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, someone is concerned enough to have you seen. And even straightforward work can cause…well, let's call them disruptions to one's system. So, tell me, when did you start feeling…off?
PATIENT: “Off”? Doctor, really. I feel perfectly… capable. Though I suppose… perhaps a little more… distracted lately. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific time. The university… they keep changing things. New software, new policies... utterly pointless distractions. Probably last semester, I should say. Possibly the one before. It all blurs together, frankly. It's the principle of the thing, you see.
DOCTOR: Distracted... okay. And can you describe this distraction?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a lack of focus, Doctor. A simple inability to concentrate. I find myself rereading the same paragraph several times, losing my place in the catalog… trivial things! Though, admittedly, the students aren’t helping matters. Loud, disorganized, and entirely uninterested in the Dewey Decimal System. A complete disaster, really. It's a generation... lacking discipline, I tell you. It’s hardly a medical issue.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the changes and the students, Mr. Schlatterer. But even things that aren't strictly medical can cause medical symptoms. Sometimes stress manifests in ways that require attention. So, just to clarify, this trouble concentrating – has it been getting worse?
PATIENT: “Worse”? Doctor, I haven’t kept a meticulous log of my mental state, you understand. It fluctuates, naturally. Some days are better than others. But yes, I suppose… I’ve been requiring more… effort to accomplish the same tasks. A perfectly normal phenomenon for a man of my age, surely. But to attribute it to some… condition… it's preposterous. Honestly, I have papers to grade. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: We'll try not to take up too much of your time. Let’s move on to other areas then. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Perfectly adequate, thank you very much. I’ve always been a sound sleeper. Though… now that you mention it… I do wake up occasionally… thinking about the… the state of the library. Books mis-shelved, students leaving coffee rings… dreadful. But it’s hardly a sleep disorder, Doctor. Just a conscientious librarian's anxieties. I assure you, my physical health is impeccable. I've always taken pride in my constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Doctor, are you suggesting I’ve lost my taste for… civilization? I eat perfectly well, thank you. Though I must admit, the university cafeteria has gone downhill. Everything is pre-packaged, utterly tasteless… But that's a matter of culinary standards, not… well, not medical issues. Really, this line of questioning is quite… insulting. I’ve been a pillar of this community for decades! If you’ll excuse me… I believe I’ve wasted enough time here. .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, then. Just to rule things out. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… it won't take long. Please, have a seat. It's just standard procedure.
