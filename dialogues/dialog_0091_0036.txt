DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is... good to meet you as well. I am here for... a check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? They told me I needed to come. It is all very confusing, these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, I understand. It can be quite confusing navigating insurance requirements. We’ll certainly get everything sorted out. So, this is a preventative check-up as required by your Medicare coverage. That’s perfectly alright. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Hmm. I work, yes. At the... the food place. It is... physical work. I lift things. I do not... feel sick. I eat... normal food. Is that what you want to know? I do not understand what "overall health" means.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. You're right to ask for clarification. "Overall health" simply refers to how you generally feel and function, and if you've experienced any recent changes. You mentioned you work a physical job, lifting things – that’s helpful information. Since you say you don't feel sick, have you noticed any pain, fatigue, changes in your appetite or weight, or any difficulty with sleep recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes my back… aches. After work, yes? It is normal. Lifting. I take… something for it. A white pill. I do not know the name. Sleep… yes, I sleep. Not very good sleep, but I sleep. Appetite… I eat when I am hungry. Weight... I think the same. I do not weigh myself. Is this enough information? I do not understand why you ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Barban. Thank you. The back pain after work is important to note, and we can certainly discuss that further. And it's alright if you don’t know the name of the pill – we can look that up later if needed. I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health, so I can best understand what might be going on and ensure everything is functioning as it should. Now, let's talk a bit more about that back pain. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It… hurts. A dull ache. In my lower back. It is worse after I lift heavy boxes. It goes away if I lie down. I do not think it is very serious. Just… work. My father had back pain too, from working. Is that… important? I do not like complaining.
DOCTOR: It's not complaining at all, Mr. Barban. Providing this information is crucial for me to understand your situation. Knowing your father had similar pain is definitely important—family history can be very telling. A dull ache in the lower back, worse after lifting and relieved by lying down… that gives me a better understanding. Does the pain radiate—meaning does it travel down your legs, or into your buttocks?
PATIENT: Radiate? I do not know this word. Travel… sometimes I feel a little… tingling. In my right leg. Not always. Only sometimes, when the pain is very bad. It is… unpleasant. Like pins and needles, yes? I do not like it. It goes away when I sit down. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that's exactly what I mean by radiate. That tingling sensation in your right leg is important information. It sounds like the pain may be affecting a nerve. To get a clearer picture, let's do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? Will it… hurt? I do not like being poked and prodded. I have no problem telling you things, but I do not want… unpleasantness. I need to get back to work, you know. I do not have much time.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Barban. The exam is quite straightforward and shouldn't be unpleasant. I'll be checking your range of motion, reflexes, and some sensation in your legs and feet. It’s important to rule out anything serious and help determine the cause of your pain. It shouldn't take long, and I’ll be explaining everything as I go. We’ll start with just having you stand and walk a few steps for me. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Walking… yes, I can do that. But please, do not… twist me. I have had bad experiences with doctors before. They like to… move things around too much. And do not make me say “ow,” yes? I do not like saying “ow.”
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. I will be very gentle, and we’ll move at your pace. I will not twist anything, and I certainly don’t want to hear you say “ow.” We'll stop immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Just a simple walk, then I'll observe how you move. If you could just walk back and forth a few times for me, please. I’ll be watching your gait and posture.
PATIENT: Is this… good enough? It feels strange being watched. I usually do not walk like this. I walk faster when I am working, yes. It is more efficient.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Barban. That was very helpful. I noticed a bit of stiffness in your gait, and it appears your range of motion is somewhat limited. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to briefly examine your lower back. I'll gently palpate the area to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. I'll also check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Again, please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Yes! That… is not comfortable. It is… sensitive there. Especially on the right side. Do not push. Just… leave it. I told you I do not like being poked. It is… aggravating. I have had enough of this examination. Can we stop now? I need to go back to work, yes?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Barban. We will stop immediately. I apologize for causing you discomfort. It’s clear you're experiencing sensitivity in your lower back, and we don’t need to continue if it’s causing you pain. Based on what you’ve told me and the limited examination we were able to complete, it sounds like you may be experiencing a muscle strain or a possible disc issue. Given your discomfort with the examination, it's difficult to determine the exact cause at this time. To get a clearer picture, I would recommend an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Will that… hurt? And how long will it take? I have work, yes. I cannot be away for too long. And who will pay for this… X-ray? Medicare, yes? It is very confusing. I do not want any surprises. I prefer to just… manage it myself, if possible. Perhaps more white pills?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Barban. The X-ray itself is painless – it's a quick imaging procedure. It shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes at the imaging center. And yes, Medicare should cover the cost; we'll verify your coverage beforehand to ensure there are no surprises. While more white pills might provide temporary relief, it’s important to understand the underlying cause of your pain to prevent it from worsening. X-ray will help us determine that. Alternatively, if you’re hesitant about the X-ray, we could start with a course of physical therapy. A physical therapist can assess your condition, teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles, and provide pain management techniques. Would that be something you'd be interested in?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… hmm. Exercises… yes. I do not mind exercises, as long as they are not too difficult. I am a strong man, yes? I lift heavy boxes all day. But I do not want anyone… twisting me. And can I still work while doing this… therapy? I need to earn money. Is there a cost for this therapy? I need to know everything before I agree to anything. This is all very complicated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. That’s a very sensible approach, and it’s important to have all the information before making a decision. Physical therapy is a great option, and we can certainly discuss your concerns. A qualified physical therapist will assess your strength and range of motion and develop a personalized exercise plan that’s tailored to your needs. They will not twist you or force you to do anything that’s uncomfortable. They'll focus on strengthening your back muscles, improving your posture, and teaching you proper lifting techniques. Generally, Medicare covers a significant portion of physical therapy costs. There may be a copay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. And yes, you should be able to continue working while attending physical therapy sessions. We can work with the therapist to schedule appointments around your work schedule. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a reputable physical therapy clinic in the area?
PATIENT: Yes… a referral would be good. A clinic near the… food place would be best. I do not want to travel too far. And make sure they understand I need to keep working. And no twisting. Is that understood? It is very important. I do not trust these… therapy people. They always want to… push. But if it helps my back, and I can still work… then maybe. Do you have a list of these… therapy people, so I can choose one myself? I want to be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure the referral specifies your need to continue working and your aversion to any forceful manipulations. I will only refer you to clinics with excellent reputations and experienced therapists. Here is a list of three clinics near your workplace. I’ve included information about each therapist's experience and areas of expertise. You can review their profiles and choose the one you feel most comfortable with. They all accept Medicare. I will also include a note on the referral form explaining your concerns about continuing to work and avoiding any aggressive treatment. Before we conclude, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. The list is good. I will… look at it later. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… patient. I do not like doctors, but you were… tolerable. I hope this… therapy helps my back. And I hope it does not cost too much money. I should get back to work now. I have boxes to lift. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Barban. I'm glad I could help. And I understand your hesitation with healthcare providers – I'm pleased I was able to provide a tolerable experience. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns regarding the physical therapy referral or your condition. We are here to support you. And please, prioritize proper lifting techniques and listen to your body. Have a safe and productive day at work.
