DOCTOR: Hi Jahaad, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely, but I’ve noticed some swelling… somewhere. It's rather vague, if I'm honest. I apologize for the lack of clarity. I don’t recall exactly where it is, just that there is some swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright if it’s hard to pinpoint. We'll figure it out together. When did you first notice this swelling?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Honestly, I’m struggling to recall the exact date. It feels… recent, perhaps within the last week or so? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more precise for you. Is it alright if I say roughly a week?
DOCTOR: A week is perfectly fine. And it's alright to be unsure – memory isn't always perfect. Has the swelling changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That’s a very good point. It… feels like it's gotten slightly worse, perhaps? Not dramatically, but… a bit more noticeable each day, I think. It's not painful, thankfully, just… present. I can’t really say how much worse, just a general impression. I hope that isn't too unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Not at all, that’s helpful. And good to hear it's not painful. Okay, so swelling, noticed roughly within the last week, gradually worsening, no pain. Where exactly are you noticing this swelling?
PATIENT: This is where it gets tricky, Doctor. I believe… it's on my face. Though, whether it’s on one side or both, I can’t quite say. Perhaps around my jawline? It’s a rather frustrating lack of recollection, I assure you. I’m truly sorry for being so vague. Is it possible it could be… elsewhere? I feel I should be able to pinpoint it better.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize – we'll get there. Okay, so potentially around the jawline, possibly on one or both sides. Let's try to narrow it down. Has anything specific happened recently that might be related?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a thoughtful question. Let me see… recently? I’ve been working quite a bit, as usual, mostly with patients who have… communication difficulties. No real changes to my routine, I don’t think. I did have a slightly… unusual meal a few days ago. Moroccan tagine, but I make it myself, so I know what’s in it. It didn't seem… different, but perhaps? It feels a bit of a long shot.
DOCTOR: Okay, working with patients, normal routine, and a Moroccan tagine a few days ago. You mentioned working with patients – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I am a Speech-Language Pathologist, Doctor. I work with individuals who have difficulties with their speech, language, or swallowing. A lot of my work involves helping people regain communication skills after an injury or illness, or assisting those with developmental conditions. It's quite fulfilling, though demanding at times. I see patients in a clinic setting, mostly. Perhaps the stress… could be a factor? I’m simply trying to recall anything that might be relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Speech-Language Pathologist – that's helpful to know. Stress is definitely a possibility. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, do proceed. I’ll do my best to remain still. I hope I won’t be too difficult a patient!
DOCTOR: Not at all. I’m just going to gently feel around your jawline and neck. Let me know if anything feels tender or particularly uncomfortable. Hmm, no noticeable increase in temperature. And I don't feel any obvious enlarged lymph nodes. Is there any discomfort here, or here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't feel… particularly uncomfortable. Perhaps a slight… pressure, but not painful. It’s difficult to say, honestly. It feels rather normal, if I'm being truthful. And no, nothing on that side feels different than the other. It’s rather perplexing, isn’t it? I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all. This is just taking some detective work. Okay, let's check your mouth and throat. Could you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Ahhh… Is that sufficient? Please let me know if you need me to do anything else. It’s rather strange, isn’t it, that I can’t pinpoint the source of this swelling? Perhaps it’s my imagination?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat looks clear, no obvious redness or swelling there. Tonsils look normal size. And your uvula is midline. Hmm. Let’s just quickly check your ears.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I trust everything appears to be in order? I must admit, I find this whole situation rather… unsettling. A vague swelling with no discernible cause… It’s not like me to be so… unsure. Please proceed with the ear examination when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, ear canals look clear. Eardrums appear normal, no signs of infection or fluid. Everything looks good there. So, clear throat, normal ears, no enlarged lymph nodes, no fever. Given your work as a Speech-Language Pathologist, and the gradual onset of this swelling without pain, it's possible this is related to mild swelling of the salivary glands. It’s not typical, but could be triggered by stress or even slight dehydration. It is also possible it’s a benign muscle strain. However, since it’s persisting, and I want to rule out anything more serious, I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for infection and inflammation and a salivary gland ultrasound. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A complete blood count and a salivary gland ultrasound. Yes, that would certainly put my mind at ease. I appreciate your thoroughness. It’s good to have a plan. I confess, the idea of a muscle strain or stress-related swelling seems… plausible, given my workload. But it's best to be certain. Do you anticipate these tests will take long to schedule?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I can order them electronically right now to the lab across the street, and they usually have same-day appointments. I’ll also have my nurse schedule the ultrasound for you – they have appointments available early next week. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated and trying to manage your stress levels as much as possible. If you experience any new symptoms—fever, pain, difficulty swallowing, or any changes to your voice—please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. Same-day blood work and an ultrasound early next week. I'll certainly prioritize hydration and stress management. And I will absolutely contact the clinic if anything changes. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter; I feel much better having a plan in place. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. Just one more thing: I'm going to have my nurse print out a list of resources for stress management techniques, including some local mindfulness classes. It's just something to have, in case you're interested. Otherwise, no, I think that covers everything for now. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and go from there. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: That’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. Resources for stress management would be greatly appreciated. And no, I believe that covers all my questions for now. Thank you again for your patience and thoroughness. I truly appreciate it. I'll await the nurse’s instructions regarding the blood work and ultrasound. Have a good day, Doctor Hernandez.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could help. My nurse will be in shortly with the instructions. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: .
