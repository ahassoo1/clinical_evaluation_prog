DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good morning, Doctor. Just here for a physical. Gotta get cleared for… well, a tryout. Sports team thing. Want to get it over with quick if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kingan. A pre-participation physical, understood. We’ll do our best to be efficient. Just a few questions first, then we’ll move to a brief exam. Now, regarding this sports team… what sport is this for, and what level of play are you aiming for – recreational, school team, something more competitive?
PATIENT: Uh, it’s… Mongolian wrestling. And it’s… not really recreational, but not professional either. More like a… serious hobby? I guess? It’s a local thing, pretty competitive locally, though. Lots of older guys still doing it.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling – excellent! A physically demanding sport, certainly. And "serious hobby" gives me a good sense. Just to be thorough, have you had a physical within the last year?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s been… a while. Probably five, six years? Something like that. I usually just… feel around, make sure nothing’s broken, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. While self-assessment is good, a comprehensive physical is important, especially before starting a new or increased activity level. Alright. Let’s start with a little bit of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I had a bad shoulder injury years ago, playing wrestling when I was younger, but that healed up okay. I think. No diabetes, no heart stuff, blood pressure’s probably fine. I don’t… go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous shoulder injury is good to know. And you haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, a bit about your family. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… my dad had some heart trouble when he got older, I think. Something to do with his valves, maybe? And my grandma, on my mom’s side, had… cancer, I think. Lung cancer. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart valve issues in your father and lung cancer in your grandmother. That’s helpful to know. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. Bad for wrestling, you know? Gotta have good lungs for that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Good lungs are essential! Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes. A little bit with dinner, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing crazy. Not enough to cause trouble, I hope.
DOCTOR: A couple of times a week, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen if my shoulder’s bothering me. But that's it. Usually just rub it with some balm, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for shoulder discomfort. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good baseline. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at that shoulder you mentioned. Do you have any current pain or discomfort anywhere else, besides the shoulder?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. Shoulder’s a little stiff sometimes, especially in the morning, but that’s about it. I’m pretty tough, Doctor. Wrestlers usually are.
DOCTOR: I’m sure you are, Mr. Kingan. And that’s excellent, but even the toughest individuals benefit from a check-up. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm…
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but we can monitor that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at that shoulder. Can you lift your arm up, and rotate it inward and outward?
PATIENT: Ow… yeah, there. It's not… smooth. Feels kinda tight. And it cracks a little when I rotate it outward.
DOCTOR: I feel some crepitus with external rotation, and you do have some tenderness to palpation here, along the rotator cuff. Range of motion is limited, especially with external rotation. I suspect some mild rotator cuff impingement or tendinitis. We’ll need to get an X-ray to rule out any structural issues. Do you recall how you injured your shoulder originally?
PATIENT: Oh, ages ago. When I was young. Just… a bad throw, I think. During wrestling practice. Got thrown kinda hard, landed on it wrong. It hurt like heck, but I just… taped it up and kept going. We don’t really… fuss over injuries much in wrestling.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s unfortunately a common approach. Alright. Given your blood pressure reading and the shoulder pain, I’d like to order an X-ray of your shoulder and some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. This will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any significant difficulty breathing, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing like that. Just… the shoulder hurts sometimes. And I get a little winded when I wrestle, but that’s just ‘cause I’m old, I guess. Old wrestlers get winded.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll proceed with the X-ray and blood work. I’m going to write you a referral order for those. While we wait for the results, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates your shoulder pain. Also, I’d like to discuss some strategies to manage your blood pressure – lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise, and potentially medication if it doesn’t improve. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, can I still wrestle if I just… take some ibuprofen? I got a competition next month. I don’t want to miss it. Is that gonna mess things up?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand you’re eager to compete, and I admire your dedication. However, simply masking the pain with ibuprofen isn't a sustainable or safe solution. While ibuprofen can temporarily alleviate discomfort, it doesn't address the underlying issue with your shoulder, and it can even hide a more serious injury. And your slightly elevated blood pressure is also a concern that needs attention. Continuing to exert yourself strenuously could potentially worsen both conditions. I strongly advise against participating in the competition until we have the results of the X-ray and blood work, and we've discussed a proper treatment plan. We need to rule out any structural damage to your shoulder and get your blood pressure under control. It's better to be cautious now to avoid a more significant injury that could sideline you for a much longer period. Do you understand?
PATIENT: …Yeah, yeah, I understand. Just… frustrating, you know? I’ve been wrestling for years. But… alright. No competition. Get the X-ray, get the blood work. What's next? When do I get the results? And where do I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely. It’s tough to put your training on hold, but your long-term health is the priority. This form is for the imaging center across the street – they'll be able to get the X-ray done today. They'll send the results directly to my office. As for the blood work, the lab is just down the hall – I’ll have the nurse give you a requisition form. Typically, the results are back within 24 to 48 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. That sounds… good. Acceptable. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I’ll go get the X-ray done. And then the blood work. Hopefully, it’s nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take good care of you, Mr. Kingan. Remember, if you experience any sudden or severe pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's the nurse's number, if you have any questions while you're waiting for the results. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll be in touch soon.
