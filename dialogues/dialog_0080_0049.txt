DOCTOR: Hi Betty, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, I think it’s my ears. They just don't… work as well as they used to, you know? Things are a bit muffled. I can’t rightly say when it started, just… gradually, I suppose. It's a bit frustrating trying to hear folks sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening hearing. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a bit more about when you notice it the most?
PATIENT: Hmm… when do I notice it? Well, when there’s a bit of noise, definitely. Like, if the television’s on, or if a few people are talking at once… it all just kind of blends together. Quiet conversations are… harder, too. I find myself asking people to repeat themselves a lot. Though, sometimes I just… don’t catch what they said at all. Not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Betty. That sounds frustrating. So, it’s worse with background noise and quiet conversations are difficult. Have you noticed if it's worse in one ear compared to the other, or is it pretty much the same in both?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I think it might be a little worse in my left ear. Not a lot, mind you, but… yeah, maybe. It’s hard to say for sure, really. Everything seems a bit… distant, you know? It's not a sharp pain or anything, just… not as clear. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Betty. A little worse in the left ear, and generally sounds are just less clear. Okay. And have you ever experienced any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now and then, maybe? It’s not a constant thing, no. Sort of a… faint whistle, I suppose. It doesn’t bother me much, really. Comes and goes. Happens mostly when things are very quiet, I think. I just sort of… tune it out. Never thought much of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ringing, mostly in quiet environments. Good to know. Now, have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises, like machinery, music concerts, or anything like that, over a long period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, I don’t know, close to forty years. Lots of machines, that’s for sure. Sewing machines, stamping machines… all sorts of clatter and banging. Always had a bit of a ring in my ears after a long day, but I figured that was just part of the job, you know? Never wore earplugs or anything like that. They didn’t really tell us to back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long history of noise exposure at the shoe factory. That's very important information, Betty. And have you had any ear infections or other ear problems in the past that you can remember?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Let me see… I think I had one as a little girl, maybe? Nothing serious, just a bit of pain. And I think my son mentioned something about some wax buildup once, years ago. He might have taken me to a doctor for that, but… honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I don't recall having any trouble with my ears, aside from the factory noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible ear infection as a child and some mention of wax buildup, but generally no significant ear problems. I understand memory can be tricky. Now, I’d like to ask about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my hands, makes them ache something fierce sometimes. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a while back, so I take a pill for that. Something pink, I think. And… oh, yes, I had a bit of a tummy trouble a few years ago, but they fixed that with some medicine too. Aside from that… I think that’s all. I see Dr. Henderson for my arthritis, mostly. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some past tummy trouble. And you see Dr. Henderson for your arthritis. That’s helpful to know. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, that’s a tricky one. It’s… pink, as I said. Small pill. I have to take it every morning. Let me see… my son helps me with those things. He fills my pill box. I really couldn’t say what it’s called. It just says a bunch of letters and numbers on the bottle. I’m afraid I’m not very good with remembering names and things these days. Would it help if my son came in with me next time? He’s good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Betty. We can certainly look it up in your records or have your son help next time. Let's move on. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me see... I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s all I can really remember. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist, a long time ago. Just a simple break, nothing fancy. Other than that... no, I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I haven’t had to spend much time in a hospital, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist. Good to know. Now, one last few questions about your family history. Are there any instances of hearing loss, tinnitus , or other ear problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me see… my father was a bit hard of hearing when he got older, I think. But he never did anything about it, just turned up the volume on the radio, you know? And my aunt Millie… she used to complain about a ringing in her ears sometimes. But I don't know if it was the same as what I’ve got. Everyone in my family was a bit… stubborn, I think. Didn’t like going to the doctor much. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, some hearing loss in your father and tinnitus in your aunt. Alright, Betty, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a better look and test your hearing a little bit. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I trust you. It’s good to get things checked out, I suppose. I'm a bit nervous, but I’m sure you’ll be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. Your ear canals are a little narrow, which is common with age, and there’s a small amount of wax in both ears. The ear drums themselves look normal, no signs of infection or fluid. On the Weber test, you reported the sound was louder in your left ear, and the Rinne test shows some conductive hearing loss in both ears, but slightly worse on the left, which is consistent with what you've been describing. I’m also noting some mild inflammation in your left ear canal. So, based on this brief exam, it sounds like you likely have age-related hearing loss, possibly compounded by a bit of wax buildup and some mild inflammation. The inflammation could be contributing to the muffled sound and the ringing. It's not an emergency, but it's something we should address to improve your hearing. What are your thoughts on this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Age-related, you say? Well, I suppose that makes sense. I am getting on a bit, aren’t I? Wax buildup… I figured as much. Mild inflammation… is that bad? It all sounds a bit… complicated. So, what does that mean, doctor? What can we do about it? I just want to be able to hear my grandkids when they come to visit, you know? That’s all.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed, Betty, and you’re right to ask what we can do. It’s not too complicated! Age-related hearing loss is very common, and it’s usually gradual. The wax buildup can definitely contribute to muffled sound, and the inflammation is likely causing some discomfort and making things worse. The good news is there are several things we can try. First, we can gently remove the wax buildup. I can do that in the office. Secondly, we can try a mild topical steroid for a week or so to reduce the inflammation. And finally, if those don’t provide enough relief, we can discuss a hearing test to see if a hearing aid would be beneficial. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… good, actually. Gentle removal of the wax… that sounds nice. And a bit of something for the inflammation… I'm willing to try that. A hearing aid… well, I've never thought about that. I always thought those were for people who were completely deaf, you know? But if it would help me hear my grandkids… I suppose I’m willing to consider it. So, let’s start with the wax removal and the something for the inflammation? That sounds like a good plan to me. When can we do that, doctor?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Betty. That’s a very sensible approach. We can remove the wax right now, it only takes a few minutes. Then I'll write you a prescription for some ear drops – a steroid solution – to use twice a day for one week. After that, we can reassess how you’re feeling. If you’re still having trouble hearing, we can schedule a hearing test with the audiologist down the hall. Okay, Betty, all done. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, that wasn't bad at all, dear. A little cool, maybe, but not painful. It feels… clearer already, I think. Thank you. Now, the ear drops… how do I use those? Do I need to warm them up? And what if they sting? I'm a bit worried about stinging. I don't like stinging!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Betty! It's often a relief just to get the wax cleared out. The ear drops are very straightforward. They’re a suspension, so you'll need to shake the bottle gently before each use. Then, tilt your head to the side so the affected ear is facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. Place 2-3 drops into your ear, and then gently massage the base of your ear. Keep your head tilted for about 5 minutes to allow the drops to absorb. You don't need to warm them up—room temperature is fine. As for stinging, some people experience a very mild, temporary stinging sensation when they first use them, but it usually goes away quickly. If the stinging is severe or lasts for more than a few seconds, stop using the drops and give me a call. Do you have any other questions about the drops before I write the prescription?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s pretty clear. Shake, tilt, massage… and don’t panic if it stings. You've been very patient with me, doctor. I appreciate it. So, after a week, we’ll see if it’s helped? And then, maybe, we’ll talk about those hearing aids if it hasn’t? Do you think those are very… noticeable? I don’t want everyone staring at me, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. I’m happy to help. And yes, exactly. After a week, we'll reassess and see if the inflammation has come down and your hearing has improved. If it hasn't, we can discuss a hearing test. As for hearing aids, they’ve come a long way in recent years. They're much smaller and more discreet than they used to be. Many of them fit completely inside the ear canal, and they're designed to blend in with your skin tone. We can discuss different options and find one that’s comfortable and practically invisible. The audiologist will be able to show you some examples and answer all your questions. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that hearing test for you now, just in case?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Go ahead and schedule it, just in case. Better to be prepared, I suppose. Thank you, doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. Now, about my grandkids… what if I still can’t hear them very well even with the hearing aid? I don’t want to miss anything they say. They grow up so fast, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I understand completely. It's wonderful that you're so involved in your grandkids’ lives. If you’re still having trouble hearing even with a hearing aid, we can explore other options. Sometimes, a combination of strategies works best. For example, we can discuss communication techniques – things like making sure they’re facing you when they speak, reducing background noise, and asking them to repeat themselves if you don’t understand. We can also look at assistive listening devices, like amplified telephones or captioning services. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. We'll work together to find the best solution for your individual needs. Okay, I've scheduled you for a hearing test with the audiologist for August 9th at 10:00 AM. They'll be able to assess your hearing in more detail and recommend the best course of action. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. August 9th… I’ll put it in my calendar. You’ve been wonderful, doctor. Really wonderful. Thank you for taking the time to listen to an old woman ramble on. I better be going now, before I forget where I parked the car! Stop.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Betty. Don't worry about rambling, that's what I'm here for! And don’t worry about forgetting where you parked – it happens to the best of us. If you do get lost, just ask someone for help. Have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you on August 9th. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. .
PATIENT: .
