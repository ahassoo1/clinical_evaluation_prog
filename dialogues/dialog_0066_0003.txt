DOCTOR: Hi Jerrel, good to see you today. I'm Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, it’s… well, it’s this shaking. My hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure how long, to be honest. Old age, probably. What do you need to know? Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel, no need to rush, but I appreciate you being direct. “A bit now” isn’t super helpful for me to understand what’s going on, though. Can you try to remember when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Honestly? Vaguely. Maybe… six months ago? A year? It comes and goes, you see? Not constant. I was making a Negroni, and I spilled a little. Thought it was just my hand being clumsy. I make a very good Negroni, usually. But then it happened again, and again… It’s just annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to twelve months is a start. And it's good you noticed it’s not constant. You mentioned it happens when you're making a Negroni… does it happen with other fine motor tasks, like writing, eating, or buttoning a shirt?
PATIENT: Buttoning a shirt? Now you're just being ridiculous. I have people for that! But...eating, yeah, sometimes. Especially soup. A little messy, you know? Writing… haven't done that in years, to be frank. Too much typing these days. Everything is on these blasted computers. Still, it's when I'm doing something, with my hands, that it bothers me. Not just sitting around, which, frankly, is most of my time these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be activity-related. And it's primarily affecting your hands. Any pain associated with the shaking, Jerrel?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just… frustrating. Makes me look like a fool, you know? Especially when I'm trying to impress someone. Which, admittedly, doesn't happen often anymore. No, no pain, just… a nuisance. A big, shaky nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain is good. Have you noticed anything else that seems to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Coffee, maybe? I like a strong cup in the morning, always have. And when I'm stressed. Though, what isn't stressful these days? Better? When I'm sitting still, like I said. And, uh... a good glass of wine. Doesn't cure it, but it helps me ignore it. You got a problem with that, Doc?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Jerrel. Perfectly reasonable coping mechanisms! Coffee and stress can definitely play a role. Now, let's go through some other things to get a better picture. Do you have any family history of shaking, tremor, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological… what now? Look, my family was Italian. We had good food, loud voices, and… well, that’s about it. No one was ever… shaking uncontrollably or anything. My mother had arthritis in her hands, maybe? But that was just old age, like I said. I doubt that’s relevant. Honestly, Doc, I'm not much for remembering all that family history stuff. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Jerrel. We can work with what you remember. No known tremor or neurological conditions in the family is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think... I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little blue pill, every morning. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, a half a Valium. Nothing else. I did try one of those turmeric supplements a few years ago, but it tasted awful, so I stopped. Why? Is this important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's important, Jerrel. The blood pressure medication is good to know, and Valium, even occasional use, can sometimes contribute to tremor. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens no. I eat everything. I am Italian, remember? Though I once had a bad reaction to some shellfish… years ago. But that was probably just bad shellfish. Not an allergy. As for medications… I’ve never had a problem with any of them. I just want this shaking to stop, Doc. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Okay, shellfish reaction noted – we'll put that in your record. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just going to check your reflexes, coordination, and see if I can get a sense of the tremor myself. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it. But don't poke me too much. And be gentle, alright? I bruise easily these days. Just… hurry up. I have a lunch appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jerrel. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's just have you extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Okay, I'm seeing a tremor in both hands, more pronounced at rest. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn't uncommon at your age, and your coordination is a little off, but not significantly. I’m also noting a slight rigidity in your arms. Your gait seems stable, but a bit slow. Alright, that gives me a bit more information.
PATIENT: Rigidity? What does that even mean? Look, Doc, are you telling me I’m… falling apart? Is this serious? I just want a pill to stop the shaking, not a list of things that are wrong with me! I'm an old man, I expect a little wear and tear, but…
DOCTOR: Jerrel, let's not jump to conclusions. "Rigidity" just means a slight stiffness in your muscles. It doesn't mean you're falling apart! It's a finding, not a diagnosis. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings - the tremor at rest, the rigidity, the somewhat slow movement - it could be a condition called essential tremor, which is very common, especially with age. However, it could also be a very mild form of Parkinson's disease. It’s too early to tell definitively without some further testing. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a blood test to rule out any other potential causes. And I think it would be helpful to get a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? More tests? This is ridiculous! I just want a simple answer, and a simple solution. Blood tests, fine, whatever. But a neurologist? Is that absolutely necessary? What will they do, poke around in my brain? This sounds… invasive. And Parkinson’s? Is that… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jerrel. It doesn’t sound appealing to go through more appointments and tests, and I apologize for that. A neurologist is the specialist best equipped to properly diagnose the cause of your tremor and rule out anything more serious. They have specialized tools and expertise. Yes, Parkinson's disease can be serious, but it’s also manageable, especially when diagnosed early. There are medications and therapies that can significantly improve quality of life. But, again, we don't know if that's what you have. The blood test will help us rule out other possibilities, and the neurologist will conduct a more thorough examination to determine the exact cause of your tremor. It’s better to be thorough and have a clear understanding of what’s going on, so we can create the best possible plan for you. I can write you a referral today. Would you like me to help you schedule the appointment with the neurologist?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do what you think is best. Just… get it over with. Write the referral. And, if you could, get me the name of someone… patient. Not one of those young ones who think they know everything. Someone who actually listens. And if it is just essential tremor, do you have any of those pills you mentioned? I'd rather skip the neurologist if possible. Honestly, this is a whole lot of fuss over a little shaking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jerrel. I understand your preference, and I’ll do my best to find a neurologist who meets your criteria – experienced and a good listener. I’m referring you to Dr. Eleanor Vance; she has excellent reviews and is known for her patient communication. I’ll have my staff print out the referral information with her contact details and instructions for scheduling an appointment. In the meantime, for the essential tremor, there are medications like propranolol or primidone that can help reduce the shaking. However, they do have potential side effects, and we need to consider your blood pressure before prescribing anything. Since you're already on medication for blood pressure, I’ll hold off on prescribing anything right now until we get the results of the blood tests and have a more definitive diagnosis. We can also discuss lifestyle adjustments, like reducing caffeine intake and stress management techniques, which can sometimes help alleviate the symptoms. Here's some information to review. I’ll have my staff call you with the blood test results in a few days. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Just get this over with. I have a lunch appointment, remember? And tell your staff to hurry with those tests. Honestly, a whole afternoon wasted over a little shaking. I should have just ignored it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Jerrel. I understand your frustration. We'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. My staff will be in touch with the results soon. Have a good lunch, and try to relax. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
