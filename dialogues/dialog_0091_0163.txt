DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure indeed. Well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve gotten myself into a bit of a…culinary predicament, shall we say. I've been attempting a rather...strict diet, and I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I potentially do myself any harm. It’s all rather modern, you see. One reads so much online these days.
DOCTOR: I see. A dietary change, prompted by information you've found online. That’s quite common, Mr. Vantine. It's always wise to seek medical guidance when making significant changes to your eating habits, particularly at your age. To understand the situation fully, could you describe this diet to me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s called the…well, the “Lunar Cycle Detox,” I believe it was named. The premise is rather…peculiar. One only consumes foods that are “in season” according to the phases of the moon. Apparently, each phase aligns with different nutritional needs. For instance, during the new moon, one is limited to root vegetables and bone broth. During the full moon, it’s solely fruits…very specific fruits, mind you. And then there's a rather complicated restriction on protein sources depending on astrological signs. It’s…quite involved. I’ve been at it for three weeks now, and I confess, I feel rather weak.
DOCTOR: The Lunar Cycle Detox, you say. I am not familiar with that particular regimen. It sounds…restrictive, to say the least. And you've been following it for three weeks, experiencing some weakness. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me what a typical day’s meals look like on this diet?
PATIENT: A typical day…well, it varies, Doctor, depending on Luna’s position, naturally. But let’s take yesterday as an example. It was…the waning gibbous, if I recall correctly. Breakfast was a single small parsnip, boiled, with a teaspoon of olive oil. Lunch was a rather meager portion of beetroot and a few sprigs of parsley. And dinner…dinner was a small pear and a cup of chamomile tea. It’s…rather lacking in substance, I must admit. And the hunger…the hunger is quite persistent. I've tried to supplement with a few almonds, but the website expressly forbids it during the waning phases. Something about disrupting the “energetic flow,” I believe.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Vantine. That is a very restrictive diet, and it sounds like you’re not getting adequate nutrition. A single parsnip, beetroot and a pear for a full day…that is concerning. To assess the impact this diet is having on your health, I’d like to ask a few questions about any symptoms you’re experiencing. Beyond the weakness you mentioned, have you noticed any dizziness, fatigue, changes in your bowel habits, muscle cramps, or any difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Well, the weakness is, of course, the most prominent. But you’re right to ask. I have noticed a certain…lightheadedness, particularly when I stand up too quickly. And yes, fatigue. A constant, nagging fatigue. I find myself napping in the afternoons, something I haven’t done since…well, since my university days. As for bowel habits…irregular, shall we say. Constipation mostly, which is rather unpleasant. And yes, muscle cramps! In my calves, mostly, during the night. It wakes me up. Difficulty concentrating…yes, I’ve found it harder to focus on my work, which is…troubling. I’m a bit of a perfectionist, you see. My animations require a great deal of precision. It’s all rather unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. Vantine. Those symptoms – the weakness, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle cramps – are all consistent with nutritional deficiencies. Given the highly restrictive nature of this diet, and the length of time you’ve been following it, I am concerned about potential electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. I would like to perform a physical examination to assess your overall health. This will include checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and a basic neurological assessment. I’d also like to order some blood tests to evaluate your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count to check for anemia. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds…entirely sensible, Doctor. I rather suspected as much. A thorough examination and some blood tests seem…prudent. Yes, absolutely agreeable. I’ve always believed in a scientific approach to these things. This…Lunar Cycle business was perhaps a momentary lapse in judgment. One gets easily swayed by these online pronouncements, you see. Please, proceed as you deem best. I trust your professional opinion implicitly. I’d be grateful for any guidance you can offer.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad to hear you’re open to a scientific approach. We'll get to the bottom of this. If you’ll follow me, we have an examination room just down the hall. I’ll need to check your vital signs first, and then we can discuss the blood tests in more detail.
PATIENT: Lead the way, Doctor. I’m entirely at your disposal. I must confess, I’m rather relieved to be taking a more…grounded approach to my health. This whole "Lunar Cycle" business was becoming increasingly unsettling. And perhaps a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way, Mr. Vantine. These online trends can be very persuasive, but they often lack a solid scientific basis. The most important thing is that you sought medical attention. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to start with your blood pressure and heart rate. I will also listen to your lungs and heart. Please remove your shoes and socks, and I’ll check your reflexes as well.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Proceed as you wish. I've always been a proponent of thoroughness. One doesn't want to leave anything to chance, you see. I do hope my circulation isn't too compromised. I’ve been relatively sedentary lately, focusing on my animations. It’s rather demanding work, you see. Not exactly a physically strenuous profession.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this time. Heart rate is 78 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please extend your arms and legs. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which could be consistent with mild dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or organomegaly detected. Based on this preliminary examination, it appears we have some signs of dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: A little tenderness, you say? I hadn’t noticed it specifically…though I suppose I’ve been rather preoccupied with feeling generally unwell. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances…that aligns with my suspicions, I suppose. Perhaps restricting oneself to root vegetables and pears wasn’t the most…prudent course of action. I’ve always been rather…easily persuaded by these modern trends. It’s rather foolish of me, I admit. What sort of blood tests are we looking at, exactly? And…will the results be available quickly? I confess, I’m rather eager to get to the bottom of this. And perhaps…begin reintroducing some proper sustenance into my diet.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Mr. Vantine. It’s good that you’re recognizing the issue now. We all fall prey to trends from time to time. The blood tests we’ll be running include a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia and infection, a Basic Metabolic Panel to assess kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a Magnesium level, as magnesium is often depleted with restrictive diets. We’ll also check your Vitamin D level, as it’s common to be deficient, especially with limited sun exposure. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once we have them, we can discuss a plan to rehydrate you and restore your electrolyte balance. We’ll also address any nutritional deficiencies. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – and avoiding any further restrictive dieting. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Anemia, kidney function, electrolytes, Vitamin D…a rather comprehensive assessment, thankfully. That sounds…thorough, Doctor. Excellent. As for allergies…no, none that I'm aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Though I do have a slight aversion to licorice, if one can call that an allergy. It upsets my stomach, you see. But beyond that, no. No medications, no allergies…just a rather foolish inclination towards misguided dietary trends. And perhaps a slight weakness for parsnips. Though I suspect that’s more a symptom than a cause.
DOCTOR: Aversion to licorice is good to know. It's always helpful to have a complete picture. Alright, Mr. Vantine. I’m going to write you a lab order for these tests. The phlebotomist will be just down the hall. Once you’ve had the blood drawn, you can go home and rest. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Here you go. Please let the phlebotomist know if you have any difficulty with the blood draw. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Excellent. Thank you, Doctor. No, I believe that’s all for now. I appreciate your thoroughness and…your patience. I confess, I’ve been rather foolish in this endeavor. But I’m glad to be taking a more sensible approach. I shall see the phlebotomist now. And I promise…no further restrictive diets. At least, not without consulting a medical professional first. Thank you again, Doctor Delacour. I look forward to hearing from you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before we receive the results. And I'm glad to hear you'll be consulting a medical professional before making any further dietary changes. That’s the most sensible approach. Please, take care.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. And thank you again for your assistance.
