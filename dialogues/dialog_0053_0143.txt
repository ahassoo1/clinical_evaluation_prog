DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello Doctor. Well, it's a bit… complicated. My daughter, she… wants a baby. And she thought I should come talk to someone first? Something about making sure everything is okay… before? I don't really understand all of it.
DOCTOR: Right. So your daughter is planning a pregnancy and she wants you checked out?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. She said something about… my health? And… things I need to know. I'm not a young man anymore, you see. And… well, I haven't been to the doctor in a long time. I don't even remember the last time, to be honest. Is this… normal? For me to be here?
DOCTOR: It’s… becoming more common. Preconception health is important for both parents, technically. Though frankly, at your age, it’s less about her having a healthy baby and more about making sure you won't… well, have complications. Let's start with a basic history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… maybe high blood pressure, a long time ago? But I don't really remember taking anything for it. And… no, I don't think I have diabetes. My daughter keeps telling me to eat less sugar, but that's just her. I… I really can't recall being told about any serious illnesses, if that makes sense? It’s all a bit foggy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Possible history of hypertension, unconfirmed." Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. When I was young, a long time ago, I had my appendix out. And… I think I broke my leg once, when I was a boy. They had to put a cast on it. But that was… many years ago. Nothing else, I don't believe. I really don't remember anything else. Sorry. It's… hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: "Appendectomy, childhood leg fracture." Okay. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a tough one. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He died when I was still young. And my mother… she had something with her memory, as she got older. Not sure what it was called. And… my brother, he had cancer, a long time ago. But… that’s all I really remember. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It wasn't really something we did. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Family history of cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancer.” Alright. And what about your social history, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Social… history? What does that mean, exactly? Do you mean… my job? I used to be a Sales Engineer. Now I'm retired. I don't… I don't really go out much these days. I mostly stay at home. I don't drink or smoke, never have. I just… keep to myself. Is that what you're asking about? I’m sorry, I’m not sure I understand.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. Just trying to get a complete picture. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise? No, not really. I used to walk a bit, but my knees aren't what they used to be. Now, I mostly just… sit. I do a bit of gardening sometimes, but that’s about it. It’s not very strenuous, I'm afraid. I try to stay busy, but… mostly indoors. I’m getting old, you see. It’s hard to do the things I used to.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. I used to take something for my heartburn, a long time ago. But I stopped taking it. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D tablet in the winter, because my daughter says I don't get enough sun. But that's about it. Nothing regular, I promise. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They always make me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Just relax. Heart sounds… somewhat diminished, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is… 150/90. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are diminished in the lower extremities. Okay. Given your age, family history, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Also, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Oh dear. Sounds… complicated. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes. Yes, that's alright. I trust your judgement. I just… hope it's not too bad. My daughter will be very upset if something is wrong. Can you tell me what it all means? What are you looking for exactly? I just want to understand what’s going on, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Well, we’re just getting a baseline, Mr. Verrall. The blood work will tell us about your overall health – cholesterol levels, blood sugar to rule out diabetes, kidney function, and make sure you don't have any underlying infections. The EKG is to look at the electrical activity of your heart. It won’t necessarily tell us everything, but it’s a good starting point. We’re checking to see if everything is functioning as it should be. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the EKG. It's a simple test. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and decide if any further action is needed. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Baseline… that makes sense. And the EKG… simple, you said? That's good. I appreciate you explaining it to me, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know what’s going on. I just want to be healthy for my daughter, you see. She's been wanting this for a long time. So, yes, please, let's do the blood work and the EKG. Thank you. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The blood work should be back in a couple of days. The EKG results are usually quicker, within 24 hours. The nurse will contact you when they're available. In the meantime, try not to worry. We’re just being thorough. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, one thing… My daughter mentioned something about… vaccines? Are there any vaccines I should get before… well, before the baby arrives? I don't really know anything about that. And… is there anything I can do to… prepare? Besides the blood work and the EKG, I mean. I just want to be as ready as possible. I’m getting on in years, and I want to make sure I’m not… a risk. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, though frankly, you’re at an age where… many things are a risk. Regarding vaccines, we'll want to ensure you're up-to-date on your tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster. Pertussis, or whooping cough, is particularly important as it can be dangerous for newborns. And a flu shot, of course. We can discuss those today or schedule them for a follow-up appointment after we get the blood work results. As for preparing… maintain a healthy lifestyle. Get enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, and try to reduce stress. That’s about it, really. There's not a lot you can do to fundamentally change things at this point. The blood work will give us a better idea of what to focus on, if anything. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: I think… no. That’s… that's very helpful, Doctor. Vaccines, a healthy lifestyle… and try not to worry. Easier said than done, I suppose. Thank you for being patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient. I just… I want everything to be alright. My daughter deserves a healthy baby, and I want to be a good grandfather. I think that's all for now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will see you now to draw blood and schedule the EKG. Have a good day, Mr. Verrall. .
