DOCTOR: Hi Jase, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski, but you can call me Derell. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Derell, it’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good, lately. Really runny, you know? It’s been going on for a bit, and honestly, I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… a while. It's pretty annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not good” and “runny”... and you said it's been going on for “a while.” Right. It is annoying when things aren't working right. Hmm. When you say "a while," can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the thing. I… I really don't know. A few weeks, maybe? Or was it a month? It feels like it’s been longer, but I honestly can't pinpoint it. My memory's not the best, unfortunately. It's just… been happening, on and off. Sometimes it's worse than others, but it never really goes away completely, you know?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's alright, don't worry about being exact. It happens. “On and off” for a few weeks, maybe a month… Okay. And when it is happening, how many times a day would you say you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That varies a lot. Some days it’s like… three or four times. Other days… more. Like, six or seven, maybe? It really depends on what I’ve eaten, I think. But even when I’m careful, it still happens sometimes. It's just… unpredictable. And it's always… loose. Like, really watery. Sorry if that's… too much information.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s perfectly alright, Jase. We need the details to figure things out. "Loose and watery," and varying from three to seven times a day… Okay. Have you noticed anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. Dairy definitely doesn’t help. And… spicy food, for sure. I love Pakistani food, obviously, but anything really hot makes it much worse. And bread… sometimes bread makes it bad. It’s weird, because I don’t think I have a huge problem with bread normally. It just seems like… when my stomach’s already upset, bread is definitely a trigger. I think. It's hard to say for sure, honestly. Everything messes with it sometimes!
DOCTOR: Right, dairy, spicy food, and sometimes bread seem to be triggers, especially when your stomach is already upset. Okay. And are you having any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but I always figured that was just from… everything. And my stomach… it kinda hurts sometimes. Not like, really bad pain, but just… uncomfortable. Bloated, you know? And I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot, so… yeah. I guess those are the main things. No fever or anything like that. Nothing major, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, some bloating and discomfort, but no fever. Alright. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Oh, um… no, not that I’ve seen. I always check, because… well, you know. But no blood. And it's definitely not black or anything like that. It's just… watery. Like I said. I guess I haven't noticed anything really worrying, just… really annoying. I just wanted to get it checked out, in case it was something serious. My husband thought it was a good idea.
DOCTOR: Good, no blood or black stools. That's helpful. And it's good you're getting it checked out, and that your husband encouraged you to come in. Okay, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I think I have something with my stomach, but I can't remember what it's called. Something about… not being able to eat certain things? The doctor told me a long time ago, but I was young and I didn’t really pay attention. I think it might be something with gluten? Or… something like that. My husband thinks it's celiac, maybe? I have to be careful about what I eat, I know that much. And I think they said something about my bowels, but I honestly can't remember the details. Sorry, I’m really bad at this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Jase. Don't apologize! It sounds like there might be a history of some kind of food intolerance or digestive issue. Something about gluten or your bowels… Okay. Do you remember approximately when you were diagnosed with this, or how old you were?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is so frustrating! I really wish I could remember. I think… maybe when I was a teenager? So, like, fifteen or sixteen? Or maybe a little older. It was a long time ago. I remember having tests done, and the doctor telling me I had to be careful about what I ate. But honestly, I just tried to avoid anything that made me sick. I never really paid much attention to the details of the diagnosis. My husband is much better at remembering things like that. He’s probably right about it being celiac.
DOCTOR: Okay, possibly diagnosed with something around age fifteen or sixteen, and your husband suspects it might be celiac disease. We can definitely look into that further. Do you know if you've ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Never. Not even tonsils, or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I've always been pretty healthy, except for this stomach thing, obviously. It’s just… this has been going on for so long, and it’s just getting worse. And I can't remember the details of anything, which makes it even more frustrating! I feel like I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being helpful, Jase. It's okay that you can't remember everything. It's more common than you think. No surgeries, that's good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mom has high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he has diabetes, I’m pretty sure. And my aunt, on my mom’s side, she has something with her stomach, but I don’t know what it is. Something about… not being able to digest things properly? She’s always complaining about bloating and gas, and she has to be really careful about what she eats. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. I don’t know much about my family’s medical history, unfortunately. It's not really something we talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and diabetes in your parents, and potentially a digestive issue in your aunt. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, except for the things that upset my stomach, obviously. But that's not an allergy, right? Just… sensitivity? I’m really bad at this. I feel like I'm not giving you enough information. But I honestly can't remember anything! It’s just… a blur.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing fine, Jase. It’s alright that it’s a blur. You're not required to be a medical historian! No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking any medications. Not even vitamins, or anything. I try to eat healthy, so I don't really need them. I haven't needed anything for my stomach either, because I just try to avoid the things that bother me. I know I should probably be doing something, but I haven’t really bothered. I guess I just thought it would go away on its own. But it hasn’t, obviously. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Alright, Jase, that gives me a good starting point. Let me just pull up your EHR information here… okay, I see some notes from Dr. Sharma, from about ten years ago, mentioning possible Irritable Bowel Syndrome. And there is a note about a possible gluten sensitivity… yes, here we go. It looks like you had some testing done, and it wasn't conclusive, but Dr. Sharma recommended a trial of a gluten-free diet. It seems like that might be worth exploring further. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Can I listen to your abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. That… that explains why it sounded familiar. Dr. Sharma! I completely forgot about her. A gluten-free diet… yeah, I think I tried that for a little while, but I don’t remember if it helped. It's all so long ago. Sure, go ahead. Listening to my abdomen is fine. I hope you find something. I just want to figure out what's going on. It's really frustrating, living like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, just going to press here, and here… Any tenderness or pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's just… uncomfortable, sometimes. Like a dull ache, but it's not sharp or anything. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… my stomach always feels a bit weird. I guess that’s normal for me. It's not a sudden pain, or anything. Just a constant, low-level discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, some low-level discomfort, but no sharp pain. Bowel sounds are… present, but a little bit hyperactive. That’s not surprising, given your symptoms. No murmurs or anything concerning. Okay, everything sounds fairly normal, at least on initial assessment. Given your history, the notes from Dr. Sharma, and your symptoms, I think we need to investigate the possibility of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or potentially celiac disease, further. What do you think?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… right. I mean, whatever it is, it's clearly something with my stomach. And if it's something like celiac, maybe I should actually try the gluten-free diet properly this time? I kind of just gave up on it before, because I didn't see results right away. I’m just… worried about having to change my whole diet. I love Pakistani food! But I guess I’ll do whatever it takes to feel better. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: I understand. Changing your diet is a big commitment, especially with a cuisine you enjoy. We don’t have to jump into a strict gluten-free diet immediately. What I recommend is starting with a trial of a low-FODMAP diet for a few weeks. It’s a little less restrictive than gluten-free, and can help identify if certain carbohydrates are triggering your symptoms. We can also order some blood tests to rule out celiac disease. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: A low-FODMAP diet… okay. That sounds… less scary than just cutting out gluten completely. And blood tests are fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. So, blood tests and a low-FODMAP diet? Can you give me some information about what I can and can’t eat? Because honestly, I have no idea what FODMAPs even are. And are there any side effects to the blood tests? I always get nervous about needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's start with the blood tests. They're pretty standard – just a routine blood draw. You might feel a little pinch, but it's usually over very quickly. There's very little risk of side effects, maybe a little bruising at the injection site. We’ll also check your vitamin levels, as prolonged diarrhea can sometimes lead to deficiencies. As for the low-FODMAP diet, it's a little complicated, but I can give you a handout with a list of high-FODMAP foods to avoid, and low-FODMAP alternatives. Essentially, it's about temporarily reducing certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult to digest. Foods like onions, garlic, apples, pears, wheat, and dairy are high-FODMAP, while things like bananas, blueberries, carrots, and rice are generally low-FODMAP. We can also refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you create a meal plan and ensure you're getting adequate nutrition. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Blood tests and a handout… and maybe a dietitian. A dietitian would be really helpful, actually. I’m terrible at planning meals, and I definitely don’t want to accidentally eat something that will make me sick. When would I get the blood test results? And how long do I have to stay on the low-FODMAP diet? I have a wedding coming up next month, and I don't want to be stuck on a weird diet during the celebrations.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll order the blood tests now. They should be processed within a week or so, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. As for the low-FODMAP diet, we typically recommend a trial of 2-6 weeks. That's enough time to see if it's making a difference in your symptoms. We can certainly adjust the timeline to accommodate your wedding. Perhaps start the diet now, and then reintroduce foods gradually after the celebrations, to see if anything triggers your symptoms?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, actually. Start now, and then ease back into things after the wedding. That way I can actually enjoy the food at the reception, without worrying about getting sick. Okay, so blood tests, a handout, and a dietitian referral. And start the low-FODMAP diet now. Is there anything else I need to know? Or are we all set for now? I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot less overwhelmed than I did before.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Just one more thing: it's important to stay hydrated while on the low-FODMAP diet, as some of the allowed foods are high in water content. And if your symptoms worsen at any point, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I'm going to print out the handout now, and I'll send the dietitian referral electronically. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions before I let you get going?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Stay hydrated and contact you if things get worse… got it. Thank you so much, Dr. Polczynski. I really appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to feeling better, and hopefully enjoying some Pakistani food again soon! .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad we have a plan. And I hope you do get to enjoy some Pakistani food soon! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be right in. Take care! .
