DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, things have been… slipping. My memory, that is. It is concerning. And my blood pressure… it is often high. I thought it best to have someone look at both, together.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Ms. Alvara. It’s certainly wise to address both of those concerns. “Slipping” can mean a lot of things, so let’s start with your memory. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… difficult to explain precisely. Small things, mostly. I will go to put the kettle on, and forget why I went to the kitchen. Or I will speak with a neighbor, and the details… the specifics of our conversation… vanish almost immediately. Important things, like appointments… I write them down, you understand. But even then, sometimes I look at the paper and… it feels distant. Not gone, exactly. Just… not present. It is unsettling. And it seems to be… worse lately.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. That sounds quite frustrating and unsettling. It’s good you’re recognizing these changes and seeking medical attention. It's helpful that you've noticed it's worsening recently. To help me get a better understanding, can you tell me about how long you’ve been experiencing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Perhaps… six months? It began gradually, I think. At first, I dismissed it. Everyone forgets things, yes? But it has been… steadily increasing. Six months seems… right. Maybe a little longer. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly. My husband… he passed away two years ago, and… well, things have been… different since then. Perhaps that has something to do with it. I do not know.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Alvara. Grief can certainly have a significant impact on cognitive function, so that is absolutely something to consider. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, aside from the memory issues and your concern about blood pressure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a long time ago, but it still feels very close. Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes, I feel… a little clumsy. I bump into things more often than I used to. And I find it difficult to… find the right words. Not often, but it happens. It is frustrating. And I have been… more tired lately. Not just from lack of sleep, but… a deep fatigue. It is… difficult to describe. Like a weight, always present. And… oh. Sometimes my head aches. Not a severe headache, just… a dull pressure. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That is all relevant, Ms. Alvara, thank you for sharing that with me. The clumsiness, difficulty finding words, fatigue, and headaches could all be contributing factors, or related to the same underlying cause. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Just the… high blood pressure, Doctor. It has been… managed, for many years, with medication. But it has been… less responsive lately. My doctor increased the dosage a few months ago, but it still… fluctuates. Other than that… no. No diabetes, no heart disease. I had… a difficult birth with my son, many years ago. But I recovered fully, as far as I know. And I have never been… seriously ill. A few colds, a few infections… but nothing of consequence. I am generally… a healthy person. Or, I was. Before all of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Only a tonsillectomy when I was a child, Doctor. A very long time ago. And… a small procedure on my knee, perhaps ten years ago. A sports injury, from skiing. Nothing… major. No significant operations. I have always… avoided hospitals, if possible. I prefer to stay… active. To keep moving.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Of course. I take… Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams, once daily. And… sometimes, Ibuprofen, for aches and pains. Only as needed, you understand. Perhaps two or three times a month. And… a multivitamin. Just a standard one, to… supplement my diet. I try to eat healthily, but… it is not always possible. And… that is all, Doctor. I do not take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have eaten… everything, during my life. And I have never had a reaction to any medication. I have been… fortunate, in that regard. I do not like to take pills, you understand, so I am careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… it is… complicated. My mother… she lived to a very old age. Ninety-two, I believe. She had… some memory problems in her later years, but it was dismissed as… old age. No one took it seriously. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. He also had… some problems with his heart, later in life. His memory… I do not recall any significant issues with his memory, specifically. But there was… a history of heart disease, on both sides of the family. That is… as much as I know. We were… not a close family, you understand.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a neurological assessment – checking your reflexes, balance, and some basic cognitive function. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I understand. The sooner we know… the better. Please, proceed. I will do my best to… cooperate. I may be a little… unsteady, perhaps, but I will try.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here for me, we'll start with your blood pressure. Alright, Ms. Alvara, just relax your arm for me… and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 158 over 92. We'll need to keep a closer eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Finally, let's do a quick neurological assessment. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Very well. It is… not surprising, perhaps. My blood pressure has been… difficult to control, as I mentioned. I am following it, Doctor. I believe I am… able to track it without difficulty. It is a little… tiring, perhaps, but I am doing my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Good eye tracking. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… It is… August… the second, is it not? Yes. August second, 2025. I believe that is correct. Yes. August second.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Remember them, and I'll ask you to repeat them back in a few minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me now.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. I have them. It is… a simple task, I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, can you tell me what year we are currently in?
PATIENT: We are… currently in the year 2025, Doctor. Is that correct? It… feels strange to say it aloud. The years pass so quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, can you please tell me who the current President of the United States is?
PATIENT: The President… Oh dear. That is… a difficult question. I… I know his name… it begins with a ‘B’… But I cannot recall it precisely. It is on the tip of my tongue… I am very sorry. I should know this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s not a test, and it’s common to have difficulty recalling names. Now, let’s move on to a simple balance test. Could you please stand up and try to balance on one foot for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Oh dear… This is… more difficult than I anticipated. I am afraid I cannot maintain my balance for 30 seconds. I am… unsteady.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. Please, sit back down. Okay, thank you. And finally, let’s revisit those three words I asked you to remember. Can you repeat them for me, please?
PATIENT: Three words… Apple… and… table… Oh dear. I… I cannot recall the third word. It is… just beyond my grasp. I am very sorry, Doctor. I remember apple and table… but the third one… it has vanished.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. Don't worry about it. Based on what you’ve told me about your symptoms – the memory loss, difficulty finding words, fatigue, headaches, and the results of this brief neurological exam, along with your elevated blood pressure, I'm concerned about possible cognitive impairment. However, it’s important to determine the underlying cause. There are many possibilities, including medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, depression, or early stages of dementia. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and other potential issues. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and possibly an MRI of the brain. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a neurologist? Yes, Doctor. If it will help… if it will tell us what is happening… then yes, please. Do whatever is necessary. I want to understand. I am… frightened, to be honest. But I trust your judgment. Please, proceed with the tests and the referral.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. I understand your concern, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I'll write you a lab order for the blood tests now. You can get those done at the lab across the street. The results usually take a few days. I'll also get the referral to Dr. Chen, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it’s important to continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. Please avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you are feeling particularly unsteady or experiencing difficulty with your memory. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as confusion, weakness, or speech difficulties, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen… I will remember that name. No… no, I think not, at this moment. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Continue taking the Lisinopril… avoid driving… remember Dr. Chen… Thank you… thank you very much. For your kindness… and for listening. I appreciate it more than words can say. I… I will await Dr. Chen’s call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Chen. Take care, and I wish you all the best. .
