DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. My nails... they just look funny. Not good funny. They changed. That's why I'm here. I don't really... remember when they started, exactly. Just... changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, “changed” – can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Um... well, they're kinda... yellow. And thick. Not like, really thick, but not normal. And one of them... I think it's lifting up a little? Like, not stuck on all the way. It's just... gross. I keep tryin' to paint over it, but it doesn't help. It just looks worse. Honestly, I don't know what's going on with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing and thickening, and lifting—that gives me a better idea. And you’ve noticed this happening over… how long now, roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh, time... I dunno. Months, maybe? I really don't keep track of that stuff. It just kinda... happened while I was busy. I work a lot, you know? People need their ears checked. It's important. Longer than a couple of weeks, definitely. Not that long, though. Maybe... six months? Something like that. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months is helpful. And do you do anything with your hands regularly that might be contributing to this – like a lot of gardening, cleaning, or using harsh chemicals?
PATIENT: Chemicals? Oh, no. I’m an audiologist! I use… little ear things. And gloves, of course. Always gloves. Cleaning... yeah, I clean. But not like, really clean. Just normal stuff. Dusting, you know? I don't go around scrubbin' toilets or anything. Gardening... not since my mother passed. She liked that. I don't see how that would have anything to do with it. My nails just changed. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails, or any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… sensitive sometimes, when I tap 'em. But not pain. And the skin... hmmm. It doesn't look different. Maybe a little dry? But I put lotion on. I always put lotion on. I don't know. It's probably just dry skin. Everything's dry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical conditions, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, conditions... well, I get tired. Is that a condition? And my back hurts sometimes. Everyone's back hurts, though, right? Medications... let me think. Just... vitamins. A multivitamin. And sometimes I take something for my... sinuses. When they act up. I can't remember the name. It's a little red pill. That's all. I have Medicare, so they keep track of stuff, you know? They'd tell you if there was anything important.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's helpful. Now, would you mind if I took a closer look at your nails?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. They’re probably just ugly. I don't understand why I even bother comin' to the doctor for somethin' like this. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some definite discoloration and thickening here, and a little bit of onycholysis – that’s the lifting of the nail. It doesn’t appear inflamed, which is good. Based on this appearance, it’s likely a fungal infection. It's pretty common. It doesn't typically cause pain until it gets severe. We can do a quick test to confirm, or we can go ahead and start treatment—it takes a few months to see results either way. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Fungus? Ugh. Like… dirt fungus? That's disgusting. I don't like that. I keep my hands clean! Are you sure? Maybe it's just… old age. My mother’s nails were kinda like that too. Treatment... what kind of treatment? Do I have to take pills? I don't like taking pills. And months?! I have patients to see! I don’t know... is there somethin’ I can put on it? A cream or somethin’? Fast?
DOCTOR: It's not "dirt fungus," exactly. It’s a common type of fungal infection that thrives in warm, moist environments. It’s not a reflection of your cleanliness at all. It can happen to anyone. We could do a nail clipping test to confirm, which would take about a week to get results. As for treatment, there are topical medications – creams and lacquers – that we can try first. They do take several months to work, as the fungus grows slowly, but they're generally well-tolerated. Oral medication is also an option, but you're right, it does come with potential side effects, so we usually start with topical treatments first. We can try a topical antifungal cream for 8-12 weeks and see if that helps. It's applied daily. It’s not a quick fix, unfortunately, but it’s the least invasive option. We’d reassess in three months to see if there’s improvement. What do you think about trying that first?
PATIENT: Hmm... three months. That's still a long time. Fine. But if it doesn’t work, I’m not comin’ back. And I don't want any of those nasty pills. Promise? Just the cream. And tell me how to put it on. I don't want to mess it up. I have important work to do, you know? Can't be wastin' time dealin' with fungus.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll stick to the topical cream. No pills unless it’s absolutely necessary, and even then, we’ll discuss all the risks and benefits. Here’s how you apply it: First, you’ll need to trim your nails as short as possible – straight across, not rounded. Then, file the surface of the affected nail gently to remove any thick, flaky debris. After that, you’ll apply a thin layer of the cream to the entire nail and surrounding skin, once or twice a day, just like you’d apply lotion. It's important to be consistent, even if you don’t see immediate results. I'm going to write you a prescription for the cream and provide you with a handout detailing the application instructions. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today to check on your progress. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Trim... file... cream... It sounds like a lot of work. Okay. Three months. Fine. Will it… spread to my other nails? That's what I’m really worried about. My hands are how I make a livin'. And do I need to wear gloves or anything? I don't want to get it on my patients! That would be awful.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. It can spread, but that’s why consistent treatment is so important. Keeping your nails trimmed and applying the medication regularly will help prevent that. As for your patients, it’s unlikely to be contagious through casual contact. But to be extra cautious, I recommend wearing gloves during examinations, especially if you have any open cuts or abrasions on your hands. We can also discuss using a hand sanitizer regularly. It's important to remember that fungal infections aren't usually painful, and it’s highly unlikely your patients would be affected. But I understand your concern and want you to feel comfortable and confident. Do you feel alright with wearing gloves as a precaution?
PATIENT: Gloves… yeah, I can do that. I already wear them most of the time, anyway. Okay. So, trim, file, cream, gloves, and don't get it on my patients. Is that everything? I have a lot of appointments this afternoon, you know. I think I have it all. Hopefully, this stuff actually works. I don’t like comin’ to doctors. It just takes up my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sums it up perfectly. Trim, file, apply the cream consistently, wear gloves as a precaution, and try not to worry too much. I’ve written you a prescription for the cream, and the handout has detailed instructions. My office number is on the prescription if you have any questions or concerns. I’m glad we were able to come up with a plan that you’re comfortable with. I’ll see you in three months. Have a good afternoon, and good luck with your appointments!
PATIENT: Yeah, you too. Hopefully, this is the end of it.
