DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur, trying to remember everything. Something about my hearing, and… feeling dizzy? My daughter, Lani, she made the appointment. Said I've been mentioning it a lot. And something about my father… he had similar problems, I think. It all feels a bit foggy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's very common to feel that way when you're concerned about your health. We’ll take our time and try to sort everything out. So, let's start with the hearing and dizziness. When did you first notice these issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice? That’s… a good question. Not recently, I don't think. It comes and goes, you see? It's not constant. Maybe a few months ago? It’s hard to pinpoint. It feels like it happens when I'm… tired, maybe? Or stressed? It’s just a fleeting thing, usually. A whooshing sound, and then a bit unsteady on my feet. Nothing major, usually. But Lani worried, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of intermittent hearing changes and dizziness, more noticeable when tired or stressed. The whooshing sound is good information - that could be what we call tinnitus. And the dizziness, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Tinnitus… is that a fancy word for the whooshing? Well, the dizziness… it’s not like I’m falling over, Doctor. It’s more… off balance. Like the room is spinning a little, but not really. Hard to explain. It’s just a… shaky feeling. And it doesn’t last long, usually. A few seconds, maybe a minute. Then it just… goes away. It’s quite unsettling when it happens, though. Especially when I'm trying to do things around the house. You know, cooking, cleaning... things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent tinnitus – that whooshing sound – and episodes of vertigo – that feeling of being off balance or the room spinning – lasting seconds to a minute. That gives us a better picture. Now, has anything specific triggered these episodes that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Triggered…? That’s… a tricky one. Not that I can recall, specifically. I mean, like I said, when I’m tired or stressed, maybe. But just normal tired, you know? Or a bit worried about something. Not like a big event or anything. Sometimes… when I've been on my feet a lot? That might bring it on. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been doing as much lately. Perhaps that’s it? Honestly, it feels random most of the time. It’s just… there sometimes. And then it’s not. I wish I could pinpoint something. It would be helpful, wouldn't it?
DOCTOR: It would be helpful, but it sounds like it’s not always predictable, and that’s okay. We’ll explore some possibilities. Now, let’s back up a bit. You mentioned your father had similar problems. Do you know what he experienced, or what, if anything, he did about it?
PATIENT: Oh, my father… He was a strong man, my father. He used to work on the boats, you know? Very active. He had… what was it called? Meniere’s disease, I think? Lani told me. Something about the inner ear. He used to get terrible dizziness, and a ringing in his ears. He went to a specialist, a long time ago. They gave him some medicine, and told him to watch his salt intake. It helped, I think, but he still had episodes sometimes. It was a long time ago, though. I don't remember the details very well. It was… upsetting to see him suffer, that's all I really remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Meniere’s disease in your father. That's helpful information, as it does run in families sometimes. Now, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have… well, I'm on Medicare, so I must have something, right? Just the usual aches and pains, I suppose, for someone my age. A bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. And my doctor… Dr. Patel, she used to monitor my blood pressure. It was a little high a few years ago, but it seemed to be okay last time she checked. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor very often. I don’t like bothering people.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis and previously elevated blood pressure that was stable at last check. That’s good to know. And you don't bother me at all, Terasa; that's what I'm here for. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from anything you might take for aches and pains?
PATIENT: Oh… Let me see… This, perhaps? It’s just for my hands. Some cream for the arthritis. It's… diclofenac, I think. And sometimes… if I’m really struggling to sleep, I’ll take a… a sleeping tablet. Just one, occasionally. Lani gets them for me. She worries, you see. I don't really like taking anything, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, diclofenac cream for your arthritis and an occasional sleeping tablet. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat most things. I used to get a bit of a rash sometimes, when I was a child, from mosquito bites, but that’s all. Nothing serious. Lani always asks me if I'm allergic to anything before she gives me anything, and I always say no. She's very careful. She’s a good daughter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's excellent. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he used to smoke a little, when he was younger, but I always told him it was a terrible habit. And he stopped, eventually. He was a good man. I just don't like the smell of it, you know? It's… unpleasant. And very unhealthy. I always tried to live a healthy life, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. That’s great. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. Or a small sherry. I don’t drink very often, though. Not like some people! I prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest. It’s more relaxing. And it doesn’t upset my stomach. Just a little, Doctor. Nothing to worry about. It’s not a habit, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional light alcohol consumption. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Well, my diet… it’s not very exciting, I’m afraid. Mostly fish and vegetables. I try to eat healthy, like I said, but I don’t do a lot of cooking for myself anymore. It’s just easier to have something simple. Soup, or a sandwich. And fruit, sometimes. As for exercise… Not much, I’m afraid! I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I walk to the shops sometimes, if the weather is nice. But that’s about it. I mostly just… rest. It’s not a very active life, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diet primarily of fish and vegetables with limited exercise. Thank you for being so open with me, Terasa. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your ears, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. That will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That’s fine. Do whatever you need to do. I just… hope you can find out what’s wrong. It’s just… unsettling, you know? This dizziness, and the whooshing… It makes me feel… off balance. Like something isn't quite right. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. We'll take it slowly. First, I’m going to take a look in your ears with this instrument. It's called an otoscope. It doesn't hurt, but it might feel a little cool. Okay… the ear canal looks clear. There's some cerumen, or earwax, but nothing unusual. Now I’ll check your right ear. Okay, the right ear also looks clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It helps me listen for any unusual sounds. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your balance and coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Is this… alright? I feel a little… strange, looking like this. It makes me a bit dizzy, if I concentrate too hard. But I’m trying, Doctor. I really am. Just… let me know if I’m doing it wrong. It’s just… hard to focus, sometimes. I hope I’m not making a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Terasa. No need to worry at all. There’s a slight nystagmus – that’s an involuntary movement of the eyes – but it’s subtle. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers and toes. This checks your sensation. Okay… sensation is intact. And finally, I'd like you to try and stand on one leg for a few seconds. Just whichever leg feels more comfortable. Okay… a little unsteady, but able to maintain balance for a few seconds. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation, Terasa. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, it could be a few things. Given your father's history, and your symptoms of tinnitus and dizziness, Meniere’s disease is certainly something we need to consider. However, we need to rule out other possibilities as well.
PATIENT: Oh dear… Meniere’s disease…? Is that… serious? Will I… will I end up like my father? He suffered so much. I don’t want to end up like him, Doctor. I just want to… feel normal again. What… what do we do now? What kind of tests do I need? And… will it take long to find out? I just… I want to know what’s wrong, and what can be done about it.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Terasa. It’s good that we’re exploring this now. Meniere’s disease can be debilitating, but it’s also manageable with treatment. Not everyone experiences the same severity of symptoms, and there are a variety of options to help control them. First, I’d like to order an audiogram – that's a hearing test – to assess your hearing loss. We’ll also do a vestibular function test to evaluate the inner ear balance system. I’m also going to order some blood work to rule out other possible causes of your dizziness, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on, and help us determine the best course of action. The audiogram and vestibular tests can usually be scheduled within the next week or so. The blood work can be done today, if you’d like. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and get plenty of rest. We can also discuss some medications to help manage your symptoms, such as anti-vertigo medications if the dizziness becomes severe. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds alright, Doctor. Tests… and medications… It’s a lot to take in. But… I suppose it’s better to know, than to just sit here and worry. The blood work today, then. And the tests… next week. I hope they don't take too long. I just… I want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. And… the medications… are they… safe? Will they have side effects? I don’t want to feel even worse, you know? I just… I want to be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take everything one step at a time. The blood work is relatively straightforward and helps rule out other potential causes. As for the medications, the anti-vertigo medications can have some side effects, such as drowsiness or dizziness, but they are generally well-tolerated. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. If you experience any side effects, we can always adjust the dose or try a different medication. I'm also going to give you a referral to an audiologist – that’s a hearing specialist – who can perform the audiogram and discuss hearing aids if necessary. They’ll be able to provide you with more detailed information about your hearing loss and options for managing it. Here's what I'm going to do: I'll have the nurse draw some blood for the lab work. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Emily Carter, the audiologist. And I'll have my medical assistant schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the test results and the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any severe dizziness or hearing loss, or if you develop any other concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds like a plan, Doctor. Dr. Carter… and the follow-up appointment. And… call if anything gets worse. I will. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was so worried before, but… I feel a little better now, knowing that we’re doing something about it. I just… I hope the tests don’t show anything too serious. But… thank you again, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. That’s what I’m here for. It's completely understandable to be anxious about the tests, but try not to worry too much until we have the results. We’ll face whatever comes, together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very good and will make you as comfortable as possible. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Terasa?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and… you’ve put my mind at ease. I just… I just want to get this sorted out, and get back to normal. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I'll… I'll see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Have a good day, Terasa. .
