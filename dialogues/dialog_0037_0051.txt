DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. NINI. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what did bring me in? Now, let me see… It’s something about… the blood. Yes, that’s it! I need to know what kind of blood I have. My… someone told me it was important to know. For… things. It’s all a bit foggy, you see. I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. NINI. Knowing your blood type can be helpful, and it's good you're thinking ahead. Just to clarify, were you told this by a medical professional, or by a family member or friend?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It wasn’t… a doctor, I don’t think. More like… a friend of a friend? Maybe? Everyone was talking about it at… a gathering, I believe. Yes, a gathering. Such a lot of faces. I’m afraid I don't recall who exactly told me. It was important enough that I came all this way, though!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. NINI. It’s common for information to get passed around. Knowing your blood type is a good idea, regardless of how you heard about it. We can certainly check that for you. To get a better understanding of why you’re concerned, can you tell me what “things” you were referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… “things.” That’s what I said, wasn’t it? Well… it had to do with… emergencies, I think. And… helping people. My husband… he used to say it was important to be prepared. He was a… a strong man, always thinking ahead. Yes, preparing for… if something happened. He always said, “Be ready, NINI, always be ready.” I just want to do as he would have wanted.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Ms. NINI. It's wonderful that you're remembering your husband and wanting to honor his wishes. Knowing your blood type is important in emergency situations, and can be helpful if you ever need a blood transfusion or if you want to donate blood. Before we proceed with the blood type test, I’d like to ask a few routine questions, if you don’t mind. It helps me get a fuller picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Ask away. I don't mind at all. Though, be warned… my memory isn't what it used to be! I might need you to repeat things, if you don’t mind. It’s just… getting old, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. NINI, that’s perfectly alright. I’m happy to repeat anything as many times as needed. We’ll take our time. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… Let me think. I was a rigger, you know. Quite a physical job. Lots of… bumps and bruises, aches and pains. Nothing serious, I don’t think. The doctor… a very nice man, years ago… he said my blood pressure was sometimes a bit high, but he gave me some little pills. I took them for a while. And… oh! My arthritis. Yes, my joints get quite stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. That's about all I can recall. Nothing major, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication, and arthritis. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, the pills… No, I stopped taking those pills a long time ago. The nice doctor… he said I could if I felt alright. And I do feel alright, most days. Just a bit stiff in the mornings, like I said. And… sometimes a little tired. But that's just getting old, isn't it? No, I don’t take anything regularly now. Just a cup of chamomile tea before bed. That helps me sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, just chamomile tea. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh dear. Let me see… There was… a little thing on my arm, years and years ago. The doctor cut it off. A mole, I think. It wasn't serious, just a little snip. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was younger. Working with the rigging, you see. It was a silly accident. They put a cast on it. That's all I can remember, honestly. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mole removal and a broken wrist in the past. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had a bad reaction. I used to love shellfish, but I haven't had it in years. My husband wasn't a fan. And… I don't recall ever being allergic to anything a doctor gave me. But, honestly, dear, I have a terrible memory for things like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. NINI. We can proceed with the assumption that you have no known allergies for now. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That’s a sad thought. No, I’m afraid they’re all gone now. My parents passed away a long time ago, when I was quite young. And my brother… he went to America. I haven’t heard from him in… decades. Such a long time. We weren’t very close, I’m afraid. It's just me now.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear that, Ms. NINI. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that ran in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a hard question. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he had trouble breathing in his later years. But that was a long time ago. I don’t know much about what they really had. We didn't talk about those things much back then. It wasn’t the custom, you see. Just… weak hearts, mostly. And a bit of… rheumatism, maybe? It’s all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright, “weak hearts” and possible rheumatism in the family. That’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he tried it once, when he was a young man, but he didn’t like it. Said it made him cough. No, I’ve never been one for smoking. Always preferred fresh air.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's all. A nice dry sherry, perhaps. Nothing excessive. Just a small treat to enjoy with my food. It helps me relax, you see. But I don't drink every day, only on special occasions. It's not something I need.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little about your current activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I don’t get around like I used to. I live in a small cottage, you see, with a lovely garden. I do a bit of weeding, and some light housework. Mostly, I enjoy sitting in the sun and reading. My knees aren’t what they used to be. I mostly take things slow and easy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. NINI. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, to get back to your original concern—determining your blood type—I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then draw a small sample of blood for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam… and a little poke? I can manage that. I’ve had worse! Just… try not to make it too painful, alright? My skin is a bit thin these days. But yes, let's get this done. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. NINI, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and now exhale. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at the moment. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. And I'll just take a look in your ears. Everything looks good there as well. Now, for the blood draw. We’ll just need a small sample from your arm. Please relax your arm for me… This may feel like a slight pinch.
PATIENT: Oh, a pinch, you say? Alright, I’m bracing myself. Just… don’t poke too deep, dear. And please tell me when it’s done. I don’t like surprises. It’s funny… I used to be so brave when I was rigging, climbing high above the ground… but a little needle… that gets to me! Just hurry and get it over with, alright? I’m trying to be brave…
DOCTOR: Alright, all done, Ms. NINI. Just hold this firmly in place for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. You might have a little bruise later, but it shouldn't be too bad. Now, we'll send this sample to the lab, and the results should be back within a couple of days. I’ll have my assistant give you a call as soon as we have them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness, it’s over! It wasn’t too bad, I suppose. Just a little prick, as you said. A couple of days, you say? Yes, that sounds alright. A call would be lovely. I do hope it’s nothing too alarming. Thank you, dear. You were very gentle. Now, can I go home and have a nice cup of tea? I think I deserve one!
DOCTOR: You absolutely deserve a nice cup of tea, Ms. NINI. And yes, you are free to go home now. The lab results should be back within 48 hours, and my assistant will call you as soon as they are available. If you experience any excessive bleeding or discomfort at the puncture site, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Here’s a bandage for your arm. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, I think that’s everything. A bandage is lovely, thank you. And no, I can’t think of anything else. I’m just relieved it’s over. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll be waiting for the phone call. Have a good day, dear. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. NINI. It was my pleasure. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
