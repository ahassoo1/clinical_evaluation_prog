DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. I suppose I’m hoping for a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, and I’d like to see if we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, "stuck" and not feeling yourself… that's a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain. It’s not a specific pain, or illness. More like a lack of energy, a general feeling of…blah. And I’m forgetting things more easily, little things, mostly. Not anything serious, but enough to be concerning. I used to be so sharp, and now…well. It's frustrating. I just want to feel like me again.
DOCTOR: I understand. A change in your baseline, feeling less like yourself – that's definitely worth investigating. The forgetfulness is also good to mention. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. To start, when did you first notice these feelings of low energy and this… “blah” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual thing. I'd say…maybe six months ago? It started subtly, just feeling a little more tired than usual. Then it slowly got worse. I attributed it to getting older, honestly. But it hasn’t improved, and now I’m starting to worry it’s something more. It’s been fairly consistent for the last three months, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over six months, with consistency for the last three. That helps. And aside from the fatigue and feeling “blah,” have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… my sleep hasn't been the best. I wake up feeling…unrefreshed, even if I’ve slept a reasonable amount of time. And my appetite has been a little off. Not that I’m not eating, just…less enthusiastic about it, I suppose. I used to really enjoy cooking, and now it feels like a chore. Oh, and I’ve been a bit more irritable than usual, my husband has noticed, at least. He's a very observant man.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep, decreased appetite, and increased irritability – that’s helpful information. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of the flu a few years ago, and the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so concerning. I take a daily multivitamin, and that’s about it, medication-wise. And, of course, my Medicare covers that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history, no surgeries. Just the daily multivitamin. And you mentioned Medicare, thank you for letting me know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! I've never had any trouble with any medications either, when I've needed them. It's just the multivitamin, regularly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family…are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tricky one. My mother had high blood pressure later in life, and my father…he had some heart trouble. Nothing specific, just that his heart wasn’t very strong. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from arthritis. But beyond that, not really. We weren’t a particularly medical family, if that makes sense. We just…dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live with my husband, as I mentioned. We have a quiet life, mostly. I enjoy gardening, I find it very relaxing. And I used to do a lot of pottery, shaping and molding things, but I haven’t had the energy for it lately. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a healthy diet, though my appetite has been off, as I said. We walk most days, not long distances, but enough to get some fresh air. I’d say my life is fairly…sedentary, overall, but not excessively so. It’s certainly not strenuous.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It’ll just involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs. We'll also do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I want to understand what's going on, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure it out. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just hop up on the table for me, that would be wonderful. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Coordination also appears normal. Everything seems within normal limits so far. However, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. It will help rule out some common causes of fatigue and cognitive changes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I trust your assessment. If it can help pinpoint the cause, I'm all for it. Do I need to do anything to prepare for it? And will you explain the results to me when they come back? I appreciate you taking the time to be so thorough.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare. Fasting isn't required for the tests I'm ordering. The lab technician will just need a small blood sample. I’ll order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , thyroid stimulating hormone levels, and vitamin D levels. These tests will help us evaluate your overall health, check your thyroid function, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. And yes, I will absolutely explain the results to you in detail when they come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them thoroughly. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back, so I’ll have the nurse contact you to schedule that. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very comprehensive and addressed all my concerns. Thank you for listening to me and taking me seriously. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your thoroughness and kindness. I’ll await the nurse’s call to schedule the follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Take care, and have a good day as well.
