DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, welcome! I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn't been the best lately. Been feeling a bit winded, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some shortness of breath and heart palpitations. Let’s definitely get to the bottom of that. First, let’s talk about this cough. How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe… six weeks ago? At first it was just a little tickle, but now… now it really bothers me, especially when I lie down. It keeps me up at night, poor thing. I’ve tried cough drops, but they don’t seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, okay. And is the cough productive – meaning, are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. A little bit. It’s… mostly clear, but sometimes it’s a bit… yellowish. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be worrying me. It's never bloody, thankfully. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a bad cough once… that was scary. But this isn’t like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or yellowish mucus for six weeks. Good you’ve noticed that it's not bloody - that's helpful. And you said it's worse when you lie down. Any other times it's particularly bad, or things that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it gets worse when I exert myself, of course. Just walking to the mailbox, really. And… it seems a bit worse in the mornings. Like it’s built up overnight. Cold air doesn't help either, I've noticed. Makes me cough right away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with exertion, in the mornings, and with cold air. And you mentioned your heart not feeling the best. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I get… short of breath, even just doing small things. And sometimes, my ankles swell up something awful. They look like balloons! The doctor… Doctor Ramirez, he said it was my heart, years ago. Something about it not pumping right. He gave me some pills, water pills, I think they were, and they helped for a while. But lately, it feels like it’s getting worse again. And that makes me worry about this cough too. They must be connected, don't you think?
DOCTOR: They very well could be connected, Nadene. It's good you mentioned the swelling in your ankles, and that you were previously diagnosed with a heart condition and took water pills. Do you still take those water pills?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. I take… let me see… here it is. Furosemide. Twenty milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, must be ten years now. Sometimes I forget a dose, if I’m honest. It's hard to keep track when you get to my age! But mostly, I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide 20mg daily, mostly consistently. And when was the last time you saw Doctor Ramirez, or another doctor, about your heart condition?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Doctor Ramirez… he retired, you know. That was… oh, goodness. Must be five years ago, maybe more? I started seeing Doctor Chen after that. But he just did a general check-up, nothing specific about my heart. I haven't seen anyone specifically about my heart since Doctor Ramirez left. Just been taking the pills he prescribed, you know? And hoping for the best.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about five years since you've seen a cardiologist. That gives me a good starting point. Now, let's talk about other medical conditions. Have you been diagnosed with anything else – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor Ramirez, he said I had high blood pressure, too. And… something about my cholesterol being a bit high. He put me on a pill for that, years ago, but I stopped taking it. It made my stomach upset, you know? And I figured, with the blood pressure pills, that was enough. I haven't been tested for it lately, to be honest. Just been trying to eat healthy, mostly. Though it's hard when you like to cook!
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and previously high cholesterol. And you stopped the cholesterol medication due to stomach upset. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… yes, I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. And… oh, a hysterectomy, when I was younger. That was a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. But that wasn't a surgery, just a cast. Nothing else, I don't think. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, she had heart trouble, too. She died of a heart attack when I was young. And my brother, he had diabetes. He lost his leg, poor thing. And… my aunt, on my father's side, she had cancer. Breast cancer, I think it was. It’s a scary thing, cancer. Makes you worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he tried it once, when he was young, but he didn't like it. He said it made him dizzy. I always told him, "Smoking is a terrible habit, and I won't have it in the house!"
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Not every day, mind you. Maybe two or three times a week. It helps me relax, you know? Though Doctor Ramirez always told me to be careful. He said it could interfere with my heart pills. So I don’t overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine a few times a week. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Furosemide?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a multivitamin, every day. And… a calcium supplement, for my bones. Doctor Chen recommended that. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen, for my arthritis. When my joints are acting up. That’s about it, I think. Oh! And I have some eyedrops, for my dry eyes. But that's just for my eyes, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so multivitamin, calcium supplement, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and eyedrops. That gives me a good picture of everything you're taking. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles to see if there's any swelling. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Though… it might be a little difficult, my ankles are under the table.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. Let's start with your blood pressure. Hmm, 158 over 82. A little elevated. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, I hear a slight murmur, which isn't entirely unexpected given your history. Your lungs sound a bit congested, but not significantly. Now, let's take a look at those ankles. Yes, there is some noticeable swelling, particularly on both sides, and some mild pitting edema when I press. Okay, and finally, I'm just going to quickly check your oxygen saturation with this pulse oximeter. 92%. That's a little on the lower side of normal.
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… serious, Doctor. What does all that mean? My blood pressure is high? And what’s a murmur? And edema? I don't understand. And ninety-two… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break it down. Your blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like to see, which can put extra strain on your heart. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes, and like I said, it's not uncommon with a history of heart problems – it doesn't necessarily mean anything is acutely wrong, but it's something we need to investigate further. Edema is just a fancy word for swelling, and it's often caused by fluid building up in your body, which can happen when your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently. And 92% oxygen saturation is a little lower than ideal; we like to see it above 95%. All of this together – the high blood pressure, the murmur, the edema, and the slightly low oxygen – points towards your heart potentially having some difficulty keeping up, and the fluid buildup could be contributing to your shortness of breath and cough. Now, I want to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… frightening, Doctor. But yes, please. Anything you think will help. Blood tests and an X-ray… I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better. And maybe get rid of this awful cough. It’s keeping me up at night. Where will I go for those tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you trust me. We’ll send you down to the lab just across the hall for the blood tests. They’ll check things like your kidney function, electrolytes, and a marker called BNP, which helps us assess your heart. And then the X-ray technician will take a picture of your chest, which will help us see if there's any fluid in your lungs. Typically, the results come back within 24-48 hours. My nurse, Sarah, will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a diuretic – a stronger water pill than what you're currently taking – to help get rid of some of that fluid buildup. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A stronger pill to help with the fluid. That’s good. And Sarah will call me with the results… thank you. Is there anything I should be doing right now? Should I be resting more? Or eating something special? And… will this new pill interact with my other medications? I always worry about that.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and it's smart to be thinking about potential interactions. The new diuretic, Furosemide 40mg once daily, can interact with some medications, so we’ve already checked against your list and it should be safe. However, it’s important to monitor your potassium levels, as diuretics can sometimes lower them. Sarah will let you know if you need to adjust any of your other medications. For now, I recommend resting more and avoiding strenuous activity. Keep your legs elevated whenever possible to help reduce the swelling. Also, limit your salt intake, as salt can cause your body to retain fluid. And drink plenty of water to help flush out the excess fluid. As for eating, just focus on a healthy, balanced diet. No need for anything special. And most importantly, if you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Rest, elevate my legs, limit salt, drink water, and be careful. And watch for shortness of breath or dizziness. And I’ll get those tests done right away. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind a little more at ease, even though it's still worrying. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. I’m glad I could help, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get those tests done and figure out what’s going on. You take care now, and I’ll talk to you soon.
