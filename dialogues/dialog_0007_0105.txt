DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I'm Valerie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Valerie. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? It’s kinda hard to explain… I think my wife set this up. She said something about an evaluation? I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to have your spouse involved in setting things up, and details can be fuzzy. So, you're interested in exploring weight loss surgery as an option?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. I mean, I think so. I’ve been… bigger for a while now, and it's getting harder to do things. I get tired easily, and my knees… they bother me. My wife says surgery could help, and I trust her. But honestly, I don’t know much about it. What does an evaluation even do?
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable. It's good you're here to learn more. An evaluation is really just a thorough check-up to see if surgery is a safe and appropriate option for you. We'll go over your medical history, do a physical exam, and likely some blood work. It helps us understand your overall health and any potential risks. First, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high last time I went for a check-up, a few years ago maybe? But I don’t remember if he gave me anything for it. And… I don’t think so on the diabetes or heart stuff. I haven’t been to the doctor much lately, to be honest. It's kinda embarrassing, I know.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Bradlee. It happens. We're just trying to get a complete picture here. Okay, high blood pressure a few years ago, without medication, noted. And what about any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, so I had surgery for that. That was a long time ago, obviously. And… I think I had my tonsils out, too. But that was when I was little, like really little. I don’t really remember it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, those both count. Broken arm and tonsillectomy, good to know. Okay, moving on, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh, my mom and dad are both… okay, I guess. They live back home, in Iraq. My wife’s family is here, they’re good people. But… about health problems… I don’t really know much about what they have, to be honest. We don’t talk about that stuff much. I know my dad has always been… bigger, like me. But I don’t know if that’s a medical thing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Family medical history can be tricky to gather. Okay, so your father has a history of being larger, noted. That can sometimes be relevant. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, never have. My wife doesn't either. She wouldn’t let me! And… uh, I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every night.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. Let's move onto medications - are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medicines, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I took some pain relievers for my knee a while back, but that was just for a few days. And… sometimes I take a multivitamin, but that’s about it. Nothing regular, nothing the doctor prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional pain relievers and a multivitamin. Noted. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. My wife always checks when we try new food, just in case, but… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, could you tell me a bit more about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Uh, sure. Well, I work at the retail store, you know? Mostly just helping customers, stocking shelves… It’s not very active, mostly standing. I get home, eat dinner with my wife… we watch TV sometimes. I get tired pretty easily, so I don’t do much after that. Weekends are kinda the same, just… slower. I try to walk sometimes, but it’s hard. My knees bother me, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mostly sedentary job, some evening relaxation, and difficulty with walking due to knee pain. Thank you for sharing that. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I guess… I worry about it a lot. About the surgery, you know? It sounds scary, and I don't want anything to go wrong. My wife says it’ll be okay, but… I'm still nervous. And… I feel bad about my weight, sometimes. Like I’m letting my wife down.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel nervous and have those concerns, Bradlee. It's a big decision, and it's good that you're acknowledging those feelings. We'll talk through all the risks and benefits, and make sure you feel comfortable with every step. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Your heart and lungs sound good, but I did notice some fullness in your abdomen. I'm going to listen to your knees. Your knees have some crepitus, which is a grinding sound, and some tenderness when I touch them. That likely contributes to your pain. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Do you have any questions before I order those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. No, I don't think so. What will it tell you, exactly? What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Good question. The blood work will give us a lot of information. The complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or anemia. The metabolic panel will check your kidney and liver function, as well as your blood sugar levels. The lipid panel will check your cholesterol levels. Essentially, we're looking to make sure you're healthy enough to undergo surgery safely, and to identify any potential risks or complications. It'll also help us understand if there are any underlying conditions that need to be addressed before we move forward. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes a little more sense. So you're just… checking everything, making sure I’m not… broken inside? How long does the blood work take? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Not "broken inside," Bradlee! Just making sure everything is functioning as it should be. And no, the blood work won't hurt. A phlebotomist will just take a small sample of blood from your arm. It's a quick pinch, and it's usually over very quickly. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and go over your options in more detail. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. 24-48 hours… okay. My wife will probably want to know right away. So… I guess I just wait for the results? And then we talk more?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You just wait for the results, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss everything in detail. I'll have the phlebotomist come in and draw the blood now. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m okay. Just… getting this done is good. Thank you, Valerie. You explained everything really well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bradlee. I'm glad I could help. Let me call the phlebotomist, and they’ll be right in. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I will.
