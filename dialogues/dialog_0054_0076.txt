DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? They’re red and kinda sore. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them. And how long have they been bothering you, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and I didn't think much of it. Thought I just bumped 'em on somethin'. But then more kept showin’ up, and they started gettin’ more painful. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… achy, you know? Especially when I’m walkin’ a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, starting small and gradually getting more numerous and achy, especially with walking. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes them better – like resting, or any specific creams or lotions you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Well, restin’ does help a little. When I sit down and put my feet up, it doesn’t hurt as much. My wife, she rubbed some Vicks Vaporub on 'em once, said it might help with the inflammation. Didn't really do much, though. I haven't tried anythin' else, really. I usually just ignore things, hoping they’ll go away on their own.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes things do resolve on their own. Vicks Vaporub isn’t typically what we’d recommend for this, but thank you for letting me know. Now, aside from the aching and redness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. No fever, no chills. They don’t itch, and they aren’t… ooze or anything like that. Just red and sore. I feel okay otherwise, I guess. Normal old man stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: “Normal old man stuff” is perfectly alright! Let's try to get a little more detailed. Have you noticed any changes in your skin anywhere else – any rashes, dryness, or new moles, for example?
PATIENT: No, nothing else on my skin. Just these bumps. My skin’s always been pretty… normal. Gets a little dry in the winter, that’s all. I live in the Philippines most of my life, so used to the heat. Been here in the states for a few years now, and the weather’s different. But no, no rashes or moles or anything like that. Just these pesky bumps on my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so I must have somethin’ wrong with me, right? Just kiddin’. Seriously though, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take pills for it, every morning. And my knees… they bother me sometimes, old age again. But other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain. That's helpful. And do you recall what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… my wife handles most of that stuff. I think it's… Lisinopril? Yeah, that sounds right. Lisinopril. Small white pill, I take one every mornin’ with breakfast. She fills the prescription every month at the pharmacy down the street.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, back in the Philippines. That was a long time ago, though. And… I was in the hospital for a few days once when I broke my arm fallin’ off a mango tree. That was also a long time ago. Other than that, nothin’ much. Just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken arm, both a long time ago. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she had… diabetes, I think. And my father, he had problems with his heart, towards the end. He had to be careful what he ate. My wife’s side of the family… they’re pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nobody with anything serious, not that I remember. It’s hard to keep track, you know? Lots of relatives back home.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Okay, diabetes and heart problems on your mother and father's side. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always asks me that before she gives me anything new, and I always tell her no. Never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, which is a blessing, I tell you. Especially mangoes!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, Mr. Aluia, thank you for all of that information. That gives me a good overview. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a look at those bumps on your legs. Could you please sit up a little higher on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to move 'em around or anything. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to take a closer look. These are indeed raised bumps, reddish in color. They feel warm to the touch and are somewhat tender when I press on them. They appear to be clustered together. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s a little sore. Not awful, but I can definitely feel it. Like a dull ache, kinda. It’s more painful on this leg, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see they are a bit more numerous and tender on your right leg. There’s no evidence of any open sores or drainage, which is good. I don't see any significant swelling in your ankles or feet. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing these bumps without further investigation, but they could be a few things. One possibility is stasis dermatitis, which can happen with some circulation issues, especially if you’ve had high blood pressure for a while. Another could be a form of eczema, or even a localized skin infection. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a couple of tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? Okay… What kind of tests? I don’t mind a little blood work, I guess. As long as it’s not too much. I don’t like needles, you know. What are we lookin’ for exactly? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Aluia. It's completely normal to be anxious about needles. We'll only take a small sample of blood, and it shouldn’t be too painful. We're primarily looking to check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, and also some markers of inflammation to see if there's an underlying infection or skin condition. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel just to get a good overview of your kidney and liver function. It's a pretty standard set of tests. It's unlikely to be something serious, but it’s always best to rule things out and get a clear diagnosis so we can get you feeling better. Would you like me to explain any of those terms in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. Blood sugar, inflammation… yeah, that makes sense. I guess I should get my blood checked, then. It’s probably a good idea. My wife always tells me I need to be more careful with my health. She’ll be happy to hear I’m gettin’ tests. What do I have to do? Do I have to fast before the blood work? And where do I go to get it done?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for 8 to 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. We'll schedule you for a blood draw at the lab right across the street, here at the Clarke Medical Center. They're open until 5 PM today, so you could go whenever it’s convenient for you. I’ll write down the address and phone number on this form, along with instructions on how to prepare. Once the results are back, which usually takes a couple of days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, you can continue to elevate your legs whenever possible, and avoid scratching them. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, 8 to 12 hours, no food, water is okay. Lab across the street. Elevate my legs… yeah, I can do that. That's not too bad. No, I think that’s everything. You explained it pretty well, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look at these bumps and figure out what’s goin’ on. I'll go get the blood work done tomorrow morning, first thing.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, increased pain, redness, or swelling – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. And I will let you know if anything changes. Bye now. .
