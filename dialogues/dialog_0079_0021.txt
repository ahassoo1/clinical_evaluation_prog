DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 60 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, sixty years old, give or take a few days. It's my foot, see? It's been swelling up. Mostly just one of 'em, the left one. It's been botherin' me for... oh, I dunno, maybe a week now? Not sure exactly, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And just the left foot, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just the left one. The right one's fine. It's not painful painful, more like... heavy, ya know? And kinda warm. Feels a bit tight in my shoe, even when I loosen the laces. It's mostly just annoying, but it's gettin' worse each day, I think.
DOCTOR: “Warm”, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, warmer than the other foot. Not fever warm, like when you're sick, but if I touch it, it's definitely warmer. And it's kinda… red, I guess. Not bright red, but a bit pinkish compared to my other foot. I noticed it when I was putting on my sandals the other day. I usually don't pay too much attention to my feet, if I'm bein' honest.
DOCTOR: Pinkish and warm… Alright. And has anything caused this, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I haven't bumped it or anything. I've been doin' my usual, ya know? Walkin' to the store, a bit of gardenin', nothin' too strenuous. I did wear new shoes a couple of times last week, but they didn't feel tight. Maybe that? I dunno, doc. I really haven't done anything different. It just started swellin’ up.
DOCTOR: New shoes... possibly. We'll need to examine it. If you'll allow me, I’d like to take a look. Please have a seat on the examination table and remove your shoe and sock from your left foot.
PATIENT: Sure, doc, no problem. It’s a bit uncomfortable even just gettin' 'em off now. Here we go... Be careful, it might be tender.
DOCTOR: Alright… Yes, I do see some swelling around the dorsum and medial malleolus. Skin is warm to the touch, as you mentioned, and there is some erythema. No obvious signs of trauma. Any pain with range of motion?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit of a pinch when you move it like that. Not sharp pain, more like a dull ache, right around the ankle bone. Feels a bit stiff too, like it hasn't been used properly. And... yeah, I can feel it now, a little bit of tenderness if I press right here.
DOCTOR: Tenderness present on the posterior tibial tendon… Hmm. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, not really. Feels normal, you know? I can wiggle my toes alright, and it doesn't feel like pins and needles or nothin'. Just a bit…heavy, like I said before. And maybe a little bit achy. Is this somethin' serious, doc? I gotta get to work tomorrow...
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Based on what you’ve described, and my brief examination, it could be a sprain, tendonitis, or even the beginnings of something more…involved. Given your description of warmth and erythema, we need to rule out infection as a possibility. I’d like to order some bloodwork to check for inflammation. And, to get a better look at the structures in your foot, I recommend an X-ray.
PATIENT: Bloodwork and an X-ray, huh? Okay, doc, whatever you think is best. I just wanna get this sorted out. I haven't got time to be limpin' around. Where do I go for those? And... how much is all this gonna cost? I don't have insurance, so I'm a bit worried about the bill.
DOCTOR: Right. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is in the imaging center across the parking lot. I’ll write you the requisitions now. As for the cost… unfortunately, without insurance, it can be quite significant. The bloodwork will likely be around \$150-\$200, and the X-ray, depending on the views needed, could be another \$200-\$300. I understand this is a financial burden, and I can provide you with a list of local resources that may offer financial assistance for medical bills. Here are the forms. Once you have the results, you can bring them back here, and we’ll discuss the next steps. I also recommend limiting your activity on that foot until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: \$350-\$500... that's... a lot. Okay, I'll get those done. And I'll ask about the financial help. Thank you, Doc. Limitin' my activity... that's gonna be tough, but I guess I gotta. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, ice it or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can certainly try icing it. Apply ice for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Elevate your foot whenever possible, and try to avoid putting any weight on it if it's causing pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may also help to manage the discomfort. However, if the pain worsens, or you develop a fever, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yeah, doc, I got it. Ice, elevation, and those pain pills. No fever and don't push it. I’ll try to take it easy. Thank you for explainin' everything, and for the list of places to get help with the money. I appreciate it. I guess I'll go get these tests done now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Parascondola. Please let the front desk know when you've scheduled your tests. And do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a… tolerable day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. .
