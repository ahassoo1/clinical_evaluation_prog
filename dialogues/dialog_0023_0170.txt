DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? A medical exam for the insurance company. I’d like to get it over with if we could, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: A life insurance exam. Right. Well, we'll certainly do our best to be efficient. Still, it's important to be thorough. Now, to start, are you currently experiencing any health problems at all?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? Old age, I guess. Nothing major, though. No big aches or pains or anything like that.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. You’re 49, Mr. Putney, which isn't exactly ancient. Let's be a little more specific. When you say “tired,” can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s just… like, at the end of the day, I’m just spent. Like I’ve been working hard all day, even if I haven’t been doing much physically. It’s hard to explain. Not like sick tired, just… worn out. And sometimes I wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep enough, even if I had a full eight hours. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, even after adequate sleep. And this has been going on for…?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… I don’t know exactly. Maybe six months? A little over? It’s come and gone, you know? Some weeks are better than others. Honestly, I haven’t really kept track. I just figured it was stress from work, mostly. Running the lodging place is a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of intermittent fatigue. Work-related stress is a common culprit, certainly. Now, besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little… thirstier than usual, maybe? I drink a lot of water anyway, living in this heat, but I feel like I’m constantly reaching for a glass. And I think I’ve had to use the bathroom more often, too. But honestly, that could just be the water, right?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and urination… Could be a number of things, of course. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat about the same as always. I like my food, so I haven’t been skipping meals or anything. Maybe a little less hungry sometimes, but nothing I’d really notice unless you asked. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had anything like that. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, but that’s about it, as far as family goes. I just want to get this insurance thing done. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Putney. It's important to be complete. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nope. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That's it. Nothing else. Look, I understand you need to ask these questions, but… is there anything you think we should focus on? Based on what I’ve already told you? Because this fatigue and thirst are the only things I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: Very well. Considering your reported fatigue, increased thirst, and normal appetite, we should perhaps investigate your blood sugar levels. It’s prudent to rule out any metabolic issues. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. No pills, no vitamins, nothing. I try to stay natural, if you know what I mean. Are we getting close to the actual exam part yet? I’d rather not spend the whole day here.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re getting to the physical exam. However, a few more questions are necessary for a comprehensive assessment. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. Food, drugs, insects… nothing. I'm pretty lucky that way too, I guess. Okay, let’s just get this done, alright? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Let's proceed with the physical examination. We'll start with your vital signs. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Just… hurry, please. I really don’t like being in doctors’ offices.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 88 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to order some blood work. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. This will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Fasting blood glucose? That sounds like the sugar thing. Do you think something's wrong? I thought you said it was just routine. I don't want to get worried about nothing. Can we just skip the blood work? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your apprehension. However, skipping the blood work is not advisable. Based on your reported symptoms – the fatigue, increased thirst, and normal appetite – it is prudent to investigate the possibility of diabetes or pre-diabetes. It does not necessarily mean you have anything seriously wrong, but we need to gather more information to make an accurate assessment. A fasting blood glucose test simply requires you to abstain from eating for eight hours before the blood draw. It’s a relatively simple procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. The lab technician is skilled and efficient. Ignoring these symptoms could have long-term consequences. We are simply being thorough, as we should. Will you consent to the blood work?
PATIENT: … Fine. Okay, fine. Do the blood work. But… can you tell me what exactly it means if it is something? Just… be straight with me. No fancy doctor talk, alright? I need to know. I hate this. I really, really hate this.
DOCTOR: Very well. If the blood work reveals elevated glucose levels, it could indicate diabetes, a condition where your body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose from the food you eat enter your cells to be used for energy. If diagnosed with diabetes, it's manageable with lifestyle changes - diet, exercise – and, potentially, medication. The goal is to keep your blood sugar levels under control to prevent complications. However, let's not jump to conclusions. We will review the results when they come back and discuss the appropriate course of action. For now, I'll have the lab technician draw your blood. They'll call you when the results are available, which typically takes a few days. Do you have any questions before I call them in?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s it. Just… get it over with. I just want to go home. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Putney. I'll inform the lab technician. Please try to relax. We will discuss the results as soon as they are available. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood from Mr. Putney?
