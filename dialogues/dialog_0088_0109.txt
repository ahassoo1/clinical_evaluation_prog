DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now, I think. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. It’s a dull ache, not a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels… like pressure, maybe? Like someone is squeezing the back of my skull. It's worse when I stand for a long time. I used to work on the trains, you see. Lots of standing. And walking. Not so much now, though. I’m… old.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure at the back of your skull, worse with standing. And you used to work on the trains, lots of standing and walking. Do you notice anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well… resting helps. If I sit down, it gets better. And… sometimes when I eat something sweet, it feels… a little bit worse for a few minutes. Not always, though. And… I don't know if this matters… but the weather has been very hot. Very, very hot. Makes my head feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting helps, sweet foods sometimes make it worse briefly, and you've noticed it's affected by the heat. That's good information. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. No dizziness. I haven’t thrown up. My vision… it's okay. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I’m old! I need new glasses, probably. I forget things, too, but that’s just… me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No fever, no dizziness, no vomiting, vision is a little blurry but you think that’s just needing new glasses, and some forgetfulness. Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no weakness. No numbness. I can move everything okay. I walk a little slow, but that’s… you know. Old age! My hands get a little shaky sometimes, but that's been happening for a long time. Not new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new weakness, numbness, or shaking. And the hand shaking is something you've had for a while. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my blood pressure… the doctor told me it was a little high a few years ago. He gave me a pill, but… I stopped taking it. It made me feel tired. And my knees… they bother me sometimes. Very sore when it rains. And… I don’t know, I guess that’s it. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. I don’t have much money for those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, you stopped taking medication for it because of tiredness, and sore knees. I see. And you mentioned not having insurance, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No insurance. Never had it. Too expensive. My wife… she had insurance when she worked, but she… she passed away five years ago. It's just me now. It’s okay, though. I manage.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. That must be very difficult. Okay, so no current medications, past history of high blood pressure, and no insurance. Let's do a quick exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look at your eyes and ears, and finally I'll do a brief neurological exam – just check your reflexes and strength. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sounds… fine. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I get a little nervous when doctors poke and prod, but I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax your arm for me, please. 150/90. A little elevated, as you mentioned you were told previously. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal, a slight murmur, but that's common at your age. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I try to remember to blink, but sometimes I forget… My wife used to remind me. She was very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Some mild cataracts, which is also common with age. Now I'm going to check your ears… A little wax buildup, but nothing concerning. Now, let's do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think so. It’s a little hard to see sometimes, but I’m trying. Is that fast enough? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly fine. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age. Strength is 5 out of 5 in all extremities. Now, can you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It takes a little effort, but I can do it. My knees… they complain a little. There. I'm sitting now. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, you're doing great, Mr. Brum. Alright, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by the weather and your past blood pressure issues. The wax buildup in your ears could also be contributing slightly. The diminished reflexes and mild cataracts are typical for your age. However, given your age and history of high blood pressure, I want to be cautious. I'm going to recommend a CT scan of your head just to rule out any other possibilities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A… a scan? What kind of scan? Does it hurt? And… how much will it cost? I don't have much money, Doctor. I just want my headache to go away. Is there something else I can take? Maybe a pill?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Brum. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn't usually hurt – you'll just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. As for the cost, that's a concern, and I understand. Given your lack of insurance, it could be expensive. Let me see if the hospital has any financial assistance programs available. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage your headache in the meantime. However, to rule out anything serious, the scan is the best course of action. If you're hesitant, we can also consider referring you to a neurologist for a second opinion. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A neurologist? That sounds… expensive too. Maybe the scan… if you think it's important. But what if I can't afford it? I don't want to be a burden. And what if… what if it finds something bad? I'm an old man, Doctor. I've lived a long life. Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Mr. Brum. It's important to weigh the risks and benefits. It is possible the scan will find something, but it's also possible it will be perfectly normal, and that would give us peace of mind. Given your age and history, I do think it's worth considering, but I completely understand your financial concerns. Let me talk to the hospital’s financial department and see what options are available. Perhaps they can offer a reduced rate or a payment plan. In the meantime, we can try managing your headache with over-the-counter pain relievers and focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough rest. We can also re-evaluate if the pain gets worse or you develop any new symptoms, like fever, weakness, or vision changes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds better, Doctor. If you can talk to the hospital, that would be good. And the pills… yes, I can try the pills. I just want to feel better. And thank you. For listening. For not… rushing me. It’s nice to have someone who understands.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's my job to listen and help in any way I can. Let me get a prescription for ibuprofen 200mg, take two tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for the headache, but don’t exceed 6 tablets in 24 hours. I'll also have my assistant call the hospital’s financial department and see what options are available for the CT scan. In the meantime, if your headache gets worse, or if you develop any fever, weakness, numbness, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I’ll take the pills, and I’ll wait to hear about the scan. Have a good day, Doctor Piet.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. You take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. My assistant will be in touch shortly. Have a good day as well. .
