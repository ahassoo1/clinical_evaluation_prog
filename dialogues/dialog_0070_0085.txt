DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…fine to meet you, I suppose. Well, it’s this discoloration, really. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, it’s not a good look. It started a few weeks ago, and it's just…spreading. I noticed it first on my hands, but now it’s…well, you’ll see. I’m very particular about my appearance, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Appearance is important. So, this discoloration… you said it started a few weeks ago on your hands and is now spreading. Could you describe the discoloration for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not…easy to describe. It's not a rash, certainly. More like…patches. Uneven patches of a sort of…dull color. Not bright, thankfully. It’s not red, you see. Red would be dreadful. It's…a brownish-gray, I suppose? And it’s not raised or itchy or anything. Just…there. It’s really most noticeable in daylight, which is, naturally, a problem.
DOCTOR: Brownish-gray patches, not raised or itchy, and more noticeable in daylight. Alright. And where else have you noticed these patches besides your hands?
PATIENT: Well, it's on my forearms now, definitely. And……I think it’s starting on my neck. Just a little, you understand, but I notice these things. It's quite subtle, but if I’m being honest, it's there. It’s creeping up, really. It’s just…distressing. You wouldn't happen to have seen anything like it before, would you? I've been very careful with the sun, you know.
DOCTOR: We see a variety of skin conditions here, Ms. Bartock. It’s good you’re being so observant and bringing this to my attention. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if anything seems to trigger the discoloration?
PATIENT: Trigger? Well, I haven’t been doing anything different. I haven’t changed my soap, or my lotion, or anything like that. I eat a perfectly balanced diet, mostly. Perhaps a bit too much chocolate, but I doubt that’s it. It just…appeared. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s stress. My husband’s sister is getting married, and it’s been…a production. A complete production. And my mother is involved, naturally. It's exhausting. Do you think it could be stress? It seems the most logical explanation.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly manifest in various ways, Ms. Bartock. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. Well, I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. And I had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis when I was in university. But nothing…serious. My blood pressure is always perfectly normal, I check it regularly. And I’ve never had any allergies, thank goodness. Oh! And I had a mole removed from my back about ten years ago. Perfectly benign, the doctor assured me. Everything else…I really can’t think of anything. I’m generally quite healthy, you know. I take very good care of myself. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. Knowing you've been generally healthy and that the mole removal was benign is good information. And no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you understand. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side. And I drink a lot of herbal tea, chamomile mostly. But that’s it. No prescriptions, no painkillers, nothing like that. I find fresh air and a good book are far more effective. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s a vitamin deficiency. Or perhaps a slight imbalance. You wouldn’t happen to have a test for that, would you?
DOCTOR: We can certainly look into vitamin levels, Ms. Bartock. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just take a look at the affected areas and a few other things. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I suppose that’s necessary. Though I must warn you, I’m rather sensitive. Please be gentle. And try not to use cold instruments, if possible. I really dislike the feeling of cold on my skin. I don’t want to startle myself. Is there anything I should do? Should I lie down?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. We'll be as gentle as possible. No cold instruments, I assure you. You can remain seated; there's no need to lie down. I'll just examine your hands, forearms, and neck. Alright. I’m noting some uneven patches of brownish-gray discoloration on your hands, forearms, and a mild presentation on your neck, as you described. The patches aren’t raised, and your skin feels smooth to the touch. There is no tenderness or warmth. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged. Based on this initial examination, it doesn’t appear to be an acute inflammatory condition. However, to get a definitive diagnosis, I would like to order a few blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and some autoimmune markers. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…thorough. Autoimmune markers? That sounds rather serious. Is that common? I haven’t been feeling unwell, you understand. Just…this discoloration. Well, if you think it’s necessary, I suppose so. Blood tests are a nuisance, of course. I always bruise so easily. But if it will rule things out, then…yes, go ahead. Please make sure they use a small needle. And a gentle nurse. I really dislike needles. Do you think it could be…something I’m eating? Perhaps I’m sensitive to something without realizing it? I do enjoy a good pastry…
DOCTOR: It’s good to be thorough, Ms. Bartock. Autoimmune markers are just part of a routine workup to rule out potential causes. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. And we'll certainly use a small needle and I'll make a note to request a gentle nurse for you. It’s possible it could be related to something you're eating, though it's less common. We’ll get the blood tests done first and then discuss the results. I’m also going to order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. I'm writing the orders now. The lab technician will draw blood from your arm. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, fifteen to twenty minutes. That’s…acceptable, I suppose. Will they need a large sample? I always feel so faint afterwards. And will I need to fast beforehand? I had a rather late breakfast. I do enjoy a cup of coffee with my pastry… Perhaps I should avoid coffee tomorrow, just in case. Is there anything I should bring with me to the follow-up appointment? Will I need to bring a list of my…herbal teas? I do have quite a collection. This is all rather…inconvenient, you know. I had planned a rather lovely afternoon. Perhaps I should cancel my plans. Do you think I should cancel my plans?
DOCTOR: They won’t need a large sample, Ms. Bartock, and you don’t need to fast beforehand. You can have your coffee and pastry as usual. As for the follow-up, bringing a list of your herbal teas would be helpful, yes. It’s always good to have a complete picture. Cancelling your plans is entirely up to you. If you’re feeling anxious about it, it might be best to reschedule. However, the tests themselves are quick and relatively painless. I understand this is inconvenient, and I apologize for that. We’re just trying to rule out any potential causes for the discoloration and get to the bottom of this. Here's the requisition form for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will guide you through the process. Once you've had the tests done, please call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Down the hall, you say? Is it…air-conditioned? I do get rather warm easily. And is it…busy? I dislike crowds. Well, I suppose there’s nothing else for it. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m not particularly reassured. This discoloration is quite distressing, you know. I do hope it’s nothing serious. Perhaps it is just stress. Yes, that must be it. My husband’s sister's wedding…a complete production. Very well. I’ll go and have the tests done. And I'll bring a list of my teas. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you…again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a good afternoon.
