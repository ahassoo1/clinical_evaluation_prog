DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It is nice to meet you too. Dr. Morenomartinez, you said? Honestly, I can't really say there’s a reason, exactly. My daughter thought I should… get checked out. She worries too much. Just thought I'd see what all the fuss is about, I suppose. It's not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilly. It’s always good to be proactive, and daughters often have good instincts. So, even though you’re not feeling sick, let’s just do a little check-up to make sure everything is as it should be. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what your normal day-to-day is like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My day? Well, I mostly stay home. Used to be a surgical tech, you know, for… a long time. But that was… ages ago. Now I just watch TV, do a little gardening when the weather's nice. Not much else, really. My husband… he did most of the things around the house. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Lilly. That must be difficult. Let’s focus on you for now. When you say “gardening,” how strenuous would you describe that activity?
PATIENT: Oh, it's alright dear, been a while now. It was difficult, but you get used to things, I suppose. As for the gardening... not very strenuous at all. Just a little weeding, mostly. And some light watering. I don’t do any heavy lifting, not anymore. My back isn’t what it used to be. Mostly just puttering around.
DOCTOR: Okay, "light activity." And how about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Oh, you mean what do I eat? Well, I try to eat… reasonably. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, I confess. My daughter brings me groceries, mostly healthy things. I sneak a cookie or two when she's not looking. And soup. I like soup.
DOCTOR: A little bit of what you enjoy is perfectly fine! And soup is excellent. Now, have you noticed any changes recently – in your energy levels, your sleep, your appetite, or your weight?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. Honestly, everything feels… the same. Maybe I’m a bit more tired than I used to be, but then again, I'm sixty-four! It's hard to say. My daughter keeps saying I've lost weight, but I haven't been keeping track. I just wear what fits, you know?
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Okay. And how about any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. My joints ache a bit sometimes, especially when it’s cold. But that's just… old age, I think. I take a little something for it now and then. Nothing serious. Mostly just a little stiffness in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me see. There’s… that pill for my joints, like I said. It's… a little white one. And I take something for my blood pressure, I think. My daughter handles all that, mostly. I just take what she gives me. Honestly, I don’t even know what half of them are for.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll definitely get a complete list of your medications sorted out today, Lilly. It's important to know exactly what you’re taking. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don’t think so. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes when the pollen is bad, but that’s just seasonal, I suppose. Nothing serious enough to worry about. I don’t really have much in the way of… sensitivities, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. As long as it’s not too… invasive. I’m not a big fan of doctors poking and prodding, if you know what I mean. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. Just be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate, then listen to your lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… like a lot. But alright, I suppose. As long as you tell me what you're doing before you do it. I don’t like surprises. And please, don’t use a cold stethoscope. Those always give me the shivers.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilly. No cold stoscopes, I promise. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. There’s a slight murmur, which is not uncommon at your age. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Murmurs and clear lungs… sounds rather complicated. Is that bad? My daughter will want to know all of this, you know. She’s very particular about my health.
DOCTOR: It sounds complicated, but it’s not necessarily bad, Lilly. Many people have murmurs, especially as they get older, and they don’t cause any problems at all. The clear lungs are good news! Now, I'm just going to check your ears, eyes, and throat. Everything looks good there, just a little dryness in your throat. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax and take deep breaths. Abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Normal and normal… sounds much better. Dry throat, though. I have been feeling a bit thirsty lately. Maybe I should drink more water. My daughter always tells me I don’t drink enough water.
DOCTOR: That's a very good idea, Lilly. Staying hydrated is important. Now, based on what we’ve talked about and the exam, everything seems relatively stable, but I do want to order a few basic blood tests to get a better picture of your overall health. These will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. It'll also include a complete blood count to rule out any anemia or infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear, more tests? Seems like a lot of fuss over nothing. But alright, if you think it's necessary. My daughter will be pleased, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long, and I don't have to fast or anything like that. I hate fasting.
DOCTOR: You’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, I’m afraid. But it's a relatively short process, and it gives us a lot of important information. We’ll schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning, so you won’t have to fast for too long. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes. Do you have any questions about the tests or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: Oh, twelve hours? That's… a long time. I usually have a little something before bed, you know. And first thing in the morning? I’m not a morning person. But alright, I suppose. As long as they're gentle with the needle. I hate needles. And can I have a cup of tea with breakfast after?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you can have a cup of tea with breakfast after. And don’t worry, the lab technicians are very gentle. I'll make a note on the requisition form about your aversion to needles. Now, while we're waiting for the test results, I recommend increasing your water intake and continuing to eat a healthy diet. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and make any necessary recommendations. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. More tea sounds good. And yes, next week is fine. As long as it's not too early. Honestly, I don’t really expect much to be wrong. But my daughter will be glad we’re being thorough, I suppose. She always worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to have someone who cares, even if they worry a bit too much! I’ll go ahead and schedule your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. And I'll send the lab requisition form to the front desk, and they’ll give you instructions on how to schedule your blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, Tuesday at two... alright. That sounds… manageable. No, I don't think so, dear. You've explained everything very clearly, and you’ve been very patient with an old woman like me. I appreciate that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go have a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Lilly. And remember, plenty of water and a nice cup of tea! Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Oh, you too, dear. Thank you again.
