DOCTOR: Hi Derick, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Georgiou, was it? It’s…it’s my face and legs, see? They’re just… puffy. Been that way a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why though, honestly. It just…happened.
DOCTOR: Yes, Georgiou is right. And puffy…okay. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More? What do you want to know? It's just… swollen. Like a balloon, almost. Mostly my face, and then… down here. I don’t go out much anymore, so I didn't really notice right away, if you catch my drift. It’s not like I’m looking in the mirror all day, you know? My wife… well, she would have said something. But she’s… gone now. So.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal not to notice changes when things are… different. And it's okay that you didn't realize it right away. So, the puffiness... when did you first start to notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me dates… I’m terrible with dates. Let me think… sometime after… well, after the funeral, I suppose. A few months maybe? It wasn't sudden, like. It just… crept up on me. Honestly, Doctor, I just figured it was age. Things start to droop when you get old, don’t they?
DOCTOR: That's fair, things can change as we get older. But it's good you came in to get it checked out, just to be sure. So, a few months now. Has the puffiness been getting worse gradually, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm. Worse, I think. Yes, definitely worse. It’s not like it doubled overnight, but… if I had to guess? It’s a bit more noticeable each week, maybe. Makes me look… well, not myself, you know? And my shoes feel a little tighter. Not much, but enough to bother me. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And it's good you've noticed your shoes feeling tighter – that suggests swelling in your legs and feet, which can be connected to the puffiness in your face. Do you notice any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. It’s not painful, exactly. It’s more… heavy. Like wearing weights. And a little itchy sometimes, around my ankles. But no, no real pain. I've had plenty of pain in my life, from the welding, you understand. This ain’t like that. This is… just annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and itchy, not painful. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, have you noticed any changes in how much you're urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? Goodness. Now you’re asking about… well. I go to the bathroom, yes. Same as always, I suppose. Maybe… maybe a little less? Now that you mention it. But I don't keep track of such things! I just… go when I need to go. It’s not like I'm running to the toilet all day, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so maybe slightly less urination than usual. Have you had any changes in your appetite, or have you gained or lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Appetite? I eat when I'm hungry, Doctor. Mostly simple things. Soup, sandwiches… I’m not a fussy eater. And I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a long time. Probably lost a little, to be honest. Not eating as much since… well, since Martha passed. It just doesn't taste the same without her. It’s hard to explain. Food just… doesn’t appeal like it used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Derick. It's completely natural for your appetite to change during times of grief. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Okay, so no significant weight changes, a slightly decreased appetite, and maybe a bit less urine than usual. One more question for now – have you noticed any shortness of breath, or do you find yourself getting tired more easily than usual?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Now you’re asking me things. Well, I do get a little winded climbing the stairs, but I always have. Old age, you know. And tired? Of course I’m tired. I'm an old man! I nap a lot. But it's not like I'm collapsing or anything. Just… regular old man tiredness. I used to be able to work all day, welding, but that was… a long time ago. Everything’s harder now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Derick, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and face. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you must. But don't poke around too much, eh? I’m not as young as I used to be. And be gentle with the legs, if you wouldn’t mind. They’re a bit tender, even if I don’t complain much. Get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, in and out… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a little bit of congestion in your lungs. Nothing terribly concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's check your blood pressure… Blood pressure is a little elevated, but again, not immediately alarming. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Hmm… yes, I can definitely see some swelling in your ankles and lower legs. It’s soft to the touch, but it's noticeable. And your skin is a little shiny. Your face is definitely puffy, as you described. Now, last thing, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender. Everything feels soft, no tenderness. Okay, Derick, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Don’t tell me I’m dropping dead, eh? I’ve lived a long life, but I’d like to stay around a bit longer, if possible. Just tell me straight, Doctor. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Derick, you're not dropping dead, I can assure you of that. But what I'm seeing—the swelling in your legs and face, the slight congestion in your lungs, the elevated blood pressure—suggests we need to investigate a bit further. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it's possible you're experiencing something called congestive heart failure. Now, before you panic, let me explain. It doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is about to stop. It means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should be, causing fluid to build up in your body. That's what's causing the swelling and shortness of breath. It’s common in people as they get older, especially with a history of high blood pressure. However, there are other possibilities too. It could be a kidney problem, or even a problem with your liver. To figure out exactly what’s going on, I’m going to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will check your kidney function, liver function, and look for certain markers that indicate heart failure. The chest X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid buildup in your lungs. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Congestive…heart failure? Goodness gracious. That sounds… serious. My heart? But I haven't felt any chest pain or anything. And I haven't been feeling that bad, just a little tired and puffy. But blood tests and an X-ray… alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But what if it is my heart? What happens then? Will I have to go to the hospital? And will I be able to… well, will I be able to keep my home? I’ve lived here for fifty years, you know. It all sounds a bit… overwhelming, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is a bit overwhelming, I understand. And it's completely normal to feel anxious when you hear something like that. Let’s take things one step at a time. The tests will give us more information, and we won't jump to any conclusions until we have the results. If it is heart failure, there are many things we can do to manage it. It often involves medication to help your heart pump more efficiently and reduce fluid buildup. There are also lifestyle changes we can make, like reducing your salt intake and getting regular exercise. As for the hospital, it depends on the severity. Mild cases can often be managed at home with medication and regular check-ups. More severe cases might require a short stay in the hospital to get things under control. And about your home… that’s a very valid concern. We'll do everything we can to help you stay in your home. The goal is to get you feeling better and improve your quality of life, and that includes maintaining your independence. We can connect you with social workers who can help with any support you might need. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. I'll write you a requisition for the blood work and an order for the chest X-ray. You can get those done at the lab and radiology department at the hospital. They’ll schedule you for the X-ray when you go in. It’s important to get these done as soon as possible, so we can get a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you have any trouble getting to the hospital, or would you like me to help arrange transportation?
PATIENT: Transportation… well, old man Henderson used to give me a ride, but he moved away last year. And I don’t drive anymore. I suppose I could take a taxi, but it’s expensive. And I don't like bothering people. But I suppose I have no choice, do I? Alright, alright. Do the tests. And tell me… how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks, worrying myself sick.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually come back within a few days, and the X-ray report should be available shortly after that. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you within three business days to let you know when the results are ready. Then, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I can also write you a prescription for a mild diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce some of the fluid buildup while we're waiting for the results. It won’t cure anything, but it might make you feel a little more comfortable. And don’t worry about bothering anyone. It’s my job to help you, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way. Here’s the requisition for the blood work and X-ray, and here’s the prescription for the diuretic. Sarah will also give you some information about the social work services available. Do you have any questions for me right now before you go?
PATIENT: A diuretic… a water pill. Sounds… complicated. And will it have any side effects? I don’t need any more problems, Doctor. And the social work services… what do they even do? I’ve always been a pretty independent fella, you know. But I suppose… I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to have some information, just in case. Alright. I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll get those tests done as soon as possible. And I’ll try not to worry… too much. .
DOCTOR: Of course. The diuretic is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have some side effects. The most common one is increased urination, which is why it’s important to stay hydrated. You might also experience some dizziness or lightheadedness, so it’s important to get up slowly from a sitting position. The information sheet Sarah gives you will have a more detailed list of potential side effects. As for the social work services, they can help with a wide range of things, from transportation and financial assistance to emotional support and connecting you with community resources. They’re there to help you navigate any challenges you might be facing. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. Sarah and I are here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Derick. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
