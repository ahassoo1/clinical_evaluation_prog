DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin' to ye, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, see. Been happenin' every mornin' now for…oh, must be a couple o' weeks. Not pleasant at all, it isn’t. And the nurse mentioned somethin' about my heart when I was fillin' out the forms, so I figured it best to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea for a couple of weeks, and concern about your heart. We'll definitely look into both. Let's start with the nausea. Can you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, right. Well, it's not like… violent sicknin', if ye ken what I mean. More like a really unsettled stomach, a proper rollin' feelin'. And then, well, I just don't fancy anythin' to eat, ye know? Usually happens as soon as I sit up in the bed. Sometimes it passes after a wee bit, but other times it lingers all mornin'. It’s been makin' it hard to get goin' with the day, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of a queasy, unsettled feeling that happens soon after getting out of bed, and it impacts your appetite. Does anything seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I haven’t really noticed anythin' specific makin' it worse, no. But a wee bit of ginger ale sometimes helps settle it down. Not always, mind ye, but it's worth a try. And lyin' back down usually does the trick eventually, but I can’t spend all day in bed, can I?
DOCTOR: Right, ginger ale offers some relief, and lying down helps. And you're understandably wanting to get on with your day. Let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, well, now that ye mention it… I have been feelin' a bit more breathless than usual, particularly when I’m walkin’ up the hill to the shops. It's not terrible, but I definitely need to take more pauses than I used to. And my ankles… they’ve been a bit swollen at the end of the day. I just thought it was the heat, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve noticed some shortness of breath, especially with exertion, and some ankle swelling. The heat could be contributing, but we need to consider other possibilities. Now, regarding your heart… have you ever been diagnosed with any heart problems before?
PATIENT: Aye, I was told years ago, maybe fifteen, twenty years back, that I had somethin' called… congestive heart failure. I don't claim to remember all the details, it was a right blur. They put me on some tablets, I took 'em for a bit, but then I started feelin' better and the doctor said I could come off 'em. I haven't really been back to see a specialist since. I just try to take it easy, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous diagnosis of congestive heart failure, and you were able to discontinue medication. That’s important information. Do you remember what medication you were taking at the time?
PATIENT: Och, that’s the tricky bit. My memory isn't what it used to be. I think... I think it was somethin' white and small? And I took it every mornin'. I really wish I could remember the name, but it's just gone. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really payin' much attention to the details then. I just did as I was told.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to apologize. It was a long time ago. We’ll work with what we have. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual painkiller now and then for my arthritis. A couple of paracetamol when my knees are playin' up, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. And I take a cod liver oil capsule in the winter, for the vitamins, but I ran out a couple o’ months ago and haven’t gotten around to replacin' it yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol for arthritis as needed, and you recently stopped taking cod liver oil. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothin' I know of. Never had any trouble with any tablets or such. And I don't have any allergies to food or…well, nothin' that I’m aware of, anyway. My wife used to always say I’d eat anything put in front of me! She passed a few years back, so I don't have anyone to remind me of anythin' now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Aye, my father had a bad ticker, he did. Spent the last few years of his life with chest pains and shortness o’ breath, much like myself, really. And my sister, bless her soul, had diabetes, though she lived down south, so I didn’t see her much. My mother was always fit as a fiddle, though. Never a day's illness in her life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with heart problems and a sister with diabetes. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Aye, right. Well, I live alone in a cottage just outside the village. I used to be a librarian, but I'm retired now. I spend most o' my time readin', tendin' to the garden, and walkin’ the dog – a wee terrier named Hamish. I don't smoke, never have, and I only have a wee dram of whisky in the evenin's, for warmth, ye ken.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired librarian, live alone, enjoy reading and gardening, walk the dog, no smoking, and a small amount of whisky. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine by me, Doctor. Do whatever ye need to do. I'm used to bein' poked and prodded these days, it seems! Just be gentle with the ankles, they’re a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 160/90. I’m hearing some crackles in your lungs, and your heart sounds a little…irregular. And yes, your ankles do have some swelling, and are tender to the touch. I'm also noticing some mild pitting edema – meaning the swelling remains for a few seconds after I press on your skin. We're going to need to get some further tests done to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m going to order a blood test, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Och, that doesn't sound too good, does it? Crackles and irregular… and what was that last bit now? Pitting…something? It all sounds a bit serious. I ken it’s probably somethin' to do with the heart, what with my father and all. And the blood tests… will they tell me much? I suppose ye'll let me ken what it all means when ye get the results?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Benic, and it’s good you're asking questions. The "pitting edema" just means that when I press on your ankles, there’s fluid that remains there for a moment, which can be a sign of fluid build-up related to heart problems. The blood tests will give us information about your kidney function, electrolytes, and levels of certain proteins that can indicate how well your heart is working. The EKG will record the electrical activity of your heart, which will help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of damage. The chest X-ray will let us look at your lungs and heart size. We need to rule out a few things, and these tests will help us do that. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions at this point, but based on your symptoms and the initial exam, we need to investigate this further. I'll get the orders sent to the lab, and they'll contact you to schedule the tests. Do you have transportation to the lab?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, at least. Thank ye for explainin' it all so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate it. And no, I haven’t got any transport myself. Hamish and I walk everywhere. I suppose I could ask Mrs. MacIntyre down the road, she's a kind soul and always willing to help. Will she need anythin' special, like a note or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll write a note for Mrs. MacIntyre explaining the tests and that you’ll need a ride. And I'll also put in a request for a social worker to assist with transport if Mrs. MacIntyre is unavailable. It’s important that you get these tests done as soon as possible. I'll also want to check your medication list again, even though you said you don't take much. Sometimes people forget things, and it's important we have an accurate record. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan of action. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s very kind of ye to arrange that, Doctor. I’m much obliged. And ye’re right about the forgetfulness, I do sometimes misremember things… perhaps I should write a list myself! No, I think that covers everything for now. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. My father was quite poorly, ye ken. Thank ye again, Doctor. I’ll be waitin' for the lab to call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. It’s understandable to be worried, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We’ll take things one step at a time. The lab should contact you within the next couple of days to schedule the tests. If you don’t hear from them by Thursday, please give the clinic a call, and we’ll follow up for you. Take care of yourself and Hamish. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.
