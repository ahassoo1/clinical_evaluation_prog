DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, my tummy feels… big. And I don't feel like eating much these days. Not like I used to, anyway. It’s just… not very good. I don’t remember much else, to be honest. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details. We’ll take things slowly. "Tummy feels big" and a decreased appetite… those are good starting points. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your tummy feeling bigger?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… when did I notice? That's a tricky one. A while now, I think. Maybe… a few weeks? Or months? Time… it all gets mixed up, you know? It wasn't sudden, not like bam overnight. Just… slowly bigger. And I’m always tired, now that I think about it. Very tired.
DOCTOR: A few weeks or months, gradually getting bigger… and you’ve also been feeling more tired lately. Thank you. It’s helpful to have that timeframe, even if it's approximate. When you say “tired,” could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… hard to explain. Not just sleepy, you see. It’s like… everything takes so much effort. Getting out of the chair, walking to the kitchen… even talking sometimes feels tiring. It’s like I have no… pep. No energy. And I sleep a lot, but it doesn't help much. I wake up still feeling… drained. Is that making sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. Feeling drained even after sleeping – that’s very important information. It sounds like you're experiencing significant fatigue. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Hmm… well, it hasn’t been… regular, I suppose. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. And when I do… it’s… different. Harder, maybe? I don’t know. It’s not something I pay much attention to, if you don't mind me saying. Old lady problems, I always think. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. McConnon, and you’re right to mention it. Changes in bowel habits can tell us a lot. So, it's been less regular, and the stool itself feels harder. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with these changes?
PATIENT: Oh my… nausea? I don’t think so. Not really. I haven't… thrown up. And my tummy… it doesn't hurt exactly. It's more like… uncomfortable. Bloated, maybe? And sometimes… a little bit of cramping. But not bad, you know? Nothing I'd complain about. I get a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just the tea I drink. Does that make sense? Is heartburn… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. No nausea or vomiting, just discomfort, bloating, and some mild cramping. And the heartburn is likely related to the tea. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… medical history. That was a long time ago, Doctor. I went to the doctor when I was younger, of course. But I don't remember what they said, exactly. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? And something with my heart, but it wasn’t serious. I took some pills for a while, but I stopped a long time ago. I just… try to eat healthy and take it easy. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, many, many years. Sorry. I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details. Many people don't. High blood pressure and something with the heart… that’s helpful to know. We can try to access some older records if you’re comfortable with that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Nothing at all. I stopped taking everything a long time ago. I figured… if I felt okay, I didn't need them. I drink my tea, of course. And sometimes I take a little honey for my throat. But that’s it. No pills. No fancy supplements. Just tea and honey. And maybe a biscuit if I’m lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Just tea and honey. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of, dear. I’ve eaten everything over the years, and never had a problem. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose in the springtime, but that’s just the flowers, I think. Not a real allergy. And I've never had a reaction to any medicine, as far as I remember. I’m a pretty sturdy old lady, you see. Never been one for complaining.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. McConnon. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members have had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a hard one, dear. My family… they’re all gone now. My mother… she died when I was young. And my father… I don’t remember much about him. And I never had any siblings. I don’t know… I don’t think anyone had anything serious. Just… old age, I suppose. Everyone died of old age. Sorry, I wish I could be more help. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s understandable that you don’t remember. It's okay not to know. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Smoke? Never! My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. And alcohol… maybe a little sip of wine at Christmas, when I was younger. But I haven’t had a drink in… oh, decades. And drugs? Absolutely not! I’m a respectable lady, you see. I never touched anything like that. Just tea and biscuits.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. McConnon. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… alright. Whatever you need to do. My tummy… it doesn't hurt, but it does feel… funny. Bloated, like I said. But I trust you, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do to figure out what’s wrong. Just be gentle, please. I'm an old lady, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but definitely distended, and I notice some tenderness when I press down here on your lower left side and lower right side. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common at your age. I’m going to ask you to lie down on the examination table so I can listen more carefully. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. A little slow, but I can manage. There we go. A little cold, but alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I’m trusting you to figure out what's wrong with this old tummy. Is it bad? Is it something serious? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your bowel sounds are quiet. That's not ideal. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen in a few different places. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Alright. Based on the exam, there’s some tenderness in your lower abdomen and a noticeable distension, along with the diminished bowel sounds. The faint heart sounds are also something to note. It's difficult to say exactly what's going on without further investigation, but it could be something relatively minor, like constipation, or something more serious, like a blockage or an issue with one of your organs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work and an abdominal X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work and an X-ray? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it bad? Is it something awful? I don't like needles, you know. And I don’t want to be poked and prodded. What are you looking for? Will it hurt? I just want to feel better. I'm an old lady, I don’t want any trouble. Can't you just give me something for my tummy? Something to help me feel… normal again?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be worried, Ms. McConnon. It’s completely understandable. I wouldn't order these tests if I didn't think they were necessary to figure out what's going on. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. The X-ray will allow us to see what’s happening inside your abdomen and rule out any blockages. I know needles aren’t pleasant, and we'll be as gentle as possible. And the X-ray doesn't involve any poking or prodding – you’ll just need to stand still for a few moments. We're not jumping to any conclusions, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It’s just a precaution to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. I'm hoping it’s something relatively simple, like constipation, and we can get you feeling better soon. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it’s necessary… explain them to me. But slowly, please. My old brain doesn’t work so well anymore. What exactly will they do with the blood? And what will the X-ray show? Will it… will it hurt? I’m just so scared, Doctor. I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to feel… myself again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. We’ll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood work involves taking a small sample of your blood – usually from your arm. It will be sent to a laboratory, where they’ll analyze it to check for things like your red and white blood cell counts, electrolyte levels, and any signs of inflammation or infection. It helps us see how well your organs are functioning and if anything is out of the ordinary. It’s a very common test and usually doesn’t take long. The X-ray involves using a small amount of radiation to create an image of the inside of your abdomen. You’ll stand or lie down in front of the X-ray machine, and the technician will take a few pictures. It doesn’t hurt at all – it’s like having a quick photograph taken. It allows us to see your organs, bones, and any potential blockages or abnormalities. I understand you’re scared, and it’s perfectly alright to feel that way. But these tests will help us figure out what’s going on and get you the right treatment to feel better. We're not jumping to any conclusions, and I'll be here every step of the way to explain the results and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions about either of these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… radiation? Is it… is it safe? Will it make me sick? My neighbor, Elsie, she had radiation for her cancer, and she got very sick. I don’t want to get sick, Doctor. I’m too old for that. And… what if you find something bad? What if it’s something… serious? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to feel better, you know? Is there anything else we can do? Anything at all? Maybe just some medicine for my tummy?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be concerned about the radiation, Ms. McConnon. I understand your worry, especially hearing about Elsie. However, the amount of radiation from an abdominal X-ray is very, very small – significantly less than what’s used for cancer treatment. It’s considered a very safe procedure, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. It’s unlikely to cause any harm at all. And I understand your concerns about finding something bad. It’s always scary to think about. But even if we do find something, knowing what it is allows us to create a plan to address it. We’ll discuss all your options and make sure you’re comfortable every step of the way. Before we proceed with the tests, let's talk about other options. While medication can help with some of your symptoms, like bloating, it won’t address the underlying cause. Without knowing what’s going on, we’re just treating the symptoms, not the problem. I do want to be clear, though, that given your age and symptoms, it's important to rule out anything serious. I am hoping it’s something relatively minor, but we need to be thorough. Would you like me to call a family member or friend to sit with you while we do the tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no family, Doctor. They’re all gone, like I said. And my friends… well, they’re not well enough to come. I’m all alone, you see. But… I suppose if it’s important… if it’s really necessary… I’ll do the tests. But please be gentle, Doctor. And tell me everything you find, okay? I don’t want any surprises. Just… be honest with me. And please don’t leave me alone for too long. I get scared, you see.
DOCTOR: You are not alone, Ms. McConnon. I will be here with you every step of the way. And I promise to be as gentle and honest as possible. We will take things slowly, and I will explain everything we find in a way you understand. Okay. Let's start with the blood work. I'll have the nurse come in and draw a few vials of blood. It will take just a few minutes, and she's very skilled. Then, we’ll do the X-ray. It will only take a few moments to get the image. I will stay with you during both procedures and explain everything as we go. And after the tests, we’ll sit down together and discuss the results. I’ll call the nurse now. Is there anything I can get you before we start?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Nothing, thank you. Just… just be gentle, okay? And… tell me if it will hurt. I don’t want any surprises. I’m trusting you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. I will explain everything as we go, and I will let you know if anything will hurt, even if it’s just a little pinch. I understand your worry, and I will do everything I can to make you feel comfortable. Nurse Patel, could you come in for a moment, please?
PATIENT: .
