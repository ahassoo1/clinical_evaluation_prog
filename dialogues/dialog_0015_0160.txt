DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s this tiredness. It’s just… getting worse. And it’s not like I’ve been lounging around, you know. I work. Physical therapy aide, keeps me busy. But even after a full night, I feel drained. And… well, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Clay, mostly. I know it sounds crazy.
DOCTOR: Eating… clay?
PATIENT: Yes, clay. Like, from the garden. It started small, just a little bit when I was out weeding. Now… now I find myself wanting it. It’s… hard to explain. It just feels… right. Though I know it isn’t right. That's why I'm here, I suppose. Don't tell me it's some kind of mental thing. I'm perfectly sensible.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to understand what's going on. This… craving for clay, that's unusual. We call that pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Before we jump to conclusions, I need to get a more detailed history. You mentioned tiredness… Can you describe that further?
PATIENT: Oh, “detailed history.” Just get on with it. It's just… everything feels heavy. Like I'm wading through mud. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. And it’s not just physical, though that’s bad enough. I feel… foggy. Can't concentrate. Forget names, sometimes. Though, honestly, I remember things very clearly when I want to. It’s just… this general… blah-ness. I’ve been trying to push through it, but it's getting harder and harder. And this dirt-eating… it started around the same time, didn’t it?
DOCTOR: “Foggy,” and difficulty concentrating...and the clay craving coinciding with the fatigue. Alright. Let's start with the fatigue. When did this begin, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It was… oh, around last November, I'd say. Maybe October. Right after that terrible rain we had. Everything was damp and grey. It started gradually, just feeling a little more tired than usual. But it's steadily gotten worse since then. November, definitely. Don't ask me the exact date. I don't keep a diary. And frankly, I have better things to worry about than remembering when I started feeling tired.
DOCTOR: October/November… coinciding with the period of heavy rain. And it's been progressively worsening. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. Well, my appetite’s been… off. Not much hunger, really. And I've been a bit… constipated, if you must know. It's unpleasant to talk about. And I’ve been colder than usual. Even with a sweater on. Though that could just be old age. I’m 79, you know. Things start to… shut down. But the tiredness is the worst part. Makes everything else seem… irrelevant. And the dirt. Don’t forget the dirt. It’s rather humiliating, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, constipation, feeling colder… alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, don't even start with that. Chronic conditions. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A long life. I've had the usual aches and pains, but nothing… serious. My mother had some trouble with her joints, arthritis I think, but I haven't had any major illnesses. I used to have a bit of trouble with my digestion, but that sorted itself out years ago. Honestly, I'm a remarkably healthy woman for my age. It's just this… this fatigue and the… peculiarity. I’m not insured, either, so please don’t start suggesting expensive tests right away.
DOCTOR: No chronic medical conditions… Alright. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… years ago, when I was quite a bit younger, I had my tonsils taken out. That’s all. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle, but that hardly counts. It healed just fine. Nothing else. I've always been very careful to avoid hospitals if at all possible. Dreadful places, full of germs and… negativity. Honestly, I'd rather just deal with things on my own. But this…this is getting beyond me. And I really can't continue with this… earth-eating. It’s just…undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, that’s a long story. My mother lived to be 92, but she was a bit… eccentric. Always talking to plants. My father was a farmer, strong as an ox, died of a heart attack when he was 75. Several of my aunts and uncles had high blood pressure, I think. They didn't talk much about their health. Farmers aren’t ones for complaining. It’s all rather vague, to be honest. And frankly, I doubt it's relevant. I'm a unique case, you see. This isn't just some inherited condition. It's… something else. Honestly, I just want to know what’s making me feel so tired and…compelled to eat dirt. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. And I don't drink either, except for a small glass of sherry on special occasions. Though I haven’t had sherry in months. Just haven’t been feeling up to it. And I live alone, if that’s what you’re asking. Always have, really. Independent woman, you see. Always have been. But even independent women get tired, apparently. And start craving…unconventional things. Honestly, this is all very undignified. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol… Lives alone. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. I don't believe in relying on pills for everything. A good night’s sleep and a healthy diet is all you need. Though, as I said, my appetite’s been off. I used to take a calcium supplement for my bones, but I stopped when I ran out a few months ago. Didn't see much point. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very simple woman. I don't need a lot of fancy medications or treatments. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask? And stop eating dirt, of course. That's the main thing. This is all rather embarrassing, you know. And I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. So, to summarize: fatigue beginning around November, coinciding with heavy rain, progressive worsening. Decreased appetite, constipation, feeling colder. No chronic medical conditions, no surgeries, some family history of high blood pressure, no smoking or alcohol use, no current medications or supplements. And… a craving for clay. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. Can we start with your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. Get on with it then. The sooner we find out what's wrong, the sooner I can stop eating dirt. Blood pressure and pulse, you say? Very well. Just try to be quick about it, won’t you? I have errands to run. And a garden to tend, assuming I ever get my energy back. Though at this rate, the weeds will have taken over the entire neighborhood. Honestly, this is all very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs as well. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 76, regular. A bit elevated, but not dramatically so. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds… Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly distended… Can you describe the color of the clay you've been eating?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, now you want to know the color of the dirt? Honestly! It’s… reddish-brown, mostly. From the garden soil. It’s not like I’m eating fancy kaolin clay, you know. Just regular earth. It’s… grainy, of course. And a bit… earthy, if you can imagine. I wouldn’t recommend it, honestly. Though, I suppose it’s not the worst thing I’ve ever tasted. But that’s not the point! The point is, why am I craving it? And why am I so tired? Are you getting anywhere with this, Doctor? This is all very frustrating. And frankly, I'm starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Slightly tender in the lower abdomen... Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and your neurological function. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. No gross neurological deficits… Do you have any history of anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? Goodness, no. Never been diagnosed with anemia. Though, my mother was always a bit pale, if I remember correctly. Always talking to plants, as I said. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very confusing. You’re asking me about my mother now? What does my mother have to do with my fatigue and my dirt-eating? Are you even listening to me? I just want to know what’s wrong with me. And I’d like to know it quickly, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day, you know. This is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your frustration. However, I need to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause of your symptoms. Your history of fatigue, the unusual clay craving, slightly diminished reflexes, and your mother's pale complexion could all be indicative of an iron deficiency anemia. The clay eating, known as pica, is often associated with this. However, we need to confirm this with blood work. I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to rule out other possibilities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Honestly! I eat a perfectly good diet. Though my appetite has been off, admittedly. Blood work… fine. Just get it over with. The sooner I know what’s wrong, the sooner I can stop eating dirt. But don’t expect miracles. I’m 79 years old. Things start to… wear out. Just find out what’s making me tired, and then… then tell me what I need to do. And please, be quick about it. I have errands to run. And a garden to tend, if I ever get my energy back. Honestly, this whole ordeal is very frustrating. And undignified. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Understood. I’ll have the lab draw blood now. It will take approximately 15-20 minutes. After the results are available, we will discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding eating the clay. It can potentially cause intestinal obstruction or lead to other complications. I'll also order a stool sample to rule out any parasites or infections. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Parasites? Good heavens, no! I've never had any trouble with parasites. And as for the stool sample… honestly! Must you investigate everything? No, I don't have any questions. Just get the blood work done. And then tell me what’s wrong. Avoid the dirt…yes, yes, I understand. It's hardly a pleasure to eat, anyway. Just… get on with it, Doctor. I haven’t got all day. And frankly, I'm starting to feel quite faint again. Honestly, this whole ordeal is… distressing. Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: The lab technician will be right in. Please remain seated. After the blood draw, I recommend sitting quietly for a few minutes. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and will be back to discuss them with you. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Good heavens, no! I’ll be fine. Just get the blood work done. And then tell me what's wrong. Abdominal pain… dizziness… honestly! I'm 79 years old, not a delicate flower. Yes, it's clear. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to sit down. This whole ordeal is… exhausting. And undignified. Just… hurry up, please.
