DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. They said I need this. A physical, yes? Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. A physical to get everything sorted for your Medicare coverage. Perfect. Just to confirm, your date of birth is…?
PATIENT: My date of birth is… November 12th, 1996. Is that what you need? It is… a strange thing to ask, no? You have my papers.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, I do! It’s just a standard part of the process, verifying everything. Apologies for the redundancy. Okay, November 12th, 1996. And before we get started, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My mother made sure I was strong. Dust maybe? Like everyone. But not… a serious allergy. Like to… peanuts or medicine. No. I am a strong man.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I do not take… pills. Not unless I am sick, and even then, only what the pharmacy gives me. I eat well. A healthy diet is better than anything from a bottle. My cousin tried those… vitamins. Waste of money, he said. He still got sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications or supplements. That’s helpful. Now, just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? I have not been… often to the doctor. When I was small, maybe. Chickenpox, I think. And a broken arm when I was playing football with my friends. Nothing serious. I am generally… healthy. I work hard. That is good for the body, yes?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no major illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays that you recall?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I cut myself sometimes at the factory, but my wife – she used to be my wife – she would clean it. Bandaids. That is all. It is… a food processing job. It happens. Not a big problem. Are we done now? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Almost done with the history part. Just a few more quick questions. Have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any serious health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: My father… he had problems with his back. From working the land, I think. Very heavy work. He is… old now. And my mother… she is fine. Strong woman. My brother, he is… healthy. He sells carpets. He travels a lot. I do not think anyone else had… serious things. We do not talk about that. It is bad luck to speak of sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of back problems, otherwise generally healthy. Thanks for sharing that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just the usual – checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and things like that. Will that work?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. The exam. Fine. But quickly, please. I have things to do. And do not poke too much. I am a strong man, I do not like to be… handled. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I'll be as efficient as possible. Just a routine check-up. If you could just hop up on the table for me, we’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. This is not comfortable. And tell me what you are doing, so I know you are not… wasting time. I do not like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just wrapping the cuff around your arm. This measures your blood pressure – it tells us how hard your heart is working. Just relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. …Okay, that’s 130 over 85. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe deeply in and out. Everything sounds clear, no wheezing or crackling. Good.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I told you I am a strong man. My heart is strong. I lift heavy boxes all day. It should be strong. And please, stop poking me. It is… unsettling. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, we can stop there. Elevated just means it's a little higher than the ideal range, and it can be normal for someone who is physically active. Lifting heavy boxes does put extra strain on your heart. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something wrong, but it’s something we want to monitor. Now, just to finish up, do you have any concerns or anything you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I am concerned about how long this is taking. And that you keep saying "elevated." It sounds… bad. Is my insurance going to be more expensive? That is my concern. Is everything alright with the paperwork? Will it be approved? That is what I want to know. I do not need you listening to my heart. I need my insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's focus on the insurance. Your paperwork looks complete, and everything should be fine for approval. The slightly elevated blood pressure shouldn't affect that. It just means we might want to check it again in a few months. I'm going to make a note to follow up with you in three months for a repeat blood pressure check. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Three months? That is… acceptable. As long as it does not cost me money. And as long as it does not affect the insurance. Just make sure everything is correct. Do I need to come back here? Or can this be done… somewhere else? Somewhere faster? I have work to do, you know. My supervisor is not patient.
DOCTOR: Yes, you would need to come back here for the follow-up. It’s best to use the same equipment for accurate comparison. Here’s a card with the appointment scheduled for November 2nd at 10:00 AM. It shouldn’t take long, just a quick blood pressure check. And to answer your question, this elevated reading shouldn't affect your insurance coverage. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: November 2nd… fine. But if it takes too long, I will not wait. No. That is all. I have wasted enough time here already. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, have a good day, Kiwane. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
