DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... well, it's this ear trouble, I suppose. It comes and goes, you see. And my daughter, bless her heart, she worried something fierce about it, with my family history and all. It's just… a bit unsettling, really. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Ear trouble can be quite unsettling, and it's wise of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out, especially with a family history to consider. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's been going on. When you say it “comes and goes,” could you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it’s like… everything just spins. Not all the time, mind you. It's more like a wave, suddenly everything is going round and round, and I feel terribly sick. And my hearing… it just goes. Like someone turned off the volume. Then, after a bit, it comes back, and the spinning stops. It's not painful, thankfully, just… very disorienting. It makes it hard to even stand up sometimes. I don't remember how long each episode lasts, though. Sorry. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's common for the duration of events to be a bit unclear when you're not feeling well. So, to clarify, you experience episodes of dizziness—a spinning sensation—accompanied by a temporary loss of hearing. And these episodes aren’t constant, they come and go. Now, does anything trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a hard one. I honestly don't know. I’ve tried to think about it, but nothing really jumps out at me. Sometimes it happens when I'm just sitting and relaxing, other times when I'm out and about. I do enjoy a bit of… well, a bit of gambling, you know? At the club. But it doesn't seem to be linked to that, not that I’ve noticed. It just… happens. It's frustrating, really. I wish I could pinpoint something.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Mayhugh. It's helpful to rule things out, but sometimes these things just don't have a clear trigger. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the dizziness and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes, when the spinning stops, I feel a bit… shaky. And a little bit nauseous, even if I don't actually be sick. And I suppose I've been a bit more tired lately, but that could just be my age, couldn't it? I don't know. It’s hard to say what’s normal anymore. Oh, and maybe a little bit of ringing in my ears sometimes, but that comes and goes too, just like everything else. It's not constant, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so in addition to the dizziness, hearing loss, and shakiness, you’ve also noticed some nausea, fatigue, and intermittent ringing in your ears. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they got it under control with some pills. And I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. But other than that… not really. I’ve been generally healthy, all my life. I mean, aside from this ear business, of course. I do take a little something for my arthritis now and then, but that’s about it, I think. It’s hard to remember all these things. My daughter keeps track of most of it, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Mayhugh. So, you've been treated for high blood pressure in the past, you had your gallbladder removed, and you currently take medication for arthritis. And just to confirm, what medications are you taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... now that I don’t remember. It’s a little white pill, I think. Maybe two little white pills. I just take them when my joints are acting up. I get them from the pharmacy, you know? I really should write these things down, shouldn't I? My daughter gets annoyed with me for forgetting. She says it's important for the doctor to know. I'll have to ask her when I get home. I'm sorry, I’m not much help with this, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re not causing any trouble at all, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly understandable to have trouble remembering medication names. We can certainly get that information from your daughter later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat all sorts of things, you know? And I've taken plenty of pills over the years. No allergies. I’m pretty sure. But I suppose you should ask my daughter, just to be safe. She’s very thorough, that girl. Always worrying about me.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will certainly follow up with your daughter. Now, Ms. Mayhugh, has anyone in your family had problems with their ears, balance, or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. My mother, bless her soul, she had terrible trouble with dizziness when she got older. And I think my uncle… on my father’s side… he had some hearing problems. They said it was something to do with the little bones in his ear. And my cousin, she had ringing in her ears for years. So, yes, there's a bit of ear trouble in the family, you see. That's why my daughter was so worried. She said it could be hereditary. It's all a bit confusing, really.
DOCTOR: That is helpful to know, Ms. Mayhugh. A family history of ear problems does increase our suspicion. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… well, he used to smoke, but he gave it up years ago. I always told him it was a terrible habit. I prefer a nice cup of tea, you see. Much healthier. And I try to eat a balanced diet, although I do enjoy a bit of a treat now and then. A little bit of cake, you know? Can't deprive oneself entirely, can one?
DOCTOR: Certainly not! Moderation is key. And do you drink alcohol, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, or a small sherry. Not very often, though. I don't really have a strong head for it, you see. And I don't want to interfere with my pills. Just a little sip now and then, that's all. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. And finally, do you engage in any recreational activities, such as gambling, that may have any impact on your health?
PATIENT: Oh, yes... well, I do enjoy a bit of a flutter at the club, you know? The casino. I like the slots, mostly. It's just a bit of fun, really. A way to pass the time. It doesn't cause me any stress, I assure you. I don't go overboard, and I certainly don't spend more than I can afford. It's just… a little hobby. But I suppose you need to know everything, don't you? My daughter worries about that too, sometimes. She says it's a waste of money, but it keeps me entertained. It's not affecting my health, though, I promise.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Mayhugh. I appreciate you sharing all of this information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will involve looking in your ears, checking your balance, and listening to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I've been to doctors plenty of times in my life, so I'm used to it. Just… be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive, you see. And I get a bit dizzy easily. But go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? And get back to my normal life.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with your ears. I see a bit of cerumen – earwax – present, but no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Same here, some cerumen, but everything appears normal. Now, could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Oh dear… I’m a bit unsteady, Doctor. It’s hard to balance, you see. I always have been. It’s probably just my age. Don’t mind me, Doctor. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's not uncommon to have some difficulty with balance, especially when you close your eyes. I do notice a slight sway, and you do require some support to maintain your balance. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, that concludes the physical examination. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, I suspect you may be experiencing a condition called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV for short. This is a relatively common cause of dizziness, and it's often triggered by changes in head position. The cerumen buildup could also be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... BPPV? That sounds awfully complicated, Doctor. Is it serious? And what does that even mean? And cerumen… is that just earwax? I don’t understand all the medical terms, you see. Is it something I need pills for? Or is there something else I need to do? I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. It’s unsettling, you know, feeling so dizzy all the time. Can you explain it to me in plain English, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. Let’s break it down in plain English. BPPV simply means that there are tiny crystals in your inner ear that have become dislodged and are interfering with your balance. Think of it like little pebbles getting into a delicate mechanism. This causes dizziness when you move your head in certain positions. It's not serious in the sense that it’s not life-threatening, but it can certainly be disruptive. And yes, cerumen is just the medical term for earwax. It’s perfectly normal to have earwax, but a buildup can sometimes contribute to dizziness and hearing problems. Now, to confirm my suspicion, I would like to perform a specific test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This involves quickly moving your head to different positions to see if it triggers your dizziness. It’s a bit uncomfortable, but it will help us confirm the diagnosis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear... quickly moving my head? That sounds rather frightening, Doctor. I already get dizzy just standing up, you know. I don't know... is it absolutely necessary? Couldn't we just… try cleaning out the earwax first? Maybe that would solve the problem. I'm a bit worried about making the dizziness worse, you see. I’m not very good with sudden movements. Is there another way to find out what’s wrong, Doctor? Perhaps some sort of scan? I really don’t like the sound of quickly moving my head.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask questions and express your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. Your comfort is my priority. You are right, we could start with cleaning out the earwax. That's a good first step, and it might alleviate some of your symptoms. However, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the most accurate way to diagnose BPPV. It doesn’t usually cause any lasting harm, but I completely understand your apprehension. We could also consider a referral to an audiologist for a hearing test and balance assessment. That would give us more information about your inner ear function without requiring any sudden movements. Would you be more comfortable with that option?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds much better, Doctor. A hearing test and balance assessment… without any sudden movements. That's exactly what I was hoping for. I’m not very good with things that involve spinning or quickly moving my head, you see. I get terribly anxious. So, yes, please, a referral to an audiologist would be wonderful. And then, perhaps we can talk about cleaning out the earwax? I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. And I’m so glad you’re listening to my concerns. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m happy to accommodate your preferences. I will write a referral for you to see a reputable audiologist in the area. They will perform a comprehensive hearing test and balance assessment to help us determine the cause of your dizziness. In the meantime, we can proceed with cerumen removal. I can perform this in the office today. It involves gently irrigating your ears with warm water to dislodge the earwax. It's usually a quick and painless procedure. Would you like to proceed with that now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. If you think it will help, Doctor, let's do it. I’m willing to try anything to feel better. As long as it doesn’t involve any sudden movements, of course. And it’s quick and painless, you say? That’s good. I’m a bit nervous, but I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me what you’re doing every step of the way. I don’t like surprises, you see. Just… gentle and slow, and tell me what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. Gentle and slow, and I will explain every step of the process. Alright, so what I'm going to do is gently warm some water to body temperature. Then, using a syringe, I will carefully irrigate your ear canal with the warm water. This will help to soften and dislodge the earwax. You may feel a slight sensation of fullness or pressure in your ear, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. Alright, I’m now gently irrigating your left ear with warm water. Do you feel any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh... it’s a bit strange, Doctor. A bit of a swirling sensation, you see. And a little bit of pressure, like something is moving. Not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. Just a little bit unsettling. Is it normal to feel like that? And how long will it take? I just want it to be over quickly, you know? It's making me a bit anxious, Doctor. But I’m trusting you. Just... let me know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Ms. Mayhugh. The swirling sensation and pressure are signs that the water is softening and dislodging the earwax. It’s a good sign! It usually takes just a few minutes per ear. I'm continuing to gently irrigate your ear canal. You may notice some wax draining out soon. It’s perfectly normal. We'll repeat the process on the other ear shortly. Just try to relax, and let me know if you experience any discomfort at any time. Alright, let's take a look… Ah, good. I see some wax draining out, and the ear canal is looking much clearer now. We’ll repeat the process on your right ear.
PATIENT: Oh, good! Clearer, you say? That's wonderful. I am glad we’re making progress. Just get it over with quickly, Doctor, alright? My right ear is a bit more sensitive, you see. And I don't like the feeling of water in my ear. But I’m trusting you. Just… gentle and quick, alright? And tell me what you’re doing every step of the way. I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. It’s unsettling, you know, feeling so off-balance.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. Gentle and quick, and I will explain every step of the process. I’ll be extra careful with your right ear, knowing it’s a bit more sensitive. Alright, I'm now gently irrigating your right ear with warm water. Do you feel any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a bit more uncomfortable this time, Doctor. A bit of pressure, and a strange tingling sensation. It's not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. And a bit of dizziness, now that you mention it. Just a little bit, but noticeable. Can we stop soon, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious. Just a little bit more, and then we can stop, alright? Please?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. Absolutely. We will stop immediately. Your comfort is my priority. Alright, that's enough for today. We don't want to cause any further discomfort. Let's take a look… Ah, good. I see some wax draining out, and the ear canal is looking much clearer now, although not as clear as the other ear. Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We've removed a significant amount of wax from both ears. You may experience some temporary fullness or mild hearing loss, but that should resolve within a few hours. I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for you with the audiologist next week. They will perform a comprehensive hearing test and balance assessment to help us determine the underlying cause of your dizziness. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild steroid ear drop to help reduce any inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. Steroid ear drops and a visit to the audiologist. And no more water in my ears, hopefully. I’m so glad we’re making progress. I just want to feel normal again, you know? And thank you for being so gentle and understanding. I was very anxious, and you made me feel much better. I appreciate it. Can I go home now? I’m a bit tired, and I just want to rest. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m glad I could help. And yes, absolutely, you can go home now. Rest is a good idea. Here’s a copy of your discharge instructions, which includes details about the ear drops and what to expect after the procedure. And here’s your prescription for the steroid ear drops. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. And remember, the audiologist will be able to provide a more thorough evaluation. Get some rest, Ms. Mayhugh. And I hope you feel better soon.
