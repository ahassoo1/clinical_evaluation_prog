DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, it’s my muscles. They feel… weak. It’s been happening for a couple of weeks now, and it’s getting a bit annoying, to be honest. I’m Edric, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “annoying” is a rather subjective assessment, Mr. McKinnon. We’ll get to the root of it. When you say weak, can you be more precise?
PATIENT: Precise… okay. It's not like I can’t move things, it’s just… harder. Like, carrying groceries feels a lot heavier than it used to. And even getting up from a chair takes more effort. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Not my face or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. And how long precisely has this “more effort” been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… around July 15th, I’d say. Maybe the 16th. I remember because I was helping my cousin move some furniture that day, and I noticed it then. It wasn’t awful, just a little bit more of a struggle than usual. It's definitely gotten worse since then, though.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No fever, no pain, really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess, but I always chalk that up to work. Oh! And my hands feel a bit… shaky sometimes, but only when I’m really concentrating on something. Like, if I’m trying to thread a needle. Does that count?
DOCTOR: “Shaky when concentrating.” Interesting. Now, before we proceed, have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or injuries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven't been sick in… well, I can't even remember the last time. No injuries either. I'm pretty careful, usually. I mean, I work with cars all day, so there's always the potential for a bump or scrape, but nothing major. Definitely haven’t been to the hospital.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My dad, he had… some problems with his joints when he got older, arthritis, I think. And my mom… she had high blood pressure. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. No one had anything with muscles, though, or anything like… what I'm describing. We don’t really talk about health much, if I’m being honest. It’s kind of a Yemeni thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your daily habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette. And I don't drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I try to eat okay, mostly rice and chicken, you know, typical food. I work long hours though, so sometimes I grab something quick and easy. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It’s all relevant, Mr. McKinnon. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never really been one for pills or anything. I figure if I’m feeling okay, there’s no need to mess with things. I haven’t even had a cold in years, so… yeah. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Please step onto the examination table. We’ll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'm not very good with doctor stuff, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: It will be straightforward. Please extend your arms, palms up. I will test your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Okay, here you go. That's… a little weird. Not painful, just… unexpected. I think both arms jumped? Is that normal? It felt like a little shock, honestly.
DOCTOR: The reflexes are… present, but slightly diminished. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Please try to resist as I apply pressure to your arms. Squeeze as hard as you can... and now resist as I push down.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m trying… it feels harder than it used to. I can do it, but it's definitely a struggle. And my right arm… feels a little weaker than my left, I think. Is that what you're looking for? This is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Your strength is… reduced in both upper extremities, with greater weakness noted on the right side. Now, let's examine your legs. Please lie back on the table, and I will check your reflexes and strength there as well.
PATIENT: Alright, here I am. Just let me know what to do. My legs… they feel okay, mostly. A bit tired, maybe, but… yeah. Go ahead. I hope this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are…normal, but resistance to movement is diminished in both legs. Based on my preliminary examination, your symptoms suggest a possible neuromuscular weakness. However, further investigation is required to determine the exact cause. I will need to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and creatine kinase levels, to assess your muscle function. Additionally, I recommend an electromyography to evaluate the electrical activity of your muscles.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… complicated. Blood work and… EMG? What does that even involve? And what does “neuromuscular weakness” mean exactly? Is it… serious? I just want to know if it’s something I need to worry about, and what I can do to feel better. I don’t want a bunch of tests if it’s just something minor. I have work, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, “neuromuscular weakness” indicates a problem with the nerves that control your muscles, or the muscles themselves. It could be minor, but it could also be indicative of a more serious underlying condition. The blood work will help us rule out several possibilities, such as electrolyte imbalances or muscle inflammation. The EMG involves inserting small needles into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It’s a bit uncomfortable, but necessary for accurate diagnosis. It’s irresponsible to dismiss potential concerns without proper investigation. I understand you have work, but your health is paramount. Here is a requisition for the blood work. You will need to schedule an appointment with the radiology department for the EMG. I will review the results once they are available and discuss the next steps with you. Do you have any further questions – and please attempt to be concise?
PATIENT: Concise… right. Okay. So… how long does all this take? The blood work, the EMG… and how much is it going to cost? I don't have insurance, so... that's kind of a big deal. And... is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, should I be resting? Or is there something I shouldn't be doing? I just… I need to know what I’m facing, and what it’s going to take to fix it. I really appreciate you trying to help, Doctor, but this is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, the timeline for results varies depending on the laboratory’s workload. The blood work typically takes 24-48 hours, and scheduling the EMG may take several days. As for the cost, I cannot provide an exact figure – you will need to contact the laboratory and radiology department directly. Unfortunately, without insurance, your expenses will be your responsibility. In the meantime, avoid strenuous activity and refrain from any exercises that exacerbate your weakness. Rest is advisable. However, complete inactivity is not recommended. Light, gentle movement is permissible, but avoid overexertion. I will provide you with a referral for a neurologist if further specialist evaluation is warranted. Now, I have other patients waiting. Do you have any essential questions remaining?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. So, blood work and try not to overdo it. And a neurologist if needed. I think… that’s all for now. I can handle it. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll call and try to schedule everything. I really hope it’s nothing too serious. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s hope for the best. .
