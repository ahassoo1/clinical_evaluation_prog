DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s my ears, I think. They just… aren’t what they used to be, you know? Things are a bit muffled. Hard to hear folks sometimes. Not sure exactly when it started, honestly. Just… gradually, I suppose. I worked in that shoe factory for a long time, maybe that had somethin' to do with it? Lots of noise.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you've been experiencing some gradual hearing loss, and you suspect it might be related to your work at the shoe factory. That's certainly a possibility – prolonged exposure to loud noises can definitely affect hearing. When you say "muffled," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's like… when someone talks, it’s not clear. Like they’re talkin’ through a pillow, maybe? Or underwater, a little bit. Not always, mind you. Sometimes I hear fine, especially if they speak up real loud. It's mostly the softer sounds I miss. And… oh dear, now I’m ramblin’. It's hard to explain, really. It just… isn’t as crisp as it used to be. Do you… understand what I mean? I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schneer, I understand perfectly. That’s a very good description – sounds being muffled or not as crisp. It sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty with the clarity and volume of softer sounds. That’s very common with noise-induced hearing loss, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if this affects one ear more than the other, or is it about the same in both?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… honestly don’t know. I don’t think so, but I haven’t really tried to listen to each ear separately, have I? They both seem pretty bad, I guess. It’s hard to tell. I mostly just turn up the TV, you know? My daughter, bless her heart, she’s always complainin’ about it being too loud. But… I can't really say if one's worse than the other. Sorry, I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. It’s not always easy to notice those subtle differences. We can certainly check that during the examination. Now, besides the muffled hearing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, sometimes my ears ring. Not all the time, just now and then. A sort of… high-pitched whine, I suppose. It doesn’t last long, usually. And… oh, and I get a little dizzy sometimes, but I fall a lot, so I figured that was just my age. I don’t know if that’s related or not. Everything just feels a bit… off, sometimes, but I’m 83, so who knows what’s normal anymore?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've experienced ringing in the ears – we call that tinnitus – and occasional dizziness. It's good you mentioned the dizziness. While it's true that dizziness can be common with age, it's important to investigate whether it could be related to your hearing, or something else. Do you feel like the dizziness happens at a specific time, or is it random?
PATIENT: Random, I think. It just… comes and goes. Usually when I stand up too fast, but sometimes for no reason at all. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. Enough to make me grab onto somethin', you know? It's more of a… wooziness, really. Not a proper spinny dizziness, if that makes sense. I haven’t paid it much mind, honestly. Old age, I figured. I’ve always been a bit clumsy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you've been aware of it, though. And it's wise to mention it, even if you think it's just age-related. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a tough one. Let me see… I’ve got a bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands and knees. Makes it hard to do things sometimes. And the doctor told me I had high blood pressure a while back, but I take a pill for that. Can’t remember the name of it, sorry. And… oh, I had my gallbladder taken out years ago. That's about all I can think of right now. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. I’m sure I’m forgettin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. You've mentioned some important things – arthritis, high blood pressure, and gallbladder removal. We can look up the details in your records as well. And you're taking medication for your blood pressure, that's good. Do you know the dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I just take the little white pill every morning. The doctor told me what to do, and my daughter makes sure I have enough. I don’t really pay attention to the numbers and things. I leave that to her, she’s much better with all that. I just know it keeps me from feelin’ too dizzy, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We can certainly look that up. It’s good you have your daughter helping you with that. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. I used to get a bit of a rash when I was a kid, but that was years ago. Nothing bothers me now, not really. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine, that I remember. I don’t take much, thankfully. Just the blood pressure pill and sometimes a little somethin' for my arthritis when it’s really bad. No, I don’t think so. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had hearing loss, or any other ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me see. My father, he was a bit hard of hearin' when he got older, I think. But he never went to the doctor, so I don’t really know what was wrong with him. My mother, she had good hearin' all her life. And my sister… well, I haven’t seen her in years. I don't really know about her health. I don't think so. Nobody that I know of, really. Just my father bein' a bit deaf when he got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were bad for you, and she was right about most things. My sister smoked, though. She smoked like a chimney, bless her heart. But me? Never. No, never smoked.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little now and then. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer with the news. Nothing fancy. I don’t drink much these days, really. It doesn’t agree with my stomach. Mostly just water, to be honest. Not a big drinker, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Schneer. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a closer look at your ears. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I’m a bit… sensitive, you know? Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’ll be gentle. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. Hmm… I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to your hearing difficulty. Your eardrums look intact, but a little dull. I don’t see any signs of infection or fluid.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is that bad? I always get wax, it just seems to build up. I try to clean it out sometimes, but I’m afraid of pushin’ it in further. Dull, you say? What does that mean? Is somethin’ wrong?
DOCTOR: A little wax buildup is very common, Mr. Schneer, and it's not necessarily bad. It's a natural protective mechanism for the ear. However, if it gets excessive, it can block the ear canal and affect your hearing. When I say "dull," I mean your eardrums aren’t as shiny and translucent as they should be. It can sometimes indicate a little bit of fluid behind the eardrum, or just age-related changes. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we should investigate further. I’d like to order a simple hearing test – an audiogram – to get a better understanding of the extent of your hearing loss and pinpoint which frequencies are affected. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Oh dear. I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… painful? Or uncomfortable? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, you know. Frequencies? What are those? I just know I can’t hear as well as I used to. Alright, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. But please be gentle.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be nervous, Mr. Schneer. A hearing test is completely painless and non-invasive. You won’t be poked or prodded at all. It involves wearing headphones and listening to different tones and sounds at various frequencies – different pitches, essentially. We’ll just ask you to indicate when you can hear the sounds. It’s a very simple procedure, and it will give us valuable information about your hearing loss. It will help us determine the best course of action. I’ll write you a referral to the audiology department at the clinic. They’ll schedule an appointment for you at your convenience. It usually takes about an hour. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An hour? Oh. Well, alright. If it’s just listenin’ to sounds, I suppose I can manage that. But I get tired easily, you know. And what if… what if it’s really bad? What if I can’t hear anything? Will I need… one of those hearin’ aids? I’ve seen people with those… they look a bit awkward, don’t they?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to be concerned, Mr. Schneer. Let's take things one step at a time. We don't know the extent of your hearing loss yet, and it's likely not as severe as you fear. The hearing test will give us a clear picture, and then we can discuss the best options. If you do have significant hearing loss, hearing aids are a very common and effective solution. They’ve come a long way in recent years – they’re much smaller, more discreet, and more comfortable than they used to be. Many people don't even notice them. They can significantly improve your quality of life, allowing you to hear conversations, enjoy music, and feel more connected to the world around you. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll wait for the results of the hearing test first. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. And if you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just… I’m a bit worried, I suppose. It’s just… gettin’ old, you know? Things just stop workin’ the way they used to. Alright. I’ll go get the test done. Thank you for your time, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It's perfectly normal to feel worried, and I understand your concerns. Getting older is a part of life, and it's important to take care of ourselves and address any health issues that arise. The audiology department will be in touch to schedule your appointment. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’ll see you back here after your hearing test to discuss the results. Have a good day, and please take care.
