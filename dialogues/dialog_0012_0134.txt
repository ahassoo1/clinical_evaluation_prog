DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, it’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it’s been a bit of a rough patch, honestly. I've been feeling sick to my stomach a lot, and I just don’t have much appetite anymore. Seems like I get full awful quick these days. It’s… worrying, you know? I don't rightly recall when it started, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling sick to your stomach and not having much appetite, and getting full quickly – those are definitely things worth looking into. And it's perfectly normal for things to feel a little fuzzy when you're not feeling well. Let me just pull up your record here… alright, Raymonde Kelder, born [redacted for privacy], Cherokee Nation. I see you’ve been coming to this clinic for a while. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the nausea?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Been coming here for… oh, goodness, a long time now. Doctor Miller used to see me, before… well, before he retired. The nausea… it comes and goes. It’s not constant, but it’s frequent. It’s mostly in the mornings, I think, but sometimes it flares up after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. And it’s not like a violent sickness, just… a queasy feeling. Like my stomach is… unsettled. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Raymonde. “Unsettled” is a good way to put it. And it’s not violent, just a queasy feeling, mostly in the mornings and sometimes after eating… even with different foods. No need to apologize, you're doing great. So, it sounds like it's been happening for a while now, and it's not consistently tied to any particular food. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed recently… let me think. Not that I recall. My daughter, Carol, she comes over most Sundays, that’s nice. And I still try to tend to my garden, though it’s harder now. My hands aren’t what they used to be. Oh! And the new neighbors moved in last month. Seem like nice folks, though I haven’t gotten to know them well. But nothing major has changed, no. I haven’t been traveling, haven't changed my diet… not intentionally, anyway. It just… started happening. It's just been a slow thing, creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major life changes, daughter visits, gardening, new neighbors… and it's been a gradual onset. That’s helpful to know. Now, besides the nausea and loss of appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Just feeling run down. And… oh, yes. My stomach feels… bloated sometimes. Even when I haven't eaten much. It’s uncomfortable. And… I’ve lost a little weight, Carol pointed it out. She worries about me, bless her heart. But I don’t feel… particularly weak, just tired. Is that making sense? Everything feels… muddled.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Raymonde. Tiredness, bloating, and some weight loss… It is good Carol is keeping an eye on you. Bloating even without eating much is worth noting, too. I see here you have a history of hypertension, managed with [redacted for privacy], and some osteoarthritis. Anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the high blood pressure. And the achy joints, keeps me slow, that does. Let me think… I had that gallbladder surgery, oh, must be fifteen, twenty years ago now. And… there was that bout of pneumonia a few years back. Bad cough, had to be on oxygen for a bit. But that cleared up. I… oh dear, I’m probably forgetting something important. It’s just… so hard to remember. I had some tests done a while back, Doctor Miller ordered them, but I don’t recall what they were for. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Raymonde. It's perfectly understandable to have trouble remembering things. Fifteen to twenty years ago gallbladder surgery, pneumonia a few years ago… I'm seeing those records here. Alright. And you're currently taking [redacted for privacy] for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. [redacted for privacy] every morning with my breakfast. Well, what’s left of my breakfast, anyway. I’ve been skipping it more and more lately, just haven’t been hungry. It’s… it's a bit of a worry. My mother always said a good breakfast sets you up for the day, but… it's hard to get motivated when your stomach feels so unsettled. And the medicine… sometimes it makes me feel a bit dizzy. Just a little, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, [redacted for privacy] daily, some dizziness as a side effect, and decreased appetite. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your tummy, feeling around gently, and checking your reflexes. It won't take long. Then, depending on what I find, we might want to run some blood tests to rule out anything serious. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright. If you think it's best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Been feeling off for too long now. A quick exam… yes, that’s fine. And blood tests if you need them. Do whatever you think is best. I’m just… tired of feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. Let’s start with the exam. If you could just lie down here on your back, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Okay. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Just let me know if anything feels painful. I'll start on your right side here…
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. And… yes, please be gentle with my joints, they ache a bit. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay. There’s a little bit of tenderness when I press here, on your left side, but nothing too concerning. No obvious masses that I can feel. Your reflexes are normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/85, but that’s not unusual given your history. Overall, the exam isn't revealing anything dramatic, but the tenderness on your left side, combined with your symptoms, suggests we should run some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work… alright. The tenderness on my left side… I hadn’t really noticed it before, just assumed it was my joints acting up. If you think it’s best to run some tests, then please do. I just want to get to the bottom of this. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. I'm going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a C-reactive protein test. These will help us rule out infection, check your kidney and liver function, and see if your thyroid is playing a role. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels – low vitamin D can sometimes cause fatigue and digestive issues. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw some blood. It shouldn’t take too long. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if your nausea gets worse or you develop any new symptoms like fever, severe abdominal pain, or difficulty breathing, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… thorough. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… all of it, really. It’s just… a lot to take in. But I appreciate you running the tests. And thank you for listening to me. No fever… I’ll remember that. And I will call if anything gets worse. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. It’s my job. And don't hesitate to call, even if it's just to ask a question. We'll get to the bottom of this together. The lab technician should be here soon. I'll leave you to get ready. If you need anything at all, just let the nurse know. Alright, I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Have a good day, Raymonde.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
