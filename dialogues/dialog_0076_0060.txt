DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, good to meet you. Twenty-four, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Twenty-four. Look, I don’t really do small talk, if that’s okay. I scheduled this appointment because… well, my family has a history, and I want to make sure I’m not headed down the same path. It’s mostly on my mother’s side, but it’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Concerning. Right. Everyone says concerning. Let's cut to the chase then. What specifically is concerning?
PATIENT: Honestly? A lot of heart problems. My grandfather died young, a heart attack. And my aunt… she’s had stents put in twice now. My mother has high blood pressure, always on medication. It feels like everyone's constantly at the cardiologist. I feel…pre-disposed, I guess. I just want to know if I'm doomed, basically. I eat alright, I think. I try to. But you know, genetics, right? It’s…powerful.
DOCTOR: Powerful is…a bit dramatic. But alright. “Eat alright.” That’s not a diagnosis. And family history is a factor, certainly. So, let's quantify this “alright.” What does a typical day of eating look like for you, Mr. Theriot?
PATIENT: Look, I didn’t come here for a lecture on my diet. I just want some tests, you know? Reassurance. But fine. A typical day… I usually skip breakfast. Not a morning person. Lunch is usually something quick – a sandwich, maybe takeout. And dinner… depends. Sometimes I cook, usually pasta. Or I’ll order something. I’m not unhealthy, I just… don't prioritize it. It’s not like I'm eating burgers and fries every day. Mostly just…convenient. And I drink coffee. A lot of coffee. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don’t see how what I eat has anything to do with what happened to them.
DOCTOR: Everything is connected, Mr. Theriot. Everything. The coffee...yes, that's relevant. And "not prioritizing" is often code for "not very good." Alright. Let's move on. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. I find it disgusting. And frankly, unhealthy. Really, I don't understand why anyone would. I’m not trying to give myself heart problems, you know? I came here because I'm worried about getting them, not actively seeking them out. Do you always interrogate your patients like this? It feels…condescending.
DOCTOR: It’s called gathering information, Mr. Theriot. And believe me, I’ve seen plenty of patients who seem perfectly healthy on the surface. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Socially. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a beer watching a game. Nothing excessive. I don’t… I don’t drink to cope or anything. It’s not a habit, it’s just… relaxing. I’m a functional adult, doctor. I don’t have problems with things. Are we getting anywhere with this or are you just trying to find flaws in my lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Right, “functional.” Okay. Let's try this a different way. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: No. No chest pain. No shortness of breath. No palpitations. No dizziness. No swelling. Look, I told you, I feel fine. I’m here because I’m worried about what could happen, not because anything is happening. Honestly, it's frustrating that you seem to think I’m making this up or something. I'm perfectly healthy, and I’m wasting my time here being questioned about my coffee intake.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, perfectly healthy people usually don’t come to cardiologists, Mr. Theriot. Let's do a quick exam, just to…confirm this “perfect health.” Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Routine. Don't make a production of it. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect a miracle. I'm telling you, you're going to find nothing wrong. It's all just anxiety, I swear. My mother always said I worried too much. It's probably just inherited that, too. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to need some blood work. Cholesterol, triglycerides, basic metabolic panel. Standard stuff. And an EKG, just to get a baseline. Nurse will get you set up. Don't get worked up about it. It’s preventative.
PATIENT: Preventative? It’s just what I want. More tests to confirm what I already know: I'm probably fine and you're wasting my time. Fine. Whatever. Just…how long is this going to take? I have things to do, you know? It’s not like I can just sit here all day getting poked and prodded because my mother had high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the timeline. Shouldn't be terribly long. And frankly, Mr. Theriot, if you're so convinced everything is fine, there's very little I can do for you. Consider this…peace of mind. Or confirmation of your perfectly healthy status. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients who are actually experiencing symptoms. The nurse will call you when she’s ready.
PATIENT: Symptoms? I have symptoms. It's called anxiety, and it's probably a family trait, too. Honestly.
