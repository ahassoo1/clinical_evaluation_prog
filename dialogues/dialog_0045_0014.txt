DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to see you too. Hmm... what brings me in... well, it's about some papers, I think. My wife, she says I need something from you. Something for… time off? Or maybe help with things… I can’t quite put my finger on it. It has to do with work, I believe. Something official.
DOCTOR: Papers, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, papers. She’s very organized, my wife. I'm… not so much. It’s about being away from work for a bit, I think? Or maybe not being able to do everything I usually do? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. She said something about FMLA or… disability? Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: FMLA… disability… Right. Well, let's try to untangle this. So, are you currently unable to work, or are you anticipating needing time off in the future?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I am still working, yes. But… things are harder now. I get tired more easily. And… focusing is difficult sometimes. It's not that I can't work, exactly, but it takes me much longer to get things done. And I worry about making mistakes. Maybe I will need time off soon if things don't improve? I honestly don't know. My wife thinks it's best to get the paperwork sorted just in case.
DOCTOR: So, you're feeling a bit run down, a little slower. Happens when you get older, Mr. Limtiaco. A lot of patients come in with similar complaints. Let’s go through some questions, just to get a better picture. Have you noticed any specific changes lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, well, I am getting on, aren't I? Sixty-seven years… it adds up! Specific changes… hmm. Let me think. My memory is… not what it used to be, certainly. And like I said, getting tired is a big one. Even things I used to enjoy, like gardening, leave me exhausted. And I sometimes feel… a bit lost in my thoughts, if that makes sense? Not confused, exactly, just… distant. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Distant… right. And this has been happening for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It feels like it’s been creeping up on me for… well, at least six months, I suppose. Maybe longer? It's hard to pinpoint. It wasn't sudden, you see. Just… a gradual slowing down. My wife noticed it first, to be honest. She has a very good memory, unlike me! She kept saying I was more forgetful, and less… energetic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this affecting your daily life significantly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I think it is. It’s little things, mostly. Forgetting appointments, misplacing things… things I used to handle without a second thought. I used to be very involved in the church, helping with the religious education programs, but I’ve had to pull back a bit. I just can’t seem to keep track of everything like I used to. And… I worry about driving, to be honest. Just little things, but they add up, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I sleep alright, I suppose. Though I wake up a few times during the night. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Not enough to fall, but just a bit wobbly. And occasionally, a bit of a headache, but nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what's normal at my age and what isn't!
DOCTOR: Well, "normal" is a broad term. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard stuff. Then we can talk about potential causes. Have you had any recent changes to your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds good. A check-up is always a good idea. Medications… let me see. No, no changes recently. I've been on the same things for years, for my blood pressure and… something for cholesterol, I think. My wife manages all of that, she’s much better with remembering those details than I am. She’ll have the list if you need it.
DOCTOR: We can check the records. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, stand up slowly. Any dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. Just… a little wobbly, maybe. But that’s normal for me, I think. I’ve always been a bit unsteady on my feet. It’s probably just my age. My wife says I need to do more exercise… but I get so tired!
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can. Like this? Is that alright? My eyesight isn't what it used to be, either. I need reading glasses for most things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Okay. And finally, I want to check your reflexes. Both reflexes are present, but a little diminished. Seems like things are slowing down, as you said.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? Just… slowing down. That’s what happens when you get old, I suppose. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? Will I need those papers for work, do you think? The FMLA or… whatever it was?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Limtiaco, it could be a number of things. It’s likely age-related decline, but we can’t rule out other possibilities without further testing. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, memory issues, and difficulty focusing – I recommend a few blood tests to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. We should also consider a cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. As for the paperwork… it's probably best to wait until we have the test results before making any decisions about FMLA or disability. We need a clear picture of what we’re dealing with before we go down that road. I’ll order those tests now.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Tests… well, that sounds sensible, I suppose. My wife will be pleased you're being thorough. So, just blood tests and… a thinking test? I’m not very good at tests, you know. I always get flustered. Is it a difficult one? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to worry my wife unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: It’s not a difficult test, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s just a series of simple questions to assess your cognitive function. It’s not pass or fail, it’s just a baseline. As for the blood tests, they usually take a couple of days to come back. The cognitive assessment will take a bit longer, maybe a week or so. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And honestly, try to focus on things you can do, instead of dwelling on what you can’t. Now, let’s get these orders entered.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Rest… I’ll try. It's just hard when I get so tired all the time. Very well. If you think that’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Thank you for seeing me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll let my wife know you’ve ordered the tests. And I'll try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions. Have a good day, Mr. Limtiaco.
