DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, my daughter, she said I really ought to know my blood type. Something about... just in case. Honestly, I can't rightly remember why exactly, but she was quite insistent. It’s probably important. Do you think so?
DOCTOR: Well, your daughter is… prudent, I suppose. Knowing your blood type isn't routinely necessary, but it can be useful information, particularly as you get older. It's good to have it on file, just in case of an emergency. We can certainly get that done today. Aside from that, are you experiencing any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Oh, emergencies… yes. Well, not really anything wrong, no. Just… old, I suppose. A little creaky in the mornings, but nothing a good cup of coffee doesn't fix. My knees bother me sometimes, but that's been happening for years. No, no real worries, Doctor. It’s just this blood type thing. My daughter, bless her heart, she worries so.
DOCTOR: “Creaky in the mornings,” I see. And the knee discomfort… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, definitely comes and goes. Worse when it’s damp, you know? Like this weather we’ve been having. It doesn’t keep me from doing things, not really. I still potter about in the garden, and I used to… well, I was a rigger, you see. A long time ago now, of course. Not much rigging these days. It just aches a bit sometimes, that’s all. Do you… need to know about the rigging? It probably doesn’t matter.
DOCTOR: A rigger, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A long time ago, now. On the ships, mostly. Before things became so… automatic, you know? Lots of ropes and pulleys. It was good work, strong work. My husband, he was one too. Met him on a ship, actually. Though he wasn't a very good one... always dropping things. He was better at the paperwork, thankfully. But… oh dear, I’m rambling now, aren't I? What were we talking about? My knees, wasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, your knees. And your past work. It's helpful to know your activity level, even if it’s changed. So, you’re still active in the garden, despite the discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the garden. It keeps me busy. Roses, mostly. And tomatoes, of course. Can't have a garden without tomatoes. Not as much as I used to, mind you. The bending and stooping… that's the hard part. I try to take it easy, but… well, I like being out there. It's good for the soul, you know? Though I have to ask my daughter to do the heavy lifting these days. She doesn't mind, bless her. Do you… do you need to know what kind of roses I grow? I have a particularly nice Peace rose…
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Nini, the specific roses aren’t relevant at this time. Let's try to focus. You mentioned bending and stooping is difficult. Is that causing any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, radiating… now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes. Not all the time, and not bad pain, just a sort of… ache. Down the back of my legs, mostly. It comes and goes, like everything else. I thought it was just old age, honestly. You know, things creaking and groaning. Is that… is that bad? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. And this ache… does it feel like it’s a muscle pain, or more like a sharp, shooting pain?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a good question. I’m not very good at describing these things. It's not really sharp, not like when I broke my wrist, years ago. It’s more of a… dull ache. And it comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes it feels like it’s in my hips too. Hard to say, really. Everything feels a bit… connected, doesn’t it? Like one big ache. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Nini, with age, things do tend to feel more… interconnected. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just a basic assessment of your hips, knees, and back, to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I suppose poking and prodding is the only way to find out what's going on with all these aches, isn't it? Though I must warn you, I bruise very easily. My daughter says it’s because my blood is too thin. Perhaps that's why she wants to know my blood type! Do you think that's it?
DOCTOR: We’ll be gentle, Mrs. Nini. And we’ll determine if your bruising is related to any medical condition or medication. Please, if you'll just step up on the table here… First, let's check your reflexes. Could you extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Here we go… My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. Now, which leg first? It’s probably best to start with the left one, isn't it? Or does it not matter? I always get these things mixed up. Be careful, now. Don't want to fall and break anything!
DOCTOR: Alright. Both reflexes are present, though slightly diminished, which is common with age. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’m going to palpate your hips and knees… just feel around to assess for tenderness and range of motion. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Is there any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that's a bit tender. Right there. Not sharp, like I said, just a dull ache. A bit like when it’s damp, you know? Like my knees. Everything feels connected, doesn’t it? Are you sure it’s alright to poke around so much? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor. It’s probably just old age, honestly. I always thought it was just old age.
DOCTOR: A bit of crepitus noted on hip range of motion. And some tenderness to palpation in the left hip, as you indicated. Your knees also demonstrate mild crepitus with flexion and extension. I'm also noting some mild swelling in both knees. Do you notice this swelling yourself, particularly after activity?
PATIENT: Oh, swelling… now that you mention it, yes. I hadn’t really paid attention to it, but they do feel a bit… puffy sometimes. After I've been gardening, mostly. Or if I’ve been on my feet all day. It doesn’t hurt, not really, just… bigger. My daughter always tells me to put my feet up, but I don’t like sitting still. It feels like a waste of time, you know? Is swelling bad, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Based on my examination and your history, it sounds like you’re experiencing osteoarthritis, likely in both your hips and knees. The crepitus, tenderness, swelling, and diminished range of motion are all consistent with this diagnosis. It’s a common condition, particularly with age and activity level. It’s not necessarily serious in the sense of being immediately life-threatening, but it can certainly impact your quality of life. We can discuss management options to help alleviate your pain and improve your mobility. However, before we do that, I’d like to order some blood work, including a Complete Blood Count and inflammatory markers, to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. And, as you requested, we’ll also determine your blood type. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis. That sounds… complicated. I just thought it was old age! Complicated sounds expensive. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, I suppose blood work is alright. And the blood type, of course. My daughter will be pleased. So, you poke and prod, and then take some blood? Is it much blood? I don’t like needles, you know. And will it take long? I have to get home and water the roses…
DOCTOR: It’s a relatively simple blood draw, Mrs. Nini, just a few vials. It shouldn't take long at all, perhaps ten to fifteen minutes. We'll send the samples to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, we can discuss some initial management strategies, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, gentle exercise, and weight management, if applicable. Would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results and discuss these options in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Ten minutes, you say? That doesn't sound too bad. And discussing options… that’s good. I don’t want to take a lot of pills, you know. I prefer to stay active, if possible. A follow-up appointment… yes, that would be good. Just… not too soon, please. I have to get back to my garden. And… do you think I should water the roses before or after the blood draw? I wouldn’t want to faint!
DOCTOR: Water the roses after the blood draw, Mrs. Nini. Definitely after. Let’s get the blood work done first, and then you can return to your gardening. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the samples now. She'll explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… the blood draw. And then the roses. Thank you for not laughing at me, and for listening. My daughter says I talk too much. I do get a bit muddled sometimes, you know. Just the blood draw, then. And please tell the nurse I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Nini. We'll take good care of you. I'll inform the nurse.
