DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Or… is it Norval?
PATIENT: Norval’s fine, son. Just Norval. Good morning to you too. It’s a bit warm for August, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is. Though, truthfully, the days all seem to blend together these days. Now, you’re here today… what brought you in?
PATIENT: Well, it's this… feeling full really quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I’m eating, really. A few bites and I just… stop being hungry. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s just… strange. I used to have a good appetite, you know? Especially for salmon.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling full quickly… a month or so. And it's not tied to any specific food?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Toast, soup, fish… even just a little bit of bannock. It all seems the same. It’s not like I’m sick after I eat, just… not hungry anymore. It’s making it hard to keep my strength up, you know? My wife worries about it.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Losing your appetite can definitely affect your strength. And it’s good your wife is keeping an eye on things. Hmm… have you noticed any pain when you eat, or even before you eat?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Not at all. Just… full. Like someone put a stopper in me. It's hard to explain. And it's not like I'm forcing myself to eat, I just… lose the wanting to, after a few bites. Makes for a lot of wasted food, which my grandma would not approve of. She lived through hard times, you know. Wasted nothing.
DOCTOR: I see. No pain, just a quick loss of appetite. And you’ve noticed this regardless of what you're eating... Alright. Now, have you experienced any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But at my age, aren’t you always tired? My memory ain’t what it used to be, either, but that’s just getting old. Oh! And I’ve been… well, a little bit looser in the bowels, if you don’t mind me saying. Not bad, just… not as firm as they used to be. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes. Fatigue, memory changes, and a change in bowel habits… all potentially relevant. We need to consider everything. Now, just to clarify the bowel changes, are we talking about more frequent movements, or just a difference in consistency?
PATIENT: Just consistency, I think. Not going more often, just… softer. Like… well, like watered-down coffee, if you’ll pardon the comparison. It’s not causing any trouble, thankfully. Just… different. It started around the same time as the feeling full, I reckon. It's all a bit of a mess, really. I’m not used to things being… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, memory changes, change in bowel consistency, and early satiety – feeling full quickly. Hmm. Now, have you had any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… That’s a good question. My wife does most of the weighing. I haven’t been keeping track myself. I think I might have lost a pound or two, but it could just be the summer heat. I haven’t been eating as much, so… I honestly couldn’t say for sure. She’ll know. She keeps a good record of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll definitely want to check that. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. The doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but it came down with diet and exercise. I walk every day, weather permitting, you know. Used to fish a lot more, but it’s getting harder to get out there. Other than that… no, nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. My mother always said good genes were the key.
DOCTOR: Alright, good genes are a good thing. And regular walking is excellent. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And I had a cataract removed from one eye a few years back. That was a pretty quick procedure, thankfully. Other than that, no. Nothing else. I always tried to avoid hospitals if I could. Not a fan of the smell, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, the doctor said to keep my heart happy. And sometimes I take a little something for my joints if they’re acting up, but that’s just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing regular, really. Mostly just the aspirin. And a lot of tea. Does tea count as medication?
DOCTOR: Tea doesn't count, Mr. Obarr. Just the aspirin, then, and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. My wife always checks when she gets me new pills, just to be safe. She’s a good woman, that one. Always looking out for me. No, no allergies. I can eat shellfish, thankfully. Wouldn’t be much point in living in Haida Gwaii if you couldn’t eat salmon, would it?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few basic things. It won't take long.
PATIENT: That sounds fine, son. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? My ribs are a bit tender these days. And if you hear anything funny, you know I’m a bit of a storyteller, so don’t believe everything I tell you.
DOCTOR: I'll be gentle, Mr. Obarr, and I promise not to believe everything. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Another one… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but slightly diminished breath sounds in the bases. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Is there any pain here?
PATIENT: No pain there. Just… feels a bit soft, I suppose. Like a water balloon. Not that I’ve been filling balloons lately, mind you. Haven't had a party in years. It’s comfortable enough, I guess. Just… not as firm as it used to be. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Obarr, but it’s something we need to investigate. I’m feeling some slight tenderness in the lower abdomen, on the left side. Not sharp pain, just… sensitivity. Now, I'm just going to check your lymph nodes. This is to feel for any swelling. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Alright, that's the basic exam. I'd like to order a few blood tests, just to get a better picture of what's going on. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other things. I also think it would be helpful to get a stool sample, to check for any hidden bleeding or infection.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Stool sample, eh? Well, I suppose that’s part of being a patient. Blood tests and… everything. My wife will be happy I'm taking care of things. She's always on me to get checked out. Okay, son. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know when and where to… contribute. And I’ll try not to think about it too much. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: I’ll have the nurse give you the instructions for the stool sample collection – it's a fairly simple process. As for the blood tests, we can do those right here in the clinic. It will just take a few minutes. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like a mild digestive issue or a change in diet. But it could also be something more serious, such as early signs of colon cancer. While I don’t want to jump to conclusions, it’s important to rule out any potential concerns. That’s why I’m ordering these tests. I’ll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… Well, that’s not what I wanted to hear. But I suppose it’s better to know, right? My mother always said facing things head-on was the only way. A week… yes, that’s fine. I’ll make sure my wife is available. She’s good at asking questions, you know. Always remembers everything I forget. Alright, son. Let’s get these tests done. Whatever it is, let’s find out and get it taken care of. I'm a bit worried, but I trust your judgement. Just let me know what I need to do, and I’ll do it. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s the spirit, Mr. Obarr. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood samples now. She'll also give you the instructions for the stool sample, and a requisition form for the lab. I’ll also have her schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as significant abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Obarr. And remember, worrying won't help. Let's just focus on getting the information we need.
PATIENT: .
