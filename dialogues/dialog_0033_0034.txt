DOCTOR: Right. Emileigh Bonck, age 21. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. Well, I just moved here… and I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I guess? It's for, you know, Medicare stuff. I'm married. I don't really… remember what they told me to do after moving. Everything's kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: Blurry, yes. Well, establishing care is… standard. And Medicare requires certain things, naturally. Let's try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific… okay. Um… I think it’s just a check-up? Like, to make sure everything's okay? I work with… machines. Mechanical stuff. I don't really get sick much, but… you gotta, right? For the insurance? I don’t really know what all they need.
DOCTOR: Right. A general check-up. Fine. We’ll do a basic physical, and I'll need a fairly detailed history. Before we get to that, are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Not really? Maybe… I get tired easier than I used to? But I work long hours, so… it could just be that. My husband says I sometimes… space out. But he says that a lot. Does that count as a symptom? I don’t know. Everything feels normal, mostly.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and… spacing out. Right. Vague complaints. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… um… I think I had strep throat when I was little? A really bad one. But that was ages ago. And… I think my mom said I had asthma, but I haven’t used an inhaler in forever. I don’t really remember a lot about it. It’s all kinda… fuzzy. Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy is… unhelpful. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don't think so? I mean, nothing big. Maybe I had my tonsils out? But I really don't remember. My husband would probably know, but he's at work right now. I just moved here, so I haven't had time to… see anyone about anything yet. Does that make sense? It's all new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history then. Any significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma on my mom's side had… something with her heart? I think. And my grandpa, on my dad's side, had diabetes. But… they were both pretty old when it happened. I don’t know if that matters? I don’t know a lot about my family history, to be honest. We didn't talk about it much. I'm sorry. Is this going to take long? I feel a little… lost.
DOCTOR: Lost is… a common feeling, apparently. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. I don’t like the smell. My husband doesn’t either. We both, uh… drink sometimes. Like, a glass of wine with dinner. Nothing crazy. We don’t really go out much. Mostly just work and… watch TV. And I do a lot of fixing things. Machines, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. I don't think so? I haven't really taken much medicine. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a kid, I think? But that was a long time ago. I remember being really itchy. But other than that… no? I’m pretty sure. It’s just… hard to remember, you know? Everything feels like a dream sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Penicillin allergy noted. Let’s move on. Weight and height, according to the intake form, are… concerning. 82 kilograms and 1.5 meters. Are these accurate?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yeah, I guess so? I’ve… put on some weight since I moved. It's hard to eat healthy when you're working long hours, you know? And… I don't really exercise much. It's just… been a stressful few months. Is that… bad? I didn’t realize it was that much.
DOCTOR: It is… suboptimal. Alright. I’m going to perform a basic physical exam now. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. It’s standard procedure, and will help me get a better overview of your condition.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, yeah. Blood pressure and heart rate. Right. Is… is it going to hurt? I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles yet. Just the cuff and the stethoscope. Please lie down. Blood pressure is elevated: 140/90. Heart rate is 88 and regular. Respiration is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no guarding or rebound tenderness. I will now check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay… reflexes. That sounds… scary. Is everything okay? Is my blood pressure really bad? My husband always worries about my health. He says I work too hard.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Within normal limits. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not immediately alarming. It requires monitoring. Given your weight, blood pressure and self-reported fatigue, and the vague nature of your symptoms… I recommend a basic blood workup. A complete metabolic panel, lipid profile, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We also need a urinalysis. This will help rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a… what did you call it? Urine thing? That sounds… complicated. And scary. Is something really wrong? I just moved here, and I don't even have a regular doctor yet. My husband is going to be so worried. Can't we just… do something easier? Like, maybe just tell me to get more sleep? Or eat better? I don't like hospitals. Or needles. Or… all of this.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Bonck. I understand your apprehension. But “getting more sleep” isn’t a diagnostic tool. We need objective data to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure there isn't something more serious going on. The blood work and urinalysis are standard procedures. It's responsible care. I can write you a referral to a therapist if you're experiencing significant anxiety related to medical procedures. But the blood work is necessary. I will also prescribe a multivitamin. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A therapist… I don't… I don't think so. I just… I wish it didn't have to be so complicated. Okay, the blood work. And the… urine thing. Where do I go for that? And… will it hurt? I'm really, really scared of needles. Is there… is there any way to make it less scary?
DOCTOR: Here. This form lists the tests and the address of the lab. They are located on Elm Street, just a few blocks from here. As for the needle… it will be a quick prick. Try to breathe deeply and focus on something else. The phlebotomist will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. It is a minor inconvenience, Ms. Bonck. And frankly, avoiding necessary medical evaluation is far more concerning than a simple blood draw. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Elm Street… okay. A quick prick… I guess. No… I don’t think so. Thank you… I think. I just… I really hope everything is okay. And… I hope I can get through this.
