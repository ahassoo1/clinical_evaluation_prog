DOCTOR: Hello Reneisha, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. It's not like I've changed anything in my routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight gain can definitely be unsettling when it seems to come out of nowhere. Let's try to get to the bottom of it. Now, you mentioned no changes to your routine… could you tell me a little more about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an orderly at the hospital – mostly cleaning and assisting the nurses. It's… physical work, I suppose, though not strenuous constantly. I’m on my feet a good deal, perhaps six or seven hours a day. Then, I go home to my husband, and I prepare dinner. We usually eat around six, and then we watch television. I don't do much beyond that, really. I’m not one for… hobbies, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds like a fairly active day, even if it isn't constantly strenuous. And about six or seven hours on your feet is good. Hmm… Now, thinking about your diet, could you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you and your husband?
PATIENT: Well, my husband, Darius, he… enjoys his food. We typically have a fairly large breakfast – eggs, bacon, toast, sometimes sausages. Lunch is usually leftovers from dinner, or sandwiches. Dinner… we eat a lot of potatoes. Mashed, roasted, sometimes fried. And meat, usually pork or chicken. I try to include vegetables, but Darius isn’t terribly fond of them, so it's often just a small portion. I bake bread, sometimes cakes, for dessert. It’s… traditional Lithuanian cooking, mostly. I suppose it's not the healthiest.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. That gives me a little better picture. It sounds like a hearty diet, as you said. And a good amount of carbohydrates and fats. Do you generally drink a lot of sugary drinks – sodas, juices, things like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I prefer water, mostly. Darius has a soda with dinner sometimes, but I rarely drink them. Perhaps a glass of juice with breakfast on a weekend, but that’s about it. We do have tea, of course. Black tea, with a little milk. Nothing sweet, really. I am not a fan of sugary drinks, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. I have been… more tired, perhaps? Not constantly exhausted, but I feel sluggish more often than I used to. And I get… warmer, easily. Like, I used to be able to tolerate warmer weather, but this summer I've been quite uncomfortable, even indoors. I also seem to be… thirstier than usual, but I attributed that to the heat. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. Okay, increased fatigue, feeling warmer, and increased thirst… those are all things we need to consider. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. But, yes, actually. I’ve been… constipated, for a few weeks now. It’s not severe, but it’s noticeable. I’ve tried drinking more water, but it hasn’t helped much. It’s… unpleasant. I apologize for being so blunt.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Reneisha, that's important information. We need to know everything to get a clear picture. Alright, constipation, along with the fatigue, thirst and warmth… And you said this weight gain has been happening for a few weeks now?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately six weeks, I believe. It started gradually, and I initially dismissed it as… normal fluctuations. But it continued, and then I started noticing the other symptoms. It’s been… worrying me increasingly. My mother always said weight gain could be a sign of… well, never mind. It’s probably nothing. But I wanted to get it checked, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six weeks, gradual onset... Your mother's intuition is often valuable, so I'm glad you came in. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. I’ve never had any reaction to anything. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches. Nothing else. I have a fairly strong constitution, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies, no regular medications. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman, perhaps twenty years ago. And I broke my arm once, skiing. But nothing serious, really. No chronic illnesses, no heart problems, no diabetes. I have been, generally, quite healthy. My husband, Darius, he had his gallbladder removed a few years ago, but that’s about it. He has high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal, broken arm in the past, and Darius has managed hypertension. And just to be complete, is there a family history of any major medical conditions - like diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. And my father’s brother, he had heart problems, a stroke, I think. But that’s about it, as far as I know. My mother was very healthy, thankfully, lived to be eighty-five. I don't believe there's a history of thyroid problems on either side of the family. It’s… a fairly long-lived family, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes and heart disease. Alright, Reneisha, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and examine your thyroid. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Reneisha, just take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 145 over 90. A little elevated. Pulse is 88, regular rhythm. Hmm… thyroid feels slightly enlarged and a bit firm. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Alright. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. It will help us determine the cause of your weight gain, fatigue, and other symptoms. Do you have any concerns about getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: Blood tests… no, I don’t have a particular fear of them, but I don't enjoy them. The needles, mostly. But if it's necessary, then, of course, I will have them done. I just… dislike the feeling. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I fast beforehand? I would like to be properly prepared.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. A little discomfort for a good cause, right?
PATIENT: Exactly. That is my thinking, Doctor. And yes, please. I prefer to be prepared. Should I avoid eating or drinking anything before the tests? And will I need to make an appointment specifically for the blood work, or can I do it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the most accurate results, please fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water is okay. And you can get the blood work done here at the clinic. I'll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab just down the hall. They take walk-ins, but it might be best to go first thing in the morning to avoid a long wait. Here you are. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Eight to twelve hours… I can certainly manage that. Thank you for writing the form. And thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness. I will go to the lab first thing tomorrow morning. I believe that is everything, then? If not, please do not hesitate to ask. I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. You've been very helpful as well, providing a lot of important information. And yes, I think that’s everything for today. Just to recap, we're looking into the cause of your weight gain, fatigue, increased thirst, and constipation. We’ve ordered blood tests to check your thyroid function, blood sugar, and overall health. We'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. If you experience any sudden or severe symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or significant changes in your vision – please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. You have answered all of my questions, and you have been very clear and compassionate. I am grateful for your patience and understanding. I will follow your instructions regarding the fasting and the blood tests. I anticipate hearing from you soon. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. Have a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. You take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well. .
