DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome! I’m Dr. Decosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They… bother me. A lot of pressure, mostly. I do not… remember how long. It feels like a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. That’s no fun at all. "Feels like a while" is helpful, but could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. That is… hard. Maybe… two months? Three? I work… a lot. The noise… it is very loud. I forget things sometimes. It started… before the really hot weather, I think. Before July, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a couple of months, starting before July. And the noise at work… is that a constant thing, or does it seem to make the sinus pressure worse?
PATIENT: Constant, yes. Very constant. The drill… it is very loud all day. And… I think it makes it worse, maybe. When I stop working for the night, it feels… better. A little. But not much. It is always… something. Even when I rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant loud noise at work seems to be a factor. Besides the pressure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… my head hurts. A dull ache, mostly. And… I feel tired. Very tired, even when I sleep. I do not have… a fever, I don’t think. My husband checks sometimes. He says no. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important things to know. So, headache, fatigue, no fever reported by your husband… good to know. Is the headache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly… it is when the pressure is bad. If the sinuses feel… full, the headache is there too. Not all the time. Sometimes… just the pressure. It is… confusing. I do not remember it being so… complicated before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the headache tends to come with the sinus pressure. That makes sense. And you said the pressure doesn't completely go away, even with rest?
PATIENT: Yes. Even when I am not at work… it is still there. Not as bad, maybe. But always… a little something. It is… uncomfortable. It makes it hard to… concentrate. And I worry. I worry it will get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Let's do a quick exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… very good. I… I appreciate that. Anything to… figure it out. Please.
DOCTOR: Great. I'm going to start by listening to your lungs and checking your ears, and then I’ll take a look at your sinuses. It might be a little uncomfortable when I press on your face, but let me know if anything is too painful. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Okay, lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your ears… Alright, ears look normal as well. Now, I'm going to gently press on your sinuses to see if we can pinpoint any tenderness. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That one… it hurts a little. Not… terrible. But definitely… something. The other side… not so much. Just that one. It feels… tight. And… a little warm, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so tenderness on your left cheek, and you feel some warmth there as well. That's helpful to know. Given your history of constant exposure to loud noise at work, along with the sinus pressure, headache, and tenderness on your left cheek, it sounds like you might be experiencing a sinus infection – possibly sinusitis, complicated by some tension from the stress and noise. However, it's difficult to say for sure without further testing. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a CT scan of your sinuses. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… CT scan? Is that… necessary? Is it expensive? I do not… have insurance, Doctor. I worry about the cost. And… is it safe?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, and I completely understand your hesitation, especially without insurance. A CT scan uses X-rays, so there is a small amount of radiation exposure, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of getting an accurate diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. As for the cost, I understand that's a major concern. The clinic does offer a discount program for uninsured patients, and we can also discuss payment options. We can also explore other options, such as starting a course of antibiotics and seeing if your symptoms improve, but that wouldn't give us as clear of a picture of what's going on. The CT scan will help me determine if there's an infection, inflammation, or any other structural issues causing your symptoms. Would you like me to explain the scan process in more detail?
PATIENT: …Explain the process, please. And… tell me more about the discount program. I… I do not want to ignore it. But the cost… it worries me a lot. If the antibiotics might work… maybe we could try that first? I do not… like X-rays.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Let’s talk about the CT scan and the antibiotics. The CT scan itself is pretty quick. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It takes just a few minutes, and you won't feel anything. We'll need to make sure you aren’t pregnant before we proceed, just as a standard safety precaution. As for the antibiotics, we could try that route first. We'd likely start with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and see if your symptoms improve within a week or so. However, if the antibiotics don’t work, or if your symptoms worsen, we'd still need to get that CT scan to figure out what's going on. There's a chance it could be something more serious than a simple sinus infection, and we want to rule that out. Regarding the discount program, our billing department offers a sliding scale discount based on income. I can have them contact you directly to discuss your options. They can also give you a better estimate of the cost. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: …Antibiotics first, please. Just… try that. If it does not work… then I will do the scan. But… please. Let's try the medicine first. And… yes, please have the billing department contact me. I… I need to know the cost. Beforehand. I… I worry about debt. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable plan. We’ll start with a course of antibiotics – I’m going to prescribe Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for 7 days. Make sure to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s done. And I'll have the billing department reach out to you today to discuss the cost and payment options. Here’s the prescription and some information about the medication. It’s important to stay well-hydrated while you're taking the antibiotics, and if you experience any side effects like rash, difficulty breathing, or severe diarrhea, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I also want you to follow up with me in a week to let me know how you're feeling. If your symptoms haven't improved, or if they've gotten worse, we’ll need to discuss getting that CT scan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. I will… finish the medicine. And I will… contact you if anything is wrong. And I will follow up. Thank you. I… I appreciate your help. Very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and I hope you start feeling better soon. Have a good day. .
