DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Lahn. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…bladder pressure, and it’s been concerning me. It’s difficult to describe, but it feels like I need to go quite often, even when I don’t really need to, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. Frequent urination and a feeling of pressure are definitely things we want to look into. To start, can you tell me a little more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a persistent feeling, low in my abdomen, right where my bladder is, of course. It isn't painful, exactly, but it's definitely uncomfortable and distracting. It seems to be worse in the mornings, and sometimes after I drink a lot of fluids, which seems counterintuitive, doesn’t it? I also notice it more when I’m stressed. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, yes. Worse in the mornings and with increased fluid intake, and exacerbated by stress… okay. And how long have you been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it began gradually, perhaps three or four months ago. At first, it was just occasional, and I dismissed it as needing to find a better restroom sooner. But over the last month or so, it’s become much more consistent, and… well, more bothersome. It’s starting to impact my daily routine, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over three to four months, becoming more consistent in the last month, and now affecting your daily routine. To get a better picture, can you tell me about how often you’re urinating during the day, roughly?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I suppose… normally, I would say every three or four hours. But now? It feels like almost every hour or two, even if it's just a small amount. And then I find myself getting up at least once, sometimes twice, during the night. It’s really disrupting my sleep, which is not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency – roughly every hour or two during the day, and nocturia – waking up one or two times a night to urinate. We should also discuss any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any burning or pain while urinating?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no burning or pain during urination. That’s one thing I was relieved about. I haven’t noticed any blood in my urine either. I suppose I have been feeling a little more tired lately, but I attributed that to just being busy. Is there anything else I should be looking for? Sometimes I feel like I don’t completely empty my bladder, but I'm not sure if that’s just my imagination.
DOCTOR: Good. No burning, pain, or blood is good. And fatigue is nonspecific, but we can keep that in mind. The sensation of incomplete emptying is something important to note. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with any of those. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had a UTI once, many years ago, when I was in college, but it was easily treated with antibiotics and I haven’t had a problem since. Other than that, just the usual childhood illnesses. As for diabetes, my doctor checks my blood sugar during my annual physical and it’s always been normal. I’m married, and my husband says I'm a bit of a worrywart, but I try to stay on top of things. Does my Medicare insurance cover any specific tests for this?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. And one previous UTI is helpful to know. I understand you're being proactive, and that's wonderful. And yes, Medicare should cover the tests we discuss. We'll start with a urinalysis – a simple urine sample to check for infection and other abnormalities. We may also do a post-void residual volume measurement to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. That’s a non-invasive test. Before we do those, let’s quickly go through some other things. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries at all. Not even a tonsillectomy as a child. I've always been lucky in that regard. I am a bit hesitant about tests, if you don't mind me saying. I've always been a little nervous around medical procedures, even simple ones. Could you explain the post-void residual volume measurement a little more? What does it involve exactly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your hesitation, and I’m happy to explain everything as thoroughly as possible. It’s perfectly normal to be a little nervous. The post-void residual volume measurement is very simple and non-invasive. After you urinate, we’ll use a small, handheld ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It doesn't involve any needles or catheters. It’s like a pregnancy ultrasound, but for your bladder. It's quick, painless, and gives us a good idea of how well your bladder is emptying. Does that make you feel a little more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make me feel better, thank you. Knowing it doesn't involve needles or catheters is a great relief. An ultrasound sounds much more manageable. Okay, I suppose I can agree to that. When would we do the tests? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? I always worry about forgetting something.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. We can do the urinalysis and ultrasound today. For the urinalysis, you just need to provide a clean urine sample – I’ll give you instructions for that in a private restroom. For the ultrasound, you don’t need to do anything special. Just drink a normal amount of fluids before your appointment, and try to empty your bladder as completely as possible when you urinate. I also want to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney disease, bladder problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother had diabetes, but it was diagnosed quite late in life. She managed it with diet and exercise for many years, though. My father had high blood pressure, but again, it was well-controlled. As far as kidney or bladder problems… not that I’m aware of. My grandparents were generally healthy; they lived to be quite old. I believe my maternal grandmother had a bladder infection once, a long time ago, but I don’t know many details. I’m reasonably sure there’s nothing major on either side of the family. Would it be helpful to ask my husband? He's very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Maternal diabetes and paternal hypertension are helpful to have. And it’s fine to ask your husband, if you think he remembers anything more specific. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I've never been a smoker. And my husband doesn’t either, thankfully. We both try to live a reasonably healthy lifestyle; we enjoy walking and gardening. We also try to eat a balanced diet, though we do enjoy the occasional indulgence. Is there anything else you need to know in that regard? I hope all this information is helpful. I'm just trying to be as thorough as possible.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. No smoking is excellent. And enjoying an active lifestyle and balanced diet is great. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies to medications. I’ve taken antibiotics in the past, as I mentioned, without any problems. I can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed, and I’ve never had a reaction to either. I've always been careful about checking for allergies before taking anything new, though. Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding medications? I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest. All these questions… I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. It's good to be thorough, and you're doing a great job. And no known allergies is good. Okay, let's take a breath. We've covered a lot. To summarise, you've been experiencing increased urinary frequency and pressure for about 3-4 months, worse in the mornings and with stress, with a sensation of incomplete emptying. No pain, blood, or fever. You have a history of one UTI, maternal diabetes, and paternal hypertension. You don’t smoke, have no known allergies, and have been generally healthy. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to assess your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. I suppose a physical exam is to be expected. I do have one small request, if you don't mind. I’m always a little… sensitive to cold. Would it be possible to have a blanket available, just in case? I apologize for being such a worrywart. I'm just trying to anticipate everything.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. We have blankets readily available. I will get one for you before we start. And please, don't apologize for wanting to be comfortable. It's perfectly reasonable. Now, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen and gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Alright, I'm ready. I appreciate you being so considerate, Dr. Lahn. It really does make a difference. I'll be sure to let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. I do tend to tense up easily, so please don't hesitate to tell me if I'm being too rigid.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take some nice deep breaths for me, please. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. I'm not feeling any obvious masses or areas of significant tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, but you do have some mild discomfort in the suprapubic region – that’s right above your pubic bone, where your bladder is located. It's not sharp pain, just a little sensitivity. Are you noticing that as well?
PATIENT: Yes, I am noticing that. It’s not painful, exactly, but it is a little tender there, as you said. It’s the same area where I’ve been feeling the pressure. It’s good to know you’ve found something, though. I was starting to worry that it was all in my head. What does that mean, do you think? Is it something serious? I apologize; I'm probably asking too many questions. I do tend to catastrophize.
DOCTOR: You're not catastrophizing at all. It’s perfectly normal to want to know what's going on, and asking questions is a good thing. The mild tenderness in the suprapubic region is consistent with bladder irritation. It doesn’t necessarily indicate something serious, but we need to investigate further to determine the cause. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, the most likely possibilities include a urinary tract infection, interstitial cystitis , or overactive bladder. Less common possibilities include bladder stones or, rarely, a mass. To help us narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a urinalysis and urine culture to check for infection. We also discussed the post-void residual volume measurement. Do you have any questions about those tests, or about what I’ve said so far?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. The urinalysis and urine culture to check for infection, and the ultrasound to see how much urine is left after I go to the bathroom… that all makes sense. Interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder… those sound a bit worrying, to be honest. Are they treatable? I suppose anything is treatable these days, but… is it something I’d have to live with for the rest of my life? I apologize; I’m really being a nervous patient, aren’t I? I do tend to overthink things.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a nervous patient at all. These are perfectly valid concerns, and I appreciate you voicing them. It's good to be informed. Both interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder are manageable conditions. They are rarely cured, but the symptoms can be significantly reduced with treatment. For interstitial cystitis, treatment options include lifestyle modifications , bladder training, medications, and, in some cases, physical therapy or injections. For overactive bladder, treatment options include bladder training, medications, and neuromodulation therapy. It’s important to remember that we haven’t made a diagnosis yet. The urinalysis and urine culture will help us rule out infection, which is the most common cause of your symptoms. We’ll take it one step at a time. Would you like me to explain the process for collecting a urine sample?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I think I understand the general idea, but I always worry about contaminating the sample. I’m terrible at following instructions, to be honest. I'm sure I'll do something wrong. Perhaps you could write it down for me, just in case? I do tend to forget things, even important ones. I apologize; I'm really being a handful, aren't I? I just want to make sure everything is done correctly.
DOCTOR: Not at all. I'm happy to write down the instructions for you. It’s always best to be thorough, and I want to make sure we get an accurate sample. Urine Sample Instructions 1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. Clean the genital area with the provided antiseptic wipe, wiping from front to back. 3. Start urinating into the toilet. 4. After about 30-60 seconds, collect the midstream portion of your urine into the sterile cup. Do not allow the cup to touch your skin. 5. Finish urinating into the toilet. 6. Bring the cup to the lab window immediately. It's important to collect the midstream portion of your urine, as this is the most accurate sample. And don’t worry about doing it perfectly. Just do your best. If you’re concerned, we can repeat the sample. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: No, those instructions are very clear, thank you. The midstream portion… and make sure the cup doesn't touch my skin… I think I can manage that. I’m going to go to the restroom now and collect the sample. I appreciate you being so patient with me, Dr. Lahn. It really does make a difference. I'll bring it to the lab window as soon as I'm finished. I’m hoping it’s just a simple infection. That would be a relief.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I’ll be right here when you get back. And I hope it’s something simple too. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
