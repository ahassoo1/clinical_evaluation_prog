DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have a rather full schedule, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about… well, my wife says I’ve been a bit… off. Confused, she calls it. I don’t really feel confused, but she insists. Keeps finding me staring into space, or asking the same questions twice. Honestly, she worries too much. But she made me come here, so here I am. It's been happening for…oh, maybe a month or so now? Not constantly, you understand. Just…episodes.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. "Episodes." Hmm. And you don't personally feel any difference in your cognitive function?
PATIENT: Cognitive…what now? Look, I feel fine. Perfectly normal. It’s just… sometimes I’ll be in the middle of something – fixing a tile, or watching the news – and I just… lose my train of thought. It’s not like I forget everything, Doctor. Just little things. And it's frustrating, I tell you. It’s not like I’m senile or anything. My memory is still sharp as a tack. I remember exactly which supplier gave me bad grout in '87, you know. Terrible stuff. Ruined a whole bathroom.
DOCTOR: Very well. A selective memory, then. And these "episodes," do they occur at a specific time of day?
PATIENT: Specific time? No, not that I've noticed. It’s random. Could be morning, could be afternoon. Sometimes it’s when I'm tired, maybe. But I’ve been working the same hours for thirty years, Doctor. I’m used to being tired. It’s a physical job, setting tile. Not some office job where you sit around all day. Though I suspect those people have their own troubles. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with anything. It's not like I'm falling down or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No. I eat perfectly fine. My wife makes a lovely fish amok, you know. And I always have a good appetite for that. She’s a good cook, that one. Always has been. Though she does fuss too much. Making sure I eat enough vegetables, that sort of thing. A woman's work, I suppose. I haven’t stopped enjoying my food. I’m not losing weight, if that’s what you’re getting at. Still a solid 112 pounds, last I checked. Though my wife keeps trying to get me to eat more. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, none. Never have. I don’t believe in filling my body with chemicals if I can avoid it. A little fish oil now and then, maybe, for the joints. But that’s it. I’ve always been a healthy man, Doctor. Worked hard all my life. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to, and frankly, I don’t see what this is all about. My wife is a bit of a hypochondriac, you know. Always reading those articles online…probably got it into her head that I'm coming down with something terrible. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And any family history of… cognitive decline, shall we say?
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? Goodness. Well, my mother… she did get a bit forgetful towards the end. But that was old age, Doctor. She lived to be ninety-three! Ninety-three, you hear? A long life. She forgot where she put her glasses all the time, and sometimes she'd repeat stories. But she was old. And my father, he was as sharp as a tack right until the day he… well, right until the day he wasn't. So, it's a mixed bag, I suppose. Doesn’t mean anything, does it? Everyone gets old eventually.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, Mr. Lason. Just to rule out any obvious underlying causes. It will be quick.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But don’t go poking around too much, Doctor. I’m a working man, not a science experiment. And please, try to be quick about it. I have a backsplash to finish on Elm Street this afternoon. A rather particular client, you see. Demands everything be perfectly level. You wouldn't believe the fuss…
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just sit up straight… First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. <listens with stethoscope> Heart rate is regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. <taps knees with reflex hammer> Reflexes are normal. And let me take a look at your eyes…<uses a penlight to examine eyes> Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious visual deficits. Now, I'm going to check your gait and balance. If you could stand up and walk a few steps for me, please. <observes patient walking> Walk appears steady, but slightly hesitant. Balance seems… adequate. <makes a note on the chart>
PATIENT: Hesitant? I was being careful! The floor is slippery, Doctor. And I don’t like being rushed, it throws me off. Honestly, you’re making me nervous now. I feel perfectly fine, you know. All this poking and prodding…it's unnecessary. I'm a tile setter, not some fragile old man. Thirty years I’ve been doing this, scaling ladders, carrying heavy loads. I’ve got good balance! You’re making a mountain out of a molehill, I tell you. My wife sends me here and now you’re making me feel worse. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I am simply conducting a routine evaluation, Mr. Lason. Your agitation is noted. Based on my preliminary assessment and your wife’s concerns, I suspect we are dealing with a relatively benign case of age-related cognitive changes. However, to be certain, I would like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I’d like to recommend a cognitive screening test. It’s a simple questionnaire, nothing to be alarmed about. <starts typing on the computer> We will also need to rule out any structural issues, so an MRI of the brain is also advisable.
PATIENT: MRI?! Now you’re just being ridiculous! A brain scan? For a little forgetfulness? This is exactly what I was afraid of. You're going to fill me with chemicals, poke around in my brain, and tell me I’m… what? Senile? I knew it! My wife sent me here to prove she's right and now you’re going along with it! I'm not doing any of that! Blood tests, fine. But no MRI, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’m a tile setter, not a guinea pig. And frankly, I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here today. <stands up abruptly> I'm leaving. You can send the bill to my wife. And tell her I said hello.
