DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington, good to see you. I’m Dr. Gorga. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one. Been going on for weeks now, and it just won’t heal. Honestly, I’ve seen better wounds on fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot… for weeks. Right. And you said it’s not healing?
PATIENT: Not healing! I've been putting creams on it, you know, the ones they sell at the drugstore. And wrapping it. My daughter, she told me to, but it's just getting worse. It's quite irritating, if I'm being honest. Really, a person would think something should have happened by now.
DOCTOR: Alright, creams and bandages… Okay. And where exactly on your foot is this sore?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s on the bottom, right near my toes. The big toe, actually. It’s…hard to explain. It's not on the toe, but right at the base of it. It's quite red, and…well, it smells a bit. Not my fault, of course. It just is. I keep it covered, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, base of the big toe, redness, and some odor... I see. Has this happened before, Mrs. Cannington?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, yes. A few times. Not this bad, mind you. But I've had little sores come and go. The nurse at the clinic back home always said it was my sugar. She said something about it making the blood vessels…well, I didn't quite understand. Something about not getting enough blood flow. It's always been a bit of a problem, this sugar. I try to watch it, but it's difficult. All those nice fruits, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, your sugar… and sores on your feet. Okay. Do you know what your sugar levels usually are?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not a clue. They poke and prod and give me numbers, but they just go in one ear and out the other. My daughter keeps track of it, I think. She's always telling me what I should be eating. Too much fuss, if you ask me. I’ve lived this long, haven't I? Eating what I like. It's probably just a bit of bad luck, this sore. A small thing, really. Though it is quite painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look at it. Could you please hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. It's not a pretty sight, I warn you. And try not to stare. There. Be careful, this old body isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay… yes, I see it. There's some redness and swelling, and a little bit of…discharge. It does look a bit deeper than just a surface wound. And it’s quite warm to the touch. I’m going to gently feel around it, just to see how sensitive it is. Tell me if that's painful. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that’s…uncomfortable. Quite tender, actually. Don't poke too hard, doctor. It feels…deep. Like it’s gone down into the foot itself. Not just a scrape, certainly. Honestly, it’s a miracle I can walk at all. My daughter says I should be using a walker, but I refuse. A walker is for old people. There! That’s particularly bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, I see. It does sound like it’s deeper than a simple scrape. And the warmth…that’s concerning. I’m going to write a few things down. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Hmm…sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly at night. It feels…like pins and needles. Not terribly painful, just…uncomfortable. It's hard to explain. It comes and goes. My daughter says it’s the sugar again, affecting my nerves. Honestly, it's probably just old age. Things stop working properly, you know? Like a rusty machine. Is it going to take long, doctor? My back is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, Mrs. Cannington. Okay, about the sugar…do you take any medication for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little white pill. Every morning. And sometimes at night, if I remember. My daughter has it all sorted out in those little plastic containers. She's very organized, that one. I don't even bother with it much, honestly. It makes me sleepy, and I have things to do! I don’t recall the name of it, though. It’s…a long name. Something about…metformin, perhaps? Or something like that. It all sounds the same after a while.
DOCTOR: Metformin, okay. And how often would you say you check your blood sugar?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When I have to. The clinic makes me do it sometimes. When I go for my check-ups. It's a hassle, poking my finger all the time. My daughter tries to get me to do it more often, but I just don't bother. I can feel when it’s too high. I get thirsty, and a bit shaky. That's enough for me. Honestly, I think they worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm seeing here, it looks like you may have an infected ulcer on your foot, complicated by poor sugar control. We need to get this under control quickly. An infection like this can become serious, especially with your age and potential circulation issues.
PATIENT: Infected? Oh, dear. That sounds…unpleasant. Circulation issues? I feel perfectly fine, doctor, except for this sore, of course. Are you saying I'm sick? I don't feel sick. And I certainly don’t need any…serious interventions. My daughter will be furious if I end up in the hospital. She already thinks I worry her enough. Honestly, it's probably just a bit of bad luck. Can't you just give me some stronger cream? Perhaps an antibiotic? I'd really rather not make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, I understand your concerns. We don’t want to jump to any drastic measures. However, an infection like this can quickly spread, especially if your sugar levels aren't well-controlled. Stronger cream might help a little, but it likely won't be enough. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your sugar levels and look for signs of infection. I’d also like to get an x-ray of your foot to see if the infection has spread to the bone. Based on those results, we can decide on the best course of action. We may need to consider antibiotics, and potentially a referral to a podiatrist to debride the wound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Debride? What does that mean? And a podiatrist? Honestly, doctor, you’re making this sound much worse than it is. I just want a simple solution. A cream, perhaps a bandage. My daughter always said I should elevate my foot. I can do that. And I'll try to eat a little less fruit. But no poking and prodding, and certainly no…debriding. I've lived a long life, you know. I don’t need any unnecessary procedures. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I just need a bit of help getting this sore to heal, that’s all. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington. I understand your reluctance. But debridement simply means removing any dead or infected tissue from the wound to allow it to heal properly. It's a common procedure, and it’s often necessary in cases like this. Look, I'm going to order the blood tests and the x-ray. Once we have those results, we can discuss all your options in more detail. We can potentially avoid more invasive treatments if the infection is mild. But we need to have a clear picture of what's going on first. I'll also send a referral to a podiatrist just so they can evaluate the wound. No obligation to follow up, alright?
