DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Sieh. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Schlatterer is…correct, yes. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s about…the college. The students. It’s quite dreadful, really. They simply don't appreciate knowledge anymore. It’s…exhausting, trying to instill some discipline.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated with the students and the challenges you're facing in your work. Just to clarify, you mentioned "the college" – are you a professor, or are you involved with the college in another capacity?
PATIENT: Professor. Library Science. Though what they learn these days hardly qualifies as science. And it’s not simply frustration, Doctor. It’s…a waste. A complete and utter waste of my expertise. I’ve been doing this for… well, a very long time. Before these…digital distractions. Honestly, I don't recall the specifics. Is this truly necessary to dwell on?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to understand what's been going on, Mr. Schlatterer, so I can best help you. And you're right, we can focus on what's most important now. You mentioned feeling a waste of your expertise… has this feeling been developing recently, or has it been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Decades, I should imagine. It’s… insidious. Slowly eroding. First, it was the books – the disrespect for physical volumes. Then the…the internet. Now? They barely read anything. Just…skim. And expect a grade! Honestly, the standards have simply plummeted. I don't even know why I bother anymore. It’s… demoralizing.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly disheartening, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s understandable that you’re feeling that way with such a long-term change and a decline in standards you’ve observed. Beyond the frustration with the students and the changes in the field, have you noticed any changes in your own energy levels, sleep, or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh, energy? What energy? I sleep… adequately, I suppose. Though I do wake frequently. Thinking. About…everything. And appetite… well, I eat. But it lacks…joy. Everything lacks joy, really. It’s just… a chore. Getting through the day. I used to be… vibrant. Engaged. Now? Just… existing. Is this what you want to hear? These personal details seem rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if they feel unnecessary, Mr. Schlatterer, but these details can be very important. It helps me understand the whole picture, and make sure there isn't something else going on that's contributing to how you're feeling. The changes in sleep, appetite, and your overall sense of joy are all things I want to be aware of. It sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of what we sometimes call… low mood, or perhaps even depression. But it’s important to explore this further. Have you felt this way consistently for the past two weeks or more?
PATIENT: Depression? Really? I wouldn’t… I don’t do depression. I’m a scholar! A professional! It’s… students. It's always the students. Though… two weeks… yes, perhaps longer. I suppose I’ve been rather… withdrawn. Even from my colleagues. They simply wouldn’t understand. Their concerns are… trivial. Honestly, I'm not sure what good this discussion is doing.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s not uncommon to feel that way, especially when you've always prided yourself on your strength and professionalism. And it's perfectly valid to feel frustrated with the students. What I'm trying to do is understand all the factors that might be contributing to how you're feeling, and explore all the possibilities. Sometimes, stress and frustration can manifest in ways that affect our mood and energy levels. Just to clarify, have you had any thoughts of hopelessness, or have you been experiencing any difficulty finding pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, aside from your work?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? No. I simply… expect less. From the world. From people. As for pleasure… well, my hobbies have fallen by the wayside. There simply isn’t time. Grading papers, preparing lectures… it’s endless. Honestly, it’s a pointless endeavor. Though I suppose… I used to enjoy… gardening. Before… everything. But now? It feels… burdensome. A chore, again. Really, Doctor, I’m not sure why I’m recounting my personal failings to you. This is hardly productive.
DOCTOR: You're not recounting failings, Mr. Schlatterer. You’re sharing valuable information that helps me understand what’s going on. And it is productive - it helps me get a clear picture of your situation. The loss of enjoyment in activities you used to love, like gardening, and the feeling of being burdened by tasks that once brought you joy, are all important pieces of the puzzle. It sounds like you’re experiencing several symptoms consistent with what we call a depressive episode. However, it’s important to rule out any other potential causes. Would you be open to a brief physical exam, just to check your overall health?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Really? What on earth for? It’s my mind, Doctor, not my body. I assure you, my physical health is…adequate. I manage. Though I do have a slight ache in my back… from years of hunching over books, I suppose. Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather… irritated. This feels like a complete waste of my time. I have papers to grade. And I sincerely doubt a physical exam will reveal anything of significance.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Schlatterer. You're right, it's quite possible the issue is primarily related to your mental well-being. However, sometimes physical conditions can contribute to or mimic symptoms of depression, and it's always best to rule out those possibilities, even if it's just to be thorough. The back ache you mentioned could be relevant, even if it seems minor. It's a quick check – blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, a basic neurological exam. It would take only a few minutes. If we rule out any physical causes, we can then focus entirely on addressing what’s going on with your mood and energy levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A quick check. Just to get it over with. But don’t expect any revelations. I assure you, my body is merely… reflecting the decay of civilization. And please, be quick about it. I have a mountain of papers waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll be as quick as possible. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. And breathe normally. 130 over 80… not bad. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs……Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… any shortness of breath or coughing lately?
PATIENT: No. Nothing of significance. A slight…dustiness, perhaps. From the books. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… unnecessary. I feel perfectly capable of self-diagnosis. Decades of scholarship have honed my observational skills. And the diagnosis, as I’ve repeatedly stated, is… the students. It's always the students.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Doctor, must we delve into such…personal matters? This is becoming increasingly… intrusive. Honestly, I fail to see the relevance. My digestive system, like everything else, is merely… functioning. Adequately. Though perhaps a little… sluggish, given the lack of joy in food. But that, I suspect, is a matter of the soul, not the stomach.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Schlatterer. It is a bit intrusive, and I apologize if it feels that way. I'm simply trying to rule out any underlying physical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling. Now, if you don't mind, I'm just going to check your reflexes... … good response here. And one more...... and here as well. Alright. Everything seems physically normal at this point. Now, given your report of low mood, loss of enjoyment, and social withdrawal, combined with the fact that there’s no apparent physical cause, I do believe you are experiencing symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder.
PATIENT: Depressive disorder? Really? Doctor, I assure you, I am perfectly rational. Perhaps a little… disillusioned. But a disorder? That sounds… rather severe. And frankly, insulting. I’ve dedicated my life to scholarship. I’ve contributed to the preservation of knowledge. I've graded countless papers! I simply find the current generation… lacking. It’s a matter of standards, not a psychological affliction. Honestly, I think I’ve had enough of this.
DOCTOR: I understand your reaction, Mr. Schlatterer. It is a difficult diagnosis to hear, and it’s perfectly natural to feel skeptical and defensive. And you’re absolutely right – your dedication to scholarship and your contributions to knowledge are admirable. However, a depressive disorder isn’t a sign of weakness or a reflection of your intelligence or accomplishments. It’s a medical condition, just like any other, with specific causes and effective treatments. And it can affect anyone, regardless of their background or achievements. The symptoms you’ve described – the low mood, loss of enjoyment, social withdrawal – those are all hallmarks of depression. It sounds like you're going through a difficult time, and I want to assure you that you're not alone. Would you be open to discussing some treatment options?
PATIENT: Treatment? Honestly, Doctor, what sort of treatment are you suggesting? Pills? Therapy? I assure you, I don’t need pills. And I certainly don’t need to discuss my feelings with a… stranger. I’ve spent my life analyzing the great thinkers. I’ve developed my own coping mechanisms. Self-discipline. A rigorous schedule. And a firm belief in the importance of knowledge. Honestly, I think the best course of action would be… to retire. To remove myself from the… the influence of these… students. Would that be acceptable?
DOCTOR: Retirement is certainly a valid option, Mr. Schlatterer, and if that's what you feel is best for you, I fully support that. However, even if you retire, the symptoms you’re experiencing – the low mood, loss of enjoyment, social withdrawal – those might not simply disappear. There are effective treatments available that can help you regain your sense of joy and purpose, regardless of your work situation. One option is therapy, also known as counseling. It’s a safe and confidential space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies. And another option is medication, which can help regulate your brain chemistry and alleviate your symptoms. You don't have to choose either one right away. We can discuss the pros and cons of each option, and decide together what’s best for you. Would you be open to at least learning more about these options?
PATIENT: Learn more? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve spent a lifetime teaching people. I don’t need to be lectured. And medication? Absolutely not. I refuse to introduce artificial chemicals into my system. I’ve always prided myself on my…natural constitution. And frankly, I find the entire suggestion…demeaning. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of managing my own affairs. I simply need… peace and quiet. And a respite from the… the relentless mediocrity of the modern world. Honestly, I think I’ve wasted enough of your time. And frankly, my own.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s clear you have strong feelings about this, and I respect your decision. I won’t push you to do anything you're not comfortable with. However, I do want to gently reiterate that depression is a medical condition, and it's not something you should simply "tough out" on your own. It can have a significant impact on your quality of life, and there are treatments available that can help. If you ever change your mind, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m happy to provide you with resources and support. In the meantime, if you are considering retirement, I can certainly provide you with a note for your employer, outlining your current condition. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A note, yes. That would be… acceptable. Just stating the fact that I’m… seeking a change of pace. No mention of… disorders. Please. And honestly, Doctor, I think this concludes our… interaction. I have papers to grade, if you’ll excuse me. And a world to lament.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll write a note stating that you are seeking a change of pace. No mention of any specific diagnosis. I will have my assistant print it out for you before you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, despite the…difficult circumstances. Please take care of yourself, and remember that you deserve to find peace and happiness. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic.
PATIENT: .
