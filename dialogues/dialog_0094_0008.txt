DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. Right. Well, it's my ear, you see. Feels... blocked. Full, like something’s in there. It’s been bothering me for a bit now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Time… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Time certainly can do that. Blocked and full… and you said “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit. Weeks, maybe? Or months? It’s hard to pinpoint. It doesn't hurt, exactly. More… annoying. Like when you’re on an airplane, that pressure. Sort of like that, but not as bad. And it’s just the one ear, my left one. I think. I'd have to really concentrate to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so weeks to months, mostly on the left side, and it feels like pressure, similar to airplane ears but less intense. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the blocked feeling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No dizziness, I don’t think. And I haven’t noticed any pain, like you asked before. Maybe a little… trouble hearing sometimes? But I’ve always had a bit of trouble hearing, to be honest. My wife used to… well, never mind. It's probably just the ear. I don't really know.
DOCTOR: No dizziness or pain, and some trouble hearing, which you've experienced previously. Have you noticed any discharge from your ear, or any ringing in either ear?
PATIENT: Discharge… no, definitely not. And ringing… Sometimes, maybe? A very faint ringing. But I live near the trams, you see, so I always assumed it was that. It's hard to tell what's what, to be honest. A little buzz here and there. Nothing major. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a faint ringing that you attribute to the trams nearby. That’s helpful information. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Oh dear. Everything’s a bit of a blur. I think I had something back in… spring, maybe? A bit of a cough, a sniffle. Nothing serious, I just stayed home for a few days. It didn’t last long. I honestly can't remember much else. It felt like every other cold, you know? I get them sometimes. Is that…relevant?
DOCTOR: It could be. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. He put me on… a little white pill. I take it every morning. Other than that… I don't think so. Nothing major. And my wife… she was the one who always remembered these things. Now it’s all a bit… foggy. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's perfectly understandable. You mentioned a white pill for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t. It’s a little white pill. I get it refilled every month at the pharmacy on the corner. They know me there. I’m afraid I don’t pay much attention to the names. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this ear to stop feeling blocked. It’s distracting. Is there anything you can do about that?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. We'll certainly try to figure out what's going on. Before we proceed, let’s quickly review your surgical history and allergies, if any. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. That’s all I can remember. And… no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. My wife used to make a wonderful shellfish stew… But that was… a long time ago. Sorry to keep rambling. I just want to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: No allergies and tonsillectomy in childhood. Okay. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’d like to take a look at your ear now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Please, go ahead. The sooner the better, really. Hopefully you can see something. I appreciate you looking. It’s just… irritating, you know? And I’ve got a few things I need to get done today. So, if you could be quick… that would be lovely.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I see a bit of wax buildup and some slight redness in the ear canal. The eardrum itself appears intact, but it’s slightly muffled. This could explain the blocked feeling and some of the difficulty with hearing. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but the wax buildup needs to be addressed. I recommend we remove the wax, which should alleviate your symptoms. Are you comfortable with that?
