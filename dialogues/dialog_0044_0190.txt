DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Asami. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been… unsteady. A bit wobbly, I suppose. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s… concerning. I work with heavy machinery, you see, and… well, one needs to be quite firm on one’s feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, “unsteady” and “wobbly.” That’s a good start. And understanding that it impacts your work is important. Could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, actually. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It feels like… several months, perhaps? Maybe longer? It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully. It began gradually, I think. Not a sudden thing. My husband… he noticed it first, I believe. But… he’s passed now, so I don't have a precise timeline. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all. It's perfectly understandable, especially given your loss. Several months, gradually worsening… that gives us something to work with. Can you describe how unsteady you feel?
PATIENT: That’s… kind of you to say. Um… it’s not a constant thing. Some days are better than others. When it’s bad… it feels like the room is tilting, slightly. Or… like I’m tilting. It’s hard to describe. And sometimes, it’s just a feeling of being… off-balance. Like I could easily fall, even when I’m standing still. It hasn’t happened yet, thankfully, but it’s… unnerving. It's worse when I turn my head quickly, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, worse with quick head movements, feeling of tilting or off-balance... That sounds like it could be a few different things. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Let me think. Sometimes… a slight dizziness, perhaps? Not a full-blown spinning sensation, more like a… a lightness in my head. And occasionally… a bit of nausea. Not severe, but… present. I haven’t vomited, if that’s what you’re asking. And… now that I mention it, my vision seems… a bit blurry sometimes. But I wear glasses, so I assumed it was just my prescription needing adjustment. It's difficult to say what's connected and what isn't, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Lilyanna. Dizziness, nausea, and blurry vision… those can certainly be related. Let’s try to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you had any changes in your hearing or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Changes in my hearing… that’s a good question. I haven't consciously noticed any difference. I work around quite a lot of loud machinery, you see, so I suppose some degree of hearing loss would be… expected over time. I haven’t had any ringing in my ears, no. Though… now that you mention it, there's been a sort of… pressure feeling in my ears sometimes. Not painful, just… a fullness. It comes and goes. I didn't think it was particularly important.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in the ears, intermittent fullness… that adds another piece to the puzzle. We’ll definitely want to investigate that further. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… I had a rather severe bout of the flu several years ago, required hospitalization. I also have… had high blood pressure, for quite some time. It’s been managed with medication, thankfully. My husband… he always handled refilling the prescriptions and making sure I took them regularly. I’ve been a bit… disorganized since he passed. I think I'm still taking the correct dosage, but I wouldn't swear to it. Aside from that… nothing significant comes to mind. I haven’t had any surgeries or… major illnesses, as far as I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of the flu requiring hospitalization and managed high blood pressure. It's good you've been managing the blood pressure, and we'll certainly get that checked today. The medication adherence is something we’ll address as well. Can you tell me what medications you're currently taking, if you know them?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit difficult. I have the bottles somewhere, I think. I’ll have to rummage through things when I get home. I believe one is for the blood pressure, a small white pill. And… I take something for my cholesterol, I think. A yellow capsule. I’m afraid I don’t recall the names, and… honestly, I’m not very good at remembering things like that. I rely heavily on my pharmacy to remind me. I apologize for being so vague. It’s… frustrating for me as well.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly understandable. We'll get a list from the pharmacy, so don’t worry about trying to recall them right now. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… a tricky one. My mother had some heart trouble later in life. And my father… he had diabetes. But… I don’t know much beyond that. My family… we weren’t very close. And I wasn’t particularly involved in their medical affairs. I believe my grandmother… on my mother’s side… had something with her balance. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. I’m sorry I can’t be of more help. It's… distant memories, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble, diabetes, and a possible balance issue on your mother's side. That's helpful to know, even if the details are limited. Finally, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’ve never been inclined towards alcohol. And… recreational drugs are… entirely out of the question. I lead a rather quiet life, truthfully. Work keeps me busy, and… well, I don’t socialize much anymore. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly relevant, Lilyanna, thank you for sharing. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. Alright, let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then do a neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Please, proceed at your own pace. I’m… a little anxious, truthfully, but I understand it’s necessary. I'll do my best to cooperate. Just… let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilyanna. I’ll explain everything as we go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within normal limits. Now, could you please walk a few steps for me, normally?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… alright? I’m trying to be as steady as possible. It feels… a little awkward, truthfully. I’m quite aware of my feet, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, could you walk heel-to-toe, placing the heel of one foot directly in front of the toes of the other, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little difficult. I’m… not very graceful, I’m afraid. It feels… very unstable. I’m afraid I might fall.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Lilyanna, you're doing fine. It’s important that you tell me when something feels difficult or unstable. What I'm seeing is a bit of unsteadiness and difficulty with coordination. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This will involve a small hammer to your knees and ankles. It shouldn't be painful, but let me know if it is uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. A small hammer? I suppose… it can’t be worse than the machinery at work. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. I’m a little anxious, as you know. And… warn me before you strike, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. I will be very gentle and will warn you each time. Alright, reflexes are present, but a little bit on the weaker side. Now, let's check your eyes. I'm going to have you follow my finger with your gaze. This will help me assess your vision and eye movements. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly alright. My vision… hasn’t been quite the same lately, as I mentioned. Is that… alright? I'm trying my best to keep my gaze fixed on your finger. It feels… a little difficult to follow, truthfully. Is it… wobbling?
DOCTOR: I do notice a slight wobble in your eye movements, Lilyanna. It’s called nystagmus. It can be associated with several things. Based on what I’ve seen today – the unsteady gait, diminished reflexes, and nystagmus – I think it would be helpful to order some further testing. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an MRI of your brain. The MRI will help us rule out any structural abnormalities. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… rather serious. Is it… is it something to be worried about, Doctor? I mean… what could it be? I work around heavy machinery, you see, and… I need to be alert. I can't afford to be… incapacitated. The MRI… will it take long? And… will it be painful? I apologize for all the questions, but… I’m rather anxious, as you can imagine. Perhaps… perhaps it's just my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious, Lilyanna. It’s my job to answer your questions and alleviate your concerns. The MRI is not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but it’s a necessary step to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It helps us rule out potential causes. It could be anything from a minor issue to something more significant, and we need to investigate to be sure. As for the MRI itself, it's a painless procedure. You’ll lie inside a large magnet, and it takes about 30-45 minutes. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to remain very still. We’ll provide you with earplugs and clear instructions before the procedure. In the meantime, let's focus on managing your blood pressure. I’m going to prescribe a medication to help lower it, and I want you to monitor it regularly at home. Would you like me to explain the medication and how to monitor your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I’m… not very good with medications, as I mentioned. I rely heavily on my pharmacy, but… I would like to be more informed, if possible. And… the blood pressure monitoring… what kind of device do I need? And… how often should I check it? I apologize for all the questions, but… I feel rather overwhelmed, truthfully. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely alright, Lilyanna. You’re not overwhelming me at all. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I’m here to help you through it. The medication I'm prescribing is called Lisinopril. It's a common blood pressure medication, and it's generally well-tolerated. You'll take one 10mg tablet each day, preferably in the morning. It's important to take it at the same time each day to maintain consistent levels in your body. As for the blood pressure monitor, you can purchase a home blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. It's a relatively inexpensive device. You should check your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning before you take your medication, and once in the evening. Record your readings in a notebook or on a smartphone app. Bring the readings with you to your next appointment so we can track your progress. Are you writing this down?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… 10mg… once a day… morning… record readings… twice a day… morning and evening… Yes… yes, I’m writing it down. And… what if my blood pressure is still high, even after taking the medication? Should I… increase the dosage myself? Or… should I call the pharmacy? I don’t want to… do anything wrong. This is… rather daunting, truthfully. I’m used to my husband handling all of this.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Lilyanna. Never adjust the dosage of any medication yourself. That can be dangerous. If your blood pressure remains high after a few days of taking the medication, please call my office, and we'll schedule an appointment to reassess your situation. We may need to adjust the dosage or try a different medication. And if you experience any side effects – dizziness, lightheadedness, persistent cough – please contact my office immediately. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for the MRI and further evaluation. They are the specialists in this area and will be able to provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any questions about the referral, or would you like me to explain the process?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds… rather serious. But… if it's necessary, I suppose. What… what exactly will they do? Will it be… painful? And… will it take long? I’m afraid of… enclosed spaces. Will the MRI machine be… small? I apologize for all the questions, but… I’m rather claustrophobic, truthfully. And… will I need someone to drive me? I don't want to… put anyone out. This is… a lot to take in. I'm used to my husband handling all of this.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be anxious, Lilyanna. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to address them. The neurologist will review your medical history, perform a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and balance, and then order the MRI to get a clearer picture of your brain. As for the MRI, it’s a painless procedure, as we discussed. The machine is a large, open cylinder, but it can feel enclosed to some people. Many MRI centers offer open MRI machines, which are less confining. We can request an open MRI for you if that would make you more comfortable. You can absolutely bring someone with you for support, and it’s a good idea, especially if you're feeling anxious. It’s also a good idea to have someone drive you home, as you may feel a little tired after the procedure. I will provide you with the neurologist's contact information, and they will be able to answer any specific questions you have about the procedure. I'm also happy to write a note to the neurologist mentioning your claustrophobia so they can accommodate your needs. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: An open MRI… yes, that would be… much better. Thank you. And… a note mentioning my claustrophobia… that would be… very kind. I… I think I understand. It's… a lot to take in, truthfully. I'm used to my husband handling all of this. I… I just… I miss him so much. He always knew what to do. I feel… so lost without him. I apologize for… breaking down. I'm usually… stronger than this. Is it alright if… I just… sit here for a moment? I just need… a few minutes to compose myself.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. Take all the time you need. There’s absolutely no need to apologize. Grief is a very personal journey, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. I’m here to listen if you need to talk, but it’s also perfectly alright to just sit in silence. We've covered a lot today. To recap, we're going to start you on Lisinopril for your blood pressure, and you’ll monitor it twice a day. We're getting a referral to a neurologist for an MRI, and we’ll request an open MRI. And I will write a note mentioning your claustrophobia. Is there anything else I can do for you today, or any other questions you have?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… all. You’ve been… very kind, Doctor Asami. And… patient. I apologize for being so… emotional. I think… I think I just needed someone to… explain everything. And… to listen. You’ve… given me some hope. Thank you. Truly. I… I think I can manage now. I’ll… I’ll schedule an appointment with the neurologist tomorrow. And… I’ll start the medication tonight. I… I should be going now. I don’t want to… take up any more of your time. Thank you again, Doctor Asami. You’ve been… a great help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Take care of yourself, and don't be afraid to lean on your loved ones. .
