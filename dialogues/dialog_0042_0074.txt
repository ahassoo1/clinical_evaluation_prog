DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. Well, my blood pressure’s been actin’ up lately. Old man told me to come get it checked. He’s gone now, bless his heart, but he always worried about that blood pressure of mine.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. It's very thoughtful of your husband to look after you so well, even now. And it’s good you're getting it checked. High blood pressure can be very sneaky. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “actin’ up”?
PATIENT: Well, I get these headaches sometimes, feelin' kinda dizzy. Not all the time, mind ya, but enough to bother me. And sometimes when I’m bakin’, I get real short of breath, even just stirrin’ a batter. It weren’t like that before. I mostly just chalked it up to gettin' older, but…figured I best get it looked at.
DOCTOR: I understand. Headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath – those are all things we should definitely investigate. It’s always best to rule things out, and you’re right to come in. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s been…oh, maybe three, four months now? Started slow, just a little tired after a long day in the kitchen. Then the headaches started, and the breathin’ got worse. It's hard to say exactly, time kinda blurs when you're old, ya know? But 'round three months, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Venna. Time does have a way of slipping away. About three months then. And the symptoms seem to be gradually worsening, as you've noticed. Are the headaches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go. Mostly in the afternoons, seems like. Or if I been standin’ a long time bakin’. Not every day, and not all day long. They ain’t the worst headaches I ever had, but they’re…naggin’. Like a little pebble in yer shoe, ya know? Just enough to bother ya. And they don't really go away with just one pain killer, either. Gotta let 'em ride it out sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, a “little pebble in your shoe” – that’s a very good way to describe it. And the fact that they don’t fully respond to over-the-counter pain medication is good to know. Now, aside from the headaches and shortness of breath, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision…well, now that ya mention it…seems a little blurry sometimes. Especially when I’m readin’ recipes. I always thought it was just my eyes gettin’ old, and I been meanin’ to get 'em checked at the eye doctor, but…well, one thing leads to another, ya know? I mostly just hold the recipe closer to my face. It ain't been too bad, just…a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little fuzzy is good information to have, Venna. It’s helpful to know that you’ve noticed some changes in your vision along with the headaches and shortness of breath. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Doc always told me I was healthy as a horse, just a little high blood pressure. He kept me on a little pill for it for years, but I stopped takin' it a while back. Figured I was doin’ okay, watchin’ my salt and all. Now I'm wonderin’ if that was a mistake. Like I said, he’s gone now, and I just…stopped. I didn't see a reason to keep takin' it if I wasn’t feelin' sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for people to adjust medications based on how they feel, especially after a long-term doctor-patient relationship ends. Stopping a blood pressure medication can certainly contribute to changes in your blood pressure, and it's good you mentioned that. Do you remember the name of the medication you were taking?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a hard one. It was a little white pill…and I think it started with an “A”? Or maybe a “D”? Lord, my memory ain’t what it used to be. It was a small pill, that’s all I remember. I been takin’ pills for so long, they all kinda run together. I can't rightly recall the name. Sorry, dear.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. Don't worry about it at all. It's not essential right now. We can often figure things out from your records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think…No, not really. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbin’ a tree, but that was a long time ago. And I had my tonsils out when I was young. Other than that…no, I've been pretty lucky, knock on wood. Always been a strong, healthy woman. Until lately, that is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major surgeries or hospitalizations. You’ve certainly lived a long and healthy life, it sounds like. Now, could you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my husband, bless his heart, passed a few years back. We never had children. I got a sister, Sarah, lives over in Tahlequah. She's a bit younger than me. And I got a nephew and a grand-nephew, but I don’t see them too often. We ain’t real close. Mostly just exchange Christmas cards. My parents are gone now too, both passed many years ago. I’m the last one left from my side of the family, I reckon. It gets lonely sometimes, bein' the last one.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your losses, Venna. It's hard losing loved ones, and especially being the last one in the family. Did any of your family members have any health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: My mama, she had kinda bad arthritis, real bad. And my daddy, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. Not sure exactly what kinda trouble, but he had to slow down a lot in his later years. And my sister, Sarah, she's got high blood pressure too, like me. She takes pills for it, though. Always been real good about takin’ care of herself. I reckon it runs in the family, this blood pressure thing.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information. Knowing about the family history of arthritis, heart problems and high blood pressure gives us a better picture. Now, I just want to ask a few questions about your daily habits. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, honey. Not a drop. Never liked the taste of either one. My husband, he used to have a little beer now and then, but I never touched the stuff. I always thought it was a waste of good money. And smokin'? Lord, no. Never could understand folks who'd willingly put somethin' like that in their lungs. No, I stick to my tea and bakin’. That's all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my arthritis cream for my hands, sometimes. When they get real achy. And I take a little calcium for my bones, 'cause the doctor told me to years ago. That's about it. Nothin' fancy. Just tryin' to keep these old bones workin' as long as I can. I don't take much, I don't. I always liked to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna, thank you for answering all of my questions. That gives me a very good understanding of your health history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, dear. Just try not to poke around too much. These old bones are kinda fragile, ya know? But go ahead, do what ya need to do. I trust ya. Let's get this over with, so I can get back to my bakin'. I got a pie crust needs rollin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I’ll be very gentle. We’ll take it slow. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, as you suspected. I'm hearing a slight murmur – a whooshing sound – when I listen to your heart, which is something we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, but I do notice some slight swelling in your ankles. And your hands do show some signs of arthritis, as you mentioned. I’m going to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds serious, don’t it? A murmur…and swelling…Lord. Blood work and an EKG… Well, I s’pose if ya think it’s best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just get it done, so I know what I’m dealin’ with. And…how long will it take? I got a batch of biscuits needs bakin' for the church social next week.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re getting checked out, Venna. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to rule things out. The blood work and EKG will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. The results will then need to be reviewed. I’ll let you know as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now, and then we'll get the EKG done. Would you like me to call someone to come with you for support?
PATIENT: No, honey, that's alright. I can manage. I been doin' things on my own for a long time now. Just get it over with, so I can get back home. I got a pie crust needs rollin’, remember? And biscuits to bake. Don't want to keep those church folks waitin’. Let’s get to it then. Thank ya for your time, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I understand. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and get the EKG set up. I'll be right back to check on you once the tests are complete. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
