DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I haven't much time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. A nuisance, more like it. It's a white coating in my mouth. My wife insisted I come. She worries over everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be a little awkward talking about things like this, but that's what I'm here for. And it's good your wife encouraged you to come in – it’s always best to get things checked out. A white coating in your mouth… can you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t pay close attention to such things. Perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. I eat, I sleep, I work. It’s not as if I’m examining the inside of my mouth daily, Doctor. It just… appeared. And it won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A week or so. Has it been getting worse, staying the same, or does it seem to fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate, I suppose. Some days it’s less noticeable, others… well, it’s quite prominent. It doesn’t hurt, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… unsightly. And my wife keeps offering me strange teas. It's quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just the visual change and the teas, got it. Does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: No. Nothing I’ve noticed. I eat the same things, drink the same coffee… I haven’t changed my routine. It’s simply… there. Really, Doctor, I'm a busy man. I fall trees. It requires concentration. This is a distraction.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you haven't changed anything in your diet?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Same breakfast, same lunch, the same dinner my wife prepares. She's very particular about my diet, you see. Very healthy, she says. Although, this hasn't prevented… this. It’s rather frustrating, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. No, Doctor, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, despite this… issue. I need my lungs clear for work. It’s a dangerous profession.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. My wife always checks when she makes me try new things, and I haven’t had any reactions. She’s quite thorough, as I’ve mentioned. It’s a blessing, really, though sometimes… overbearing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I prefer to avoid all those… chemicals. My wife tries to give me vitamins sometimes, but I generally decline. I get everything I need from my diet, thank you very much. It’s all very natural.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look in your mouth. Can you open wide for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick. I have a schedule to keep. It’s not as if this is a pleasant experience.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. The coating appears mostly on your tongue and inner cheeks. It's not extensive, but it is present. No obvious sores or lesions. It looks like a case of oral thrush, or candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection. Not usually serious, but can be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Fungal infection? In my mouth? That sounds… unpleasant. Is it contagious? My wife and I… well, we share things. And I’m on a job site all day. I don’t need to be spreading… fungus. This is highly inconvenient. Is there a cream? Something quick?
DOCTOR: It's not usually a major concern. It's commonly seen, especially if your immune system is a little off, or if you've recently taken antibiotics. As for being contagious, it can be spread through saliva, but it's not highly contagious. It’s not something you’d catch like a cold. And yes, there is treatment. Usually an antifungal mouthwash or lozenges are effective. We can start with a mouthwash, and if that doesn’t clear it up within a week or so, we can consider a lozenge or even an oral medication. I’ll write you a prescription for Nystatin oral suspension – you swish with it for a few minutes after meals, then spit it out. It can make your mouth feel a little strange at first. I’ll also recommend good oral hygiene - brushing twice a day, flossing, and drinking plenty of water.
PATIENT: A mouthwash. Fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my coffee. And it won't take long, will it? I have a deadline to meet next week, and I can’t afford to be… incapacitated. Is there anything else I need to know? Any restrictions? Any… side effects I should be aware of? I’d prefer a concise list, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s keep it concise. The Nystatin shouldn't interfere with your coffee, but try to avoid sugary drinks as they can feed the fungus. Side effects are minimal – sometimes a little nausea or upset stomach, or a change in taste, but those are rare. If you experience any significant side effects, stop using it and let me know. Restrictions: None major, just use as directed and try to maintain good oral hygiene. I’ll also recommend you let your wife know, so she can be aware and avoid sharing utensils or drinks until it clears up, just to be cautious. Here's the prescription and some basic information. If it doesn’t improve within a week, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No. I believe that covers it. My wife will be happy to know I’m taking precautions. And frankly, I’m eager to be rid of this. Hopefully, this mouthwash does the trick. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… efficiency. I should be going now. I have a tree waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. You’re very welcome. I hope you feel better soon, and get back to your trees. If you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
