DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s… well, it’s rather inconvenient, you understand. Things just… aren’t working properly. My vision, and my hearing… they’ve both gone rather suddenly. It’s most disruptive. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes, I understand. Sudden changes are concerning. Let's try to be methodical. When you say “suddenly,” can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A few days, perhaps? It's all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I don’t keep precise records of such… inconveniences. It was after my book club meeting, I believe. Though, what exactly happened then is… fuzzy. It's not as if I spend my time cataloging the deterioration of my senses, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. A few days. And to clarify, both your vision and hearing declined around the same time, following your book club meeting?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s correct. Though, I fail to see what my leisure activities have to do with this… deterioration. Really, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman. I eat properly, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more regularly. This must be some sort of… fluke. A temporary setback, I should think. I haven’t got time for prolonged illness.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll determine the cause. Let’s start with your vision. Describe what you’re experiencing. Is it blurry vision, double vision, loss of vision in certain areas… any specific changes you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s just… gone dim. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? Everything is… muted. Not entirely dark, you understand, but lacking… clarity. And it’s quite distressing. I enjoy reading, you see. It’s… difficult to concentrate when one can’t properly see the words. Though, perhaps the book selection was simply poor. It was a rather modern novel, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Dimmed vision, like looking through a dirty window. And difficulty concentrating due to the poor clarity. Now, regarding your hearing. Describe that for me. Is it a ringing in your ears, muffled sounds, difficulty understanding conversations?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… distant. Everything sounds as though it’s coming from underwater, if that makes any sense. People are mumbling, I suspect. Or they simply aren’t enunciating properly. It’s very frustrating, you understand. I have a rather discerning ear. I do hope this won’t take too long. I have luncheon plans.
DOCTOR: Distant sounds, muffled as if underwater. Difficulty understanding people. Alright. Let's move on to your medical history, Ms. Julie. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Really, Doctor, are you implying I have medical conditions? I’ve always been a very robust woman. Though… well, my divorce was rather stressful. Perhaps that affected something. But I hardly consider marital discord a “medical condition.” And I had a rather nasty bout of the flu, oh, several years ago. But I recovered perfectly well. Is this truly relevant?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your robustness, Ms. Julie, stress can certainly exacerbate certain conditions, and a history of illness is always relevant. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Good heavens, no! I’ve always prided myself on avoiding hospitals. They’re… dreadful places. Full of germs and unpleasant smells. I haven’t the faintest idea why anyone would choose to spend time in a hospital. Though… my mother was hospitalized near the end, of course. But that was unavoidable. A very sad affair. I really don’t see what this is accomplishing.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Let’s shift gears then. Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little something for my… well, for my nerves. Just occasionally, you understand. When things get particularly… trying. And a vitamin D supplement, I believe. Dr. Ramirez suggested it. Though, I can’t quite recall the dosage. I’m simply not one for keeping track of such trivial details. It’s all rather unimportant, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I've lived a full life, travelled extensively. I've eaten all sorts of things. I am not prone to… weaknesses such as allergies. Though… I recall a slight rash once, after trying a new brand of hand cream. But it cleared up almost immediately. It was probably the scent. I simply prefer unscented products now. Really, I believe we've exhausted the pertinent details. Can we move on? I have a very important bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Before we proceed, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, Ms. Julie. Just to assess your vision and hearing, and check your overall neurological function. It will only take a few moments. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Doctor, are you serious? I’ve already explained my symptoms. I assure you, there’s nothing physically wrong with me. It’s likely just a temporary… aberration. I simply haven’t got time for poking and prodding. I lead a very busy life, you understand. I think I’ll just go. Perhaps this will resolve itself on its own. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, with all due respect, I strongly advise against foregoing a proper examination. Your symptoms warrant further investigation. I understand your schedule is busy, but your health is paramount. I cannot offer a diagnosis without assessing your condition. If you refuse, I can document that, and I would recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist and audiologist for a second opinion. However, I must emphasize that delaying evaluation could potentially worsen the underlying issue. Please reconsider.
