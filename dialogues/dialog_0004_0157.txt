DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: “Feel fine,” is good to hear, but hypertension is rarely symptomatic until it becomes a problem. The nurse likely flagged it during your routine check-up, and it’s good we’re addressing it now. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about why you feel it doesn’t need addressing?
PATIENT: Look, I work outside. I'm a civil engineering tech – I’m on my feet all day, checking sites, moving equipment. It's physical work. My husband says it’s probably just…you know…normal. He's a contractor, he understands these things. I don't sit around eating junk food. I don’t need to be poked and prodded because a machine said something.
DOCTOR: I understand your husband has experience with physical labor, and that you maintain an active lifestyle. However, even with good health habits, blood pressure can still be elevated. It's not solely about diet and exercise. We need to rule out any underlying causes and prevent potential complications. “Normal” blood pressure for your age is typically around 120/80. What were your numbers, as recorded by the nurse?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t remember the exact numbers. Something over 140, I think? She kept saying “systolic” and “diastolic” and it just sounded like a lot of medical jargon I didn’t need to hear. It's just… a number. I’m busy. Can we just skip all this and maybe write a prescription or something?
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Ms. Dudney, prescribing medication without a proper assessment would be irresponsible. “Just a number” is…a rather dismissive way to view a critical health indicator. Hypertension, if left untreated, can lead to serious issues: stroke, heart attack, kidney damage…These aren't things to take lightly. Let's start with a basic review. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is all new. And frankly, it's a waste of my time. I have a job site meeting this afternoon, and I’m already running late. Is there anything quick you can do? Like, can you just take my blood pressure again and see if it's lower now? Maybe it was just a fluke.
DOCTOR: We can retake your blood pressure, certainly. However, a single reading is rarely definitive. It fluctuates with stress, activity…various factors. Before we do that, I need to ask a few questions to get a broader picture. It will only take a few minutes. Have you been experiencing any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes recently?
PATIENT: No. None of that. I told you, I feel fine. Look, I barely have time to sleep as it is. My husband helps with the kids, but I still handle most of the household stuff, you know? This whole thing just feels like unnecessary drama. Can we just…get this over with?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical exam then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your reflexes. It will be fairly quick. Please sit back and relax. Deep breath in…and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, I'm going to take your blood pressure again.
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry. I have things to do. And honestly, all this poking and prodding is making me nervous, and that probably raises my blood pressure, doesn't it? It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. As you suspected, it's elevated. While your nervousness may contribute slightly, this is significantly higher than the acceptable range, even accounting for that. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about your family history. Does anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—have a history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: My grandfather on my mother’s side… he had something wrong with his heart. I think it was…enlarged. He didn't take care of himself. Smoked a lot, drank too much. Didn't really listen to doctors. But that was a long time ago. And honestly, I don’t see what that has to do with me. I'm completely different. I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Family history is relevant, Ms. Dudney, even if lifestyles differ. Genetic predisposition plays a role. Now, do you currently take any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, but like, once or twice a month. Nothing regular. Look, can we please just talk about what we’re going to do about this? Are you going to give me a pill or what? I don’t have time for a twenty-minute lecture on genetics.
DOCTOR: A “pill” isn’t always the answer, Ms. Dudney. We need to consider lifestyle modifications first. However, given your reading and family history, I believe we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work: a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to assess your heart function. I also recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor to get a more accurate reading throughout the day. In the meantime, I want you to start monitoring your blood pressure at home—twice daily—and keep a log. We'll review the results at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Blood work, monitor, two weeks. Just get me the paperwork. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time and money. And you're sure this isn’t just stress? Because I'm pretty stressed right now, thanks to all this.
DOCTOR: The lab results will help us rule out other causes and determine the best course of action. And yes, stress can contribute to elevated blood pressure, but it doesn't explain the consistently high readings. Here’s the information for the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor, and the instructions for monitoring at home. Please call the office if you have any questions. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. .
