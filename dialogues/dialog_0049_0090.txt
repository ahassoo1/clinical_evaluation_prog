DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I’m here for a check-up before a surgery? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t recall all the details. Something about wanting to… improve my appearance? It was my late husband’s wish, actually.
DOCTOR: A surgery... yes. Right. Well, we'll get everything straightened out. To start, can you tell me what kind of surgery you're referring to?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I truly don’t remember the specifics. It had something to do with… my face, I think? Perhaps lifting? Or… smoothing? It was discussed with a specialist a while back, but everything is a bit hazy. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Brightful. These things happen. We can review your records. Let me pull up your file here... Ah, yes. It appears you had a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, a plastic surgeon, regarding a facelift and abdominoplasty. Does that sound… familiar?
PATIENT: A facelift… and an abdominoplasty? Yes… yes, that does ring a bell. Dr. Ramirez… a very kind man. My husband and I met with him last year, I believe. He showed us… pictures. It all seemed very sensible at the time. Though, truthfully, I’m still processing everything. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’re here today for a pre-operative check-up, to ensure you’re healthy enough for the procedures. Now, let's go through some questions to get a clearer picture of your current health status. First, have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant illnesses… Not that I can recall, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. A few colds, of course, and a bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing… serious. I did have a minor injury to my wrist a while ago, but it healed completely. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be more precise. My husband always handled the medical appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major illnesses. That's good. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I believe I had some wisdom teeth pulled in my early twenties. Other than that… no, I don’t recall any other surgical procedures. Is that helpful, Doctor? I really am trying to remember, but it’s proving quite difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It's alright, Ms. Brightful. We'll get through this. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some issues with his heart later in life. I'm not certain of the specifics, though. We weren't very close, and medical details weren't often discussed. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, lived to a very old age, quite healthy, as far as I know. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I apologize for my lack of clarity. It feels like a distant memory.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll note that. Hypertension in your mother, possible heart issues in your father. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had any issues with medications. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. I did have a slight rash once from a particular brand of lotion, but it wasn’t a serious allergy, just a mild irritation. Is that the sort of thing you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, Doctor. I’m not taking any medications at the moment. I used to take a multivitamin occasionally, but I haven’t been very diligent about it lately. I prefer to get my nutrients from food, when possible. I don’t take any supplements or anything else, no. I’ve always tried to maintain a healthy lifestyle, though it’s been difficult since… since my husband passed away.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, before we proceed, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. No, not at all. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I never cared for alcohol myself. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always believed in living a clean and healthy life. It’s a principle I’ve always held dear. This is… a bit personal, isn’t it? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Brightful. Nothing to apologize for. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as I mentioned, my husband and I used to be very active. We loved gardening, walking in the countryside… it was our passion. Since he passed away, things have been… different. I still try to get out and walk when I can, but it’s not the same without him. I spend a lot of time at home, tending to the garden… it keeps me busy. I don't really have many hobbies beyond that, I’m afraid. It’s a quiet life. I enjoy reading, and I try to stay involved in the local community whenever possible. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. That will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your general physical condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand it’s necessary. Though, I must confess, I do get a bit anxious during medical examinations. But I’ll try my best to remain calm.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you'll just have a seat here, and loosen your clothing a bit. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, we'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but breathing sounds a little shallow. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. BMI is 36.6, indicating obesity. Alright. Everything seems generally stable, but we'll want to get some baseline lab work done to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh dear. BMI of 36.6… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? I haven’t been as diligent with my diet since… well, since my husband passed away. I do enjoy my cooking, and I suppose I’ve been indulging a bit. As for the blood pressure and heart rate, could that be due to anxiety, Doctor? I do get quite nervous during these examinations. And I suppose I haven’t been as active as I used to be. But lab work sounds sensible. What sort of tests are you thinking of, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's understandable, Ms. Brightful. Anxiety can definitely contribute to elevated blood pressure and heart rate. And a sedentary lifestyle, combined with dietary changes, can contribute to weight gain. We'll run a standard CBC, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid panel. These will give us a good baseline assessment of your overall health. We’ll also check your hemoglobin A1c to screen for diabetes, given your BMI. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. All those tests… a bit daunting, but I understand it’s necessary. I trust your judgment completely. A CBC, metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid panel… and something about hemoglobin? Is that to check for sugar levels? I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, I must confess. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, please proceed. And how long will it take to get the results? I’m rather anxious to know where I stand.
DOCTOR: Yes, the hemoglobin A1c checks your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. It’s a good way to screen for diabetes, as you said. And yes, it’s good to identify those things early. The results usually take about 3-5 business days. We'll call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral for a cardiology consultation, just to get their opinion on your slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate, and get a baseline EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A cardiology consultation? Oh dear. Is it something serious, Doctor? I do get palpitations from time to time, but I always assumed it was just anxiety. Is it possible my heart isn’t as strong as it used to be? I do worry about my health, you see. It’s just… since my husband passed away, I haven't been taking care of myself as well as I should. But yes, a cardiology consultation sounds sensible. If you think it’s necessary, please proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please tell me honestly if there’s anything serious to be concerned about.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Brightful. A cardiology consultation is simply a precaution, given your blood pressure and heart rate, and the palpitations you mentioned. It’s always best to be thorough. They’ll be able to perform an EKG and other tests to get a more detailed assessment of your heart health. I want to assure you, we’re being proactive here. Often, these things are easily managed. I will also write you a prescription for a low dose beta-blocker to help with the blood pressure and palpitations while you wait for your cardiology appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A beta-blocker… to help with the blood pressure and palpitations. Yes, that sounds… reassuring, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It eases my anxiety considerably. And yes, I’m happy to proceed with the cardiology consultation. If you think it's best, Doctor, I trust your judgment completely. Thank you for being so kind and understanding. I truly appreciate your help. And what about the lab work? Do I need to fast before those tests? And where will I go to have those done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I'm glad I could ease your anxiety. As for the lab work, yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. You can go to the lab at St. Jude’s Hospital – it’s just down the road, at 123 Main Street. I will print out a lab requisition for you now. It will have all the necessary instructions. Also, I will have my nurse call you in the next day or two to schedule the cardiology appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: St. Jude’s Hospital… 123 Main Street. Yes, I know where that is. And fasting for 12 hours… that shouldn’t be too difficult. Although, I do enjoy my breakfast. But it’s a small price to pay for good health. And I appreciate the nurse calling to schedule the cardiology appointment. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at this time, Doctor. You’ve been incredibly thorough and patient with me. Thank you again for everything. I feel much more reassured now. Perhaps… perhaps I should focus on getting a good night's sleep and try to eat a healthier breakfast tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a wonderful idea, Ms. Brightful. Focus on getting some rest and making small, positive changes. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. If you think of any other questions, don't hesitate to call the office. I’ll see you back here in a week to discuss the lab results and make a plan moving forward. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Nestingen. I truly appreciate your kindness and support. I will certainly take your advice and focus on getting some rest and making healthier choices. And I will be sure to call if I have any questions. Have a wonderful day as well, Doctor. . .
