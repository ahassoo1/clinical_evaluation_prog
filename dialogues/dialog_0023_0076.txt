DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re really red and… painful, you know? Especially when I’m walking around. It’s been bothering me for a couple of weeks now.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, you say. And primarily on the shins. Painful – can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… achy. And hot. If I touch them, it kinda stings. It’s worse after I’ve been on my feet all day, working. I do a lot of moving things around at the warehouse, you see. Not heavy lifting, but a lot of walking. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Achy, hot, stinging to the touch… worse with activity. Yes, that’s helpful. And this is primarily occurring while you're working, or does it develop after you've finished your shift?
PATIENT: It starts while I’m working, I think. Like, I’ll notice my shins getting a little sore, then the bumps start showing up. And they get worse as the day goes on. When I sit down and rest, it calms down a bit, but they don’t really go away, you know? They're still red and tender. I just try to ignore it as best I can, but it's getting harder.
DOCTOR: "Ignore it," you say. Well, that’s generally not advisable. Let’s have a look at these bumps, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That’s why I’m here, right? Here they are. You can see… they’re kinda all over. I tried putting some lotion on them, but it didn’t really help.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Raised, erythematous nodules… some with slight central puncta. Are these itchy at all?
PATIENT: Itchy? Not really, Doctor. Not itchy at all, no. Just… sore and hot. Like a really bad bruise, almost. I haven’t noticed any pus or anything coming from them, if that’s what you mean. Just red bumps that hurt when I walk. My wife, she said they look kinda angry. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: “Angry” is not a medical term, Mr. Aluia, but I understand your wife is concerned. No purulent drainage, good. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other systemic symptoms along with these bumps?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. I feel fine otherwise. Just tired, you know? But that's just from work, I think. I haven't noticed anything else. I sleep okay, eat okay… everything’s pretty normal except for these… things on my legs. I just want them to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your description and the physical exam, it appears to be stasis dermatitis, possibly with some secondary inflammation. Your age and, shall we say, vascular history make that a likely possibility. But we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order a CBC and a CMP just to be thorough. And an ABI – Ankle-Brachial Index – to assess your circulation.
PATIENT: Okay… a CBC and… what was the other one? A CMP? And an… A-B-I? Doctor, I don’t know much about these tests. What are they for exactly? And will they hurt? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, the CBC – Complete Blood Count – just checks your overall blood health. Looks for signs of infection or inflammation. The CMP – Comprehensive Metabolic Panel – checks your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance… basic things. As for the ABI, it’s a non-invasive test. I’ll measure your blood pressure at your ankle and your wrist, that’s it. No needles involved for that one. It helps me check the blood flow in your legs. Standard procedure, really. We're just being cautious. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles for the A-B-I, that’s good. And just blood work for the other one? That’s alright, I guess. I haven’t had blood work in a long time, but… okay. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again? I have to get back to work, you see.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you with the results as soon as they’re available. Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment. We’ll discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Depending on the findings, this may involve compression stockings, topical steroids, or further investigation. Let's get the bloodwork ordered, and then we'll schedule that follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds alright. Compression stockings… those are like bandages, right? My wife used to wear them sometimes. I don’t know if I’d like those much. But I trust you, Doctor. Just… not too many needles, please. And thank you for seeing me. I appreciate it. Let's get the bloodwork done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: They are not bandages, Mr. Aluia. They're graduated compression hosiery. A very different thing. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the right. My nurse, Maria, will be out shortly to draw your blood. She’s very efficient. I’ll see you at your follow-up. And to reiterate, we are taking precautions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, okay… hosiery. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go find the lab. And thank Maria for being efficient. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You too, Mr. Aluia.
