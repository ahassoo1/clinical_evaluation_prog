DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s like this... my daughter, she thinks I need... a little pick-me-up. She says I should get a card. From you. A “get well” card, or… encouragement, she said. I feel fine, you understand. Perfectly fine. But she worries. Women. Always worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to be so attentive to your well-being. It’s quite common for family members to encourage check-ups, even when we're feeling alright. And it’s perfectly reasonable for her to want to ensure you’re in good health. Just to be thorough – and to perhaps reassure her – would you mind telling me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health lately?
PATIENT: Going on? Nothing is going on. I told you, I feel alright! I work, you know? Boilers. Big machines. Keep the buildings warm. Takes strength. Not something a sick man does. I haven’t been sick a day in my life, practically. Except for that flu… back in ‘98, maybe? But that’s… ancient history. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is making a mountain out of a molehill. She always does.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Mr. Kammer. It's good to hear you’re feeling strong and able to work. And it’s certainly positive that you haven’t experienced significant illness recently, aside from that flu back in ’98. Sometimes, even when we feel perfectly well, a routine check-up can help us identify potential issues early on. Just to get a complete picture, would you mind if I asked a few questions about your overall health history?
PATIENT: History? What kind of history? Like… my life story? Doctor, I came for a card. Not a biography session. Look, I’ve been doing this boiler job for thirty years. Thirty years! I know my body. It’s a well-oiled machine, just like those boilers. I don’t need you to ask me if I’ve had… I don't know… the measles or something. It's a waste of both our time, frankly. Is this card going to happen or not? My daughter is expecting it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. I assure you, I’m not trying to pry into your life story. A brief medical history simply helps me understand your baseline health and ensures I can provide the best possible care, even if everything seems perfectly fine. It’s a standard part of a check-up, and it allows me to rule out any potential concerns. Perhaps we can approach it this way: I’ll ask a few quick questions about any past illnesses, surgeries, or medications you've taken. Then, if everything checks out, we can certainly discuss what your daughter had in mind regarding a note or card. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I have things to do. And don't expect a long list. Like I said, I haven’t been sick. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. That's it. And I took some… something for my knee once. Years ago. A little ache, that's all. No big deal. Just… get to the card, Doctor. My daughter will be very pleased. And then, hopefully, she'll stop worrying about me.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils out as a child, and some medication for a knee ache in the past. That's helpful, thank you. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your tonsils?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I told you, I’m a strong man! Why would I be in a hospital? I fix things, I don't need fixing. Look, are you writing all this down? Because it's all very simple. Healthy. Strong. No problems. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is… well, never mind. Just the card. Please. A nice, encouraging card. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. You’ve made it very clear you’re in excellent health, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Just a few more quick questions, then we can move on. Have you ever had any serious injuries – a broken bone, perhaps, or a concussion?
PATIENT: Injuries? I work with machinery, Doctor. A few scrapes, a few bruises. Nothing a little bandage couldn’t fix. Nothing serious. A twisted ankle once, falling off a ladder. But I walked it off. I didn't need a hospital, or a doctor. And no… no concussions. I'm careful. You have to be careful when you work with boilers. It’s dangerous work. Are we getting anywhere with this card yet? This is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine!
DOCTOR: Alright, no serious injuries or concussions. And you’ve mentioned feeling perfectly fine. That’s excellent to hear. Now, just to complete the history, could you tell me a little about your family’s health?
PATIENT: Family health? You want to know about my mother and father? What does that have to do with anything? They’re… gone. Both of them. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. And my father… he worked too hard. That’s all I know. They didn't go to doctors much. Old-fashioned people. They believed in toughing it out. Look, Doctor, I really don’t think this is relevant. I came for a card. A simple, encouraging card. Are you deliberately trying to waste my time?
DOCTOR: I apologize for bringing up a difficult topic, Mr. Kammer. I didn't realize it would be so painful to discuss your parents. You are right, it doesn't necessarily change anything, and it was insensitive of me to ask without considering that. We can absolutely skip that part. It seems clear you are a very resilient and healthy individual. Just one final quick question, if you don’t mind. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I told you, I don’t need anything. I eat well, I work hard, and I sleep enough. That’s all. No pills, no powders, no potions. Just… a normal life. Look, can we please, please get to the card? My daughter is going to think I’m deliberately trying to avoid her if I don’t come home with something soon. This is starting to feel like a… a test. And I don't like tests. Just the card, Doctor. That's all I ask. A simple, encouraging card. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer, that’s not too much to ask at all. And I apologize again for taking so long. It seems clear you’re in excellent health, and I appreciate you sharing your information with me. Before we write the card, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Listen to my heart? Blood pressure? Now you want to examine me? After all this talk about how healthy I am? This is… this is insulting. I came for a card. Not a physical. I told you, I feel perfectly fine! I'm leaving. I think I’ll just go home and tell my daughter I tried, but you were… too busy asking questions to actually help me. This has been a complete waste of my time. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, please, don't go. I understand your frustration, and I truly apologize if I’ve upset you. A quick check of your vital signs – just your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs – is a standard part of any check-up, even if you’re feeling perfectly healthy. It takes less than a minute, and it would simply provide me with a baseline for your health record. It’s not about doubting you, it's about ensuring I can provide the best possible care. And, of course, we can skip it if you truly prefer, but I would feel more comfortable if we did it. If it will truly upset you, we can skip the physical exam and I can absolutely write the encouraging card for your daughter right now. But I do want to make sure everything is alright, even if it’s just to reassure you. What do you say?
