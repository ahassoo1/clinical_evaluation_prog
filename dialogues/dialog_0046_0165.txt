DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Clide is fine. Look, I ain't got a whole lot of time, so I'll get straight to it. Been gettin' fevers. Keep comin' back, ya know? It's… annoying, mostly. Happened a few times now over the last month or so.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. I understand you’re experiencing recurring fevers over the past month. “Annoying” is a good way to put it – it certainly can be disruptive. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. When you say they "keep coming back," could you tell me how often these fevers occur?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not on any kinda schedule, not really. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes it's been longer, like ten days. It’s hard to say for sure. They just happen. Usually in the afternoon, I think. Now, is this gonna be a long thing, Doctor? My wife is expectin' me back to help with the garden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the timing, and wanting to get back to help with the garden. We'll do our best to be efficient. “Happening” without a clear pattern is helpful information. When the fever occurs, do you experience any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I get kinda tired. Real tired. And achy. Like I’ve been workin' in the fields all day, even when I haven’t. No cough or nothin’ like that, just… worn out. And thirsty. Gotta have a lot of water when it hits. And sometimes a little bit of a headache. Not a bad one, just… there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Clide. Fatigue, body aches, thirst, and a mild headache accompanying the fever – that gives us a clearer picture. Now, regarding the fever itself, have you been taking your temperature?
PATIENT: Yeah, I got one of those digital ones. When it gets bad, it’s usually around 101, 102. Sometimes a little higher, but not usually much. I try to take something for it, ya know, Tylenol. Brings it down for a bit, but it always comes back. I don’t like takin’ pills if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a temperature between 101 and 102 Fahrenheit, and Tylenol provides some temporary relief. I appreciate you letting me know you prefer to avoid medication when possible. To help me understand a bit more about what might be going on, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' major. My back's been botherin' me for years, that’s why I see a chiropractor. Helps keep me movin’. And I got high blood pressure, the doctor put me on somethin’ for that a while back. Don’t remember the name, though. That’s about it, really. And I’m married, if that matters. My wife, Elena, she worries somethin’ awful when I get sick.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Clide. It’s good to know about the back pain and the high blood pressure. And it's very sweet that you mentioned Elena – it’s helpful to know you have a support system. Just to confirm, you are currently taking medication for your high blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, I am. Little white pill. Take it every mornin'. Now, are you gonna ask me a million questions, Doctor? I really gotta get back. Elena needs help with the tomatoes. They're comin' in fast.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Clide, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture, then we can discuss a plan. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife tries to get me to eat more fruits and vegetables, but I ain’t much of a fruit guy, to be honest. No hives, no trouble breathin’, nothin’ like that. Just… a picky eater. Now, can we wrap this up soon? My back's startin' to ache just sittin' here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. To finish up with the history, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Always try to avoid that if I can. I figure if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Elena almost talked me into gettin' my knees done a few years back, but I said no. Too risky, I thought. Now, are we almost there? I can feel the tomatoes judgin' me.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid surgery, Clide. No surgeries in the past – that’s helpful. And yes, we're almost there. One last quick question, and then we’ll move onto a physical exam, if you’re agreeable, and discuss a plan. Could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. That's a long one. My mother, she had… diabetes, I think. And my father, he had heart trouble. Lots of heart trouble. My brother, he's got high blood pressure too, just like me. Mostly just old people stuff, ya know? Lots of aches and pains. Now, can we please get to the exam? These tomatoes are gonna take over the garden if I don't get back soon. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. We'll move onto the physical exam. It will just take a few moments. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll take your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse again to confirm what you've been telling me. Finally, I'll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
