DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's these bumps on my legs, see? On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda…sore. Not always, but they get that way, especially if I've been on my feet a lot. I work, you know, moving stuff around – not easy work. It’s been happening for a little while now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bumps on your shins, you say. And they get more sore with activity?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. More sore when I'm working. Like, after a long day, they really ache. And they look…well, angry, I guess is the word. Red and kinda raised. My wife, she noticed them first, actually. She keeps telling me to get 'em checked out. She's a good woman, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think…It's hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? Or a little more? It started slow, just a little irritation, I thought. I figured it was just from the work. But they’ve gotten bigger and more noticeable lately. It's not a sudden thing, just…gradual. It’s just getting annoying now, you know?
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not really. No fever, no chills. They don't itch, thankfully. Just…soreness. Sometimes my legs feel a little tired at the end of the day, but I mean, I am an old man, Doctor! That comes with the territory, I think. Nothing else really. They haven’t changed much besides getting a bit bigger, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever had anything like this before?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. These are new. I've had my share of bumps and bruises from work, of course, but nothing like these. Not red and…hard, you know? Usually just a regular bruise fades away. These…they just stick around and get angry looking. That’s why my wife told me to come in. She says it’s not normal.
DOCTOR: And what about any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, I got high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for that, every day. And my knees, they bother me sometimes, arthritis. But other than that… nothing major. Oh, and I have Medicare, of course. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Medicare is fine. And you said a pill for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yep, one little pill, every morning with my coffee. Been taking it for…oh, must be ten years now. Keeps things steady, the doctor says. I try to eat okay too, mostly rice and fish. My wife cooks good. She always makes sure I’m taking my pill, she's very organized. Sometimes she reminds me too much, but that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. They give me shots at the clinic sometimes, for the flu and such, and I’m fine. My wife always tells them I have no allergies, she remembers everything. I always forget. But no, no allergies, Doctor. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s take a look at these bumps. If you don’t mind. Could you please pull up your pants legs a bit, so I can get a better look?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here you go, Doctor. They're mostly on the front, like I said. See? And they're kinda hard, feel 'em. Not like a soft bruise, you know? I hope it’s not anything serious. I need to keep working, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. They are firm, and slightly tender to the touch. There's some discoloration as well, a bit of brownish staining around the edges. No warmth or drainage, which is good. They're about… half an inch to an inch in size, scattered mostly on the anterior shins. It could be several things, honestly. It's not immediately alarming, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. Do you spend a lot of time kneeling, or putting pressure on your shins at work?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mostly lift and move things, stack boxes. Standing and walking a lot, that's the main thing. Sometimes I bump my shins on things, of course, but it’s not like I'm kneeling or anything. The floor is pretty smooth, too, mostly concrete. I wear work boots, too, sturdy ones. I haven't changed anything about my work routine lately. It’s been the same for years.
DOCTOR: Alright. It could be stasis dermatitis, given your age and the fact you mentioned high blood pressure. It’s common with poor circulation. It’s usually not serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Or it could be something else, like a reaction to something you're coming into contact with at work. To be on the safe side, I’m going to order a few blood tests. We need to check your circulation and rule out any other underlying issues. I also want you to elevate your legs whenever you can, especially after work. And try to avoid standing for long periods of time if possible. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Okay. Sounds…thorough. Elevate my legs… I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear that, she’s always telling me to rest more. Um…will the tests take long? And…what if it is the circulation? What happens then? Is it something serious? I just hope it doesn’t keep me from working. I need to earn a living, you know?
DOCTOR: The blood tests are fairly routine, and shouldn’t take too long. The lab results usually come back in a few days. As for what happens if it is circulation…it’s rarely serious, usually manageable. We might recommend compression stockings to help with blood flow, and we’d certainly want to keep your blood pressure under control. We may need to refer you to a vascular specialist for further evaluation, just to be sure. Look, Mr. Aluia, it’s unlikely to keep you from working entirely. But we need to get to the bottom of this to make sure it doesn't worsen. The sooner we address it, the better. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Compression stockings…I’ve seen those. And a specialist… well, that sounds a little scary, but if it helps, I guess. So, blood tests and elevate my legs. And I'll wait for the results. And if they say I need a specialist, then I'll go. I understand, Doctor. Thank you. Where do I go for the blood tests? Is it here in the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can get the blood tests done right here in the clinic. I’m going to print out a lab requisition form for you now. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They’ll need your insurance information, which they can obtain from your chart, but you should bring your ID just in case. They're open until 5 PM today. Just take this form with you, and they'll get you taken care of. The results will be sent directly to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it. I’ll go get those tests done this afternoon. Thank you again for seeing me. I feel a little better just knowing what might be going on. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Aluia. Yes, well. Get the tests done, and we’ll go from there. Have a good day.
