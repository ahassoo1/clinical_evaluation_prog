DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh dear… what brings me in. Let me see… It’s something to do with my stomach, I believe. A rather unpleasant pain, quite low down. It comes and goes, you see, and… well, I’ve been having these episodes for a little while now. I think it’s related to… something the other doctors mentioned years ago. Something about my… system not working quite right? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly normal for memories to fade a bit. We'll figure this out together. So, you're experiencing abdominal pain, low down, that comes and goes. And you mentioned other doctors spoke to you about something with your “system” years ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. They used a… a long word, I’m afraid. Something about… lupus? Or was it SLE? It was something like that. They did a lot of tests, and I was seeing them for quite some time, but then… well, life happened, and I moved around a bit. I haven’t been to a doctor in a very long while. It feels like a very long while, anyway. The pain… it's not constant, thankfully. But when it does come, it's quite debilitating. It makes it difficult to… to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, lupus or SLE – Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That’s helpful. We’ll definitely want to review those old records. And thank you for mentioning that history; it's important. You said the pain is debilitating when it occurs. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, debilitating is a good word for it. It’s… a cramping sort of pain, deep down. And a very sharp ache, at times. It feels… as if something is twisting, almost. It's difficult to explain. And it radiates, I suppose. It doesn’t stay in one spot, it sort of spreads out across my lower abdomen. It's a very… unsettling feeling. And it makes me feel quite… weak. Is that helpful? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Glymph. You’re being very clear. “Cramping, sharp ache, twisting sensation, radiating across the lower abdomen, and weakness” – that’s all very helpful information. Does anything seem to trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed a specific trigger, no. It just seems to… come and go. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been walking for a long time, perhaps? Or after I’ve lifted something… though I try not to lift anything heavy these days. But it’s not consistent, not at all. Sometimes it happens when I haven’t done anything at all. It’s rather… unpredictable, to be honest. It's just… unpleasant. I wish I could pinpoint why it happens.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is certainly frustrating. Okay. And when you say "a long time walking," could you give me an estimate of how long that is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… perhaps… fifteen, twenty minutes? Nothing strenuous, you understand. Just a leisurely walk. I do enjoy a walk when the weather is nice. It’s not as if I’m running a marathon! But even then, sometimes it doesn't happen. Other times, it begins shortly after I return home. It’s… rather peculiar. I truly apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Ms. Glymph. It sounds like you’re describing a condition that is, in itself, variable. Fifteen to twenty minutes of walking. Okay. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… Well, I have been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, anyway. And… my joints ache sometimes. My hands, mostly. Though that could just be old age, I suppose! And… I’ve had a bit of a rash on my face recently. It comes and goes, a bit like the pain. It's not terribly noticeable, but it's there. And… I've been running a bit of a fever, perhaps? It's hard to say, I don’t check my temperature very often. Oh dear, I seem to be listing off ailments now! I apologize.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize. This is all important information. Tiredness, joint ache in your hands, a rash on your face that comes and goes, and possibly a low-grade fever. Do you recall when you first noticed the rash appearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… a few weeks, I believe. Perhaps a month? It’s difficult to say exactly. It comes and goes so quickly, and I don’t pay much attention to these things, usually. It's not terribly bothersome, just… a bit of redness on my cheeks and across the bridge of my nose. It's not raised or anything, just… discolored. And it seems to be worse after I’ve been out in the sun. Oh, and I suppose I should mention that I’ve been losing my hair a bit lately. Not in clumps, thankfully, but… more than usual in the shower. Is that… concerning? I apologize for being so long-winded.
DOCTOR: You’re not being long-winded at all. All of this is very helpful, and you're doing a wonderful job remembering everything. The rash worsening with sun exposure, and the increased hair loss… those are definitely things we need to consider, especially given your history of potential lupus or SLE. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions besides what we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia years ago, but I recovered fully. And… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young. Other than that… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. Though, as I said, I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. I take a multivitamin every day, and… that’s about it. No regular medications, thankfully. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Are you writing all of this down? I apologize if I’m repeating myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Ms. Glymph. Everything is being carefully documented. Pneumonia in the past, appendix removed, and a daily multivitamin – that’s good to know. And no regular medications. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings, children – been diagnosed with autoimmune diseases, like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… My mother had… arthritis, I believe. Though it wasn’t the rheumatoid kind, I don’t think. It was just… general aches and pains, as she got older. And my aunt… she had something… a skin condition, perhaps? It was quite rare, I recall. She was always very self-conscious about it. But other than that… I don’t believe so. My father was very healthy, as were my siblings. Though, we weren’t terribly close, so I don’t know much about their medical histories. I apologize. It’s all rather vague.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Glymph. It's common for family medical history to be a bit unclear. Arthritis in your mother and a skin condition in your aunt are helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask about a few lifestyle factors. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not at all. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’ve always been a very… sensible woman. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, thank you very much. Is that… satisfactory? I apologize if I seem… judgmental. It’s just… I’ve always lived a very clean life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly satisfactory, Ms. Glymph. And no, you don’t seem judgmental at all. A good book and a cup of tea sounds lovely. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. Though, I once had a bit of a rash after using a particular brand of hand lotion, but that could have just been a sensitivity, not an allergy. And… I’m slightly allergic to dust mites, but that’s hardly a serious allergy, is it? Just a bit of a sniffle every now and then. Otherwise, no. No allergies to speak of. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. It’s just… I’ve always been quite robust.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s excellent that you haven't had any serious allergic reactions. A sensitivity to dust mites is good to know. Okay, now I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. I apologize if I’m… taking up too much of your time. I know you have other patients to see. Just… let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. And… please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to clarify anything. I’ll do my best, though I can’t promise I’ll remember everything.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up too much of my time at all, Ms. Glymph. I want to make sure we get a thorough understanding of what’s going on. And don't worry about remembering details; that's my job. Alright, if you could please follow me over to the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll take a look at your abdomen. After that, I'll check your joints for any swelling or tenderness. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly good, Doctor. Lead the way, please. I apologize if I’m a bit unsteady on my feet. It’s this pain, you see. And… please, don’t hesitate to tell me if I need to stop. I don’t want to be a bother. And… thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It's a relief to finally be talking to someone about this.
DOCTOR: Please, take your time. And don't worry about being a bother at all. That’s what I’m here for. Now, if you could just lie back for me, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It will be cool to the touch. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… Everything sounds clear, but I’m going to listen a little longer, just to be sure.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do try to breathe deeply when I can. It helps with the… anxiety, you see. It’s just… worrying about this pain, and not knowing what it is. It’s quite unsettling. And… please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you notice anything unusual. I’d rather know, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That’s… a bit tender. On the left side, you see? It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s… uncomfortable. It’s the same area where I feel the pain most of the time. And… it feels a bit swollen, perhaps? Though, I could be imagining things. It’s just… difficult to tell. And… please, be gentle, Doctor. It’s quite sensitive.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Glymph. It’s helpful to know exactly where the tenderness is located. It does feel slightly firm there, and there's a bit of guarding, which means your muscles are tensing up to protect the area. Now, I’m going to check your joints for any swelling or tenderness. Could you bend your elbows and knees for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… a bit uncomfortable as well. My hands… they ache sometimes, you see? And my knees… they feel stiff. It’s worse in the mornings, usually. And… please, be gentle, Doctor. I don’t want to aggravate anything. It’s just… difficult to move them sometimes. It’s a bit like… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see some slight swelling in your knuckles, Ms. Glymph, and there’s a bit of tenderness when I bend them. It doesn't seem to be a significant amount of swelling, but it’s there. And you're right, your knees do feel a bit stiff, and there's some crepitus when you bend them. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I'm considering a few possibilities. Given your history of potential lupus or SLE, the fatigue, joint pain, rash, and abdominal tenderness, we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Tests, you say? What sort of tests, Doctor? Will they be painful? I do try to avoid needles if I can, you see. And… will the tests take a long time? I’m afraid I have a few commitments coming up. But… whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. I just… want to know what’s going on. I’ve been worrying about this for so long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Glymph. We’ll take things one step at a time. The tests I’m considering are blood tests. We'll check for inflammation, autoimmune markers, and a complete blood count to see if there are any abnormalities. We might also want to do a urine test, just to rule out any infection. The blood tests will involve a small needle stick, but it's usually quick and relatively painless. We'll also check your blood pressure and pulse, which doesn't involve any needles. The urine test is simply a sample of your urine. The tests should take about an hour to process, and we'll have the results back within a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a urine test. Yes, that sounds… manageable. As long as the needle stick is quick, I suppose I can tolerate it. And… a few days to get the results? That’s… reasonable. A follow-up appointment… yes, that sounds good as well. I’ll need to check my schedule, but I’m sure we can find a time that works. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a bit relieved, to be honest. Knowing that you’re taking this seriously… it means a lot. What do I do next? Do I need to change clothes? Do I need to fast before the blood tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. You don't need to change clothes for the tests. However, you will need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We'll schedule the blood draw for first thing in the morning to make that easier. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and she'll give you instructions for the urine sample. After that, you're free to go. We'll call you as soon as the results are available, to schedule your follow-up appointment. Does that all sound good?
PATIENT: Eight hours fasting… and no drinks except water. First thing in the morning. Yes, that sounds… manageable. I’ll make sure to arrange my schedule accordingly. And the nurse will explain the urine sample… excellent. Yes, that all sounds good, Doctor. Thank you again. Thank you for everything. I… I think I’m ready when you’re ready. Just… please, let me know if there’s anything else I need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. The nurse will be in shortly. Just relax, and try not to worry. It'll be over before you know it. In the meantime, is there anything I can get you - a glass of water, perhaps?
PATIENT: A glass of water would be lovely, Doctor. Thank you very much. My mouth feels a bit dry, now that we’ve discussed all of this. Yes, a glass of water would be perfect.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Just take your time. I'll let you know when the nurse arrives.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. .
