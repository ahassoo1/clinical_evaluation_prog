DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… right. Leander. Though, honestly, it feels like a long time since anyone’s asked. Just Leander is fine.
DOCTOR: Very well, Leander. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Not painful, just… plugged. It’s been happening for a bit now, I think. A week? Maybe longer. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: A week, perhaps longer… Right. And has this fullness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go, I think. More often than not, it’s there, but… sometimes it feels a little better. Not gone, just… less noticeable. It’s hard to explain. Everything sounds a bit muffled, too.
DOCTOR: Muffled, you say. Any dizziness or ringing in the ears along with that?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady sometimes, but I put that down to… well, getting older, mostly. And ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little? It's faint. I mostly notice it when it’s quiet. I don’t usually pay it much mind, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Don’t pay it much mind…” Right. And have you tried anything to clear it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… tilting my head, blowing my nose. Nothing really works for long. I tried some… drops, a few years back, for something else. But I don't remember if they helped, or even what they were for. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Let's have a look. Please sit up straight and let me take a look in your ears. It's likely just wax, but we need to rule out anything more… concerning.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind. I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there's a significant amount of cerumen impacted in both ears, as I suspected. Yes, both are quite blocked. Nothing alarming visible, thankfully. It's likely this is the cause of your symptoms. A simple wax removal should resolve the issue.
PATIENT: Wax, huh? That's… good, I guess? As long as it's not something serious. So, you can just… get it out? Will it hurt? I don't like things poking around in my ears.
DOCTOR: We can remove it. It's a fairly straightforward procedure. We have a few options. We can try irrigation – flushing it out with warm water. Or, if that doesn't work, I can use a small instrument to gently remove it. It shouldn't be painful, but you may feel some pressure or discomfort. It’s hardly the worst thing, frankly. Do you have any history of ear infections or a perforated eardrum?
PATIENT: Ear infections… I think when I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. My mother… she always took care of things. I don't recall having a perforated eardrum. No, definitely not. And I don't think I've ever had any surgery on my ears. Honestly, I’m just not very good at remembering these things. Which one do you think is best? The… flushing? Sounds less scary.
DOCTOR: Irrigation it is, then. It’s the least invasive. We’ll start with that, and if it doesn't work, we’ll discuss other options. Please lean your head forward slightly. I’ll use a syringe with warm water. It may be a little uncomfortable, but try to remain still.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… let me know if it's going to be really bad, alright? I don't handle discomfort very well these days. And could you… maybe tell me what you're doing as you go? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: I'm gently flushing your ear canal with warm water. This will help to soften and dislodge the wax. Hmm. Not much coming out. Still very impacted. It appears this is going to require manual removal. It’s not ideal, but necessary. We’ll use a small instrument – a curette – to carefully remove the wax. I’ll use a microscope to ensure I don't damage your ear canal. This will take a few minutes. Please try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Manual… that sounds worse. Are you sure? It just… I don’t like things poking around in there. Is there anything else we could try? Maybe… leave it for a bit and see if it comes out on its own? I really don’t want anything… broken.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, leaving it will likely only make the problem worse, and cause further discomfort. It’s not going to “come out on its own”. We’ve established that irrigation isn’t effective. This is a standard procedure, and I assure you, I am quite capable. If you continue to be… apprehensive, I can refer you to an ENT specialist, but be aware that waiting times can be considerable. We can finish this now, or we can waste further time and potentially cause you more stress. Just try to remain still.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Alright, just… do it quickly, please. And tell me if it’s going to hurt. Just… warn me. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: A little pressure… that’s all. Just try to breathe deeply. There we go. And another piece. Alright. I believe that’s the majority of it removed. Yes, significantly improved. Your ear canals are now clear. We'll want to monitor this, to ensure the wax doesn't build up again too rapidly. I'll give you a prescription for some ear drops to help keep the wax softened. Avoid using cotton swabs, as they only push the wax further in.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. That… that’s good to hear. Ear drops, right? And no cotton swabs. I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. That was… less awful than I expected. I appreciate you getting it done quickly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really should be going.
DOCTOR: Very well. Follow the instructions on the prescription carefully. And if you experience any pain, bleeding, or dizziness, contact the clinic immediately. That will be all. Have a… pleasant day. .
PATIENT: Right. Thank you again. I will. .
