DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, you said? Yes, well, it’s… it’s my waterworks. They bother me. A lot. Keeps happening, you see. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been a while now. It's quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wease. “Waterworks” – are you referring to issues with urination?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it. Urination. Fancy word. It just... burns when I go, mostly. And I feel like I need to go all the time, even when I just went. It's very unpleasant. Honestly, I just want it to stop. I don’t recall having this problem before, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Burning with urination and feeling the frequent urge to go, even shortly after emptying your bladder, can certainly be disruptive and uncomfortable. We'll try to figure out what's causing this. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about the urine itself?
PATIENT: The urine? Oh… well, it looks normal, I suppose. You know, the usual color. Maybe a little… darker sometimes? But nothing terribly different. I don’t… I don’t really check it, if that makes sense. I just go. Is there something I should be looking for? I'm sorry, I don’t know much about this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. Don’t worry about knowing medical details – that’s what I’m here for. Darker urine can sometimes indicate dehydration, but it can also be due to other things. Now, besides the burning and frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Hmmm. Sometimes my lower tummy feels… a bit achy? Not a sharp pain, more like a dull pressure. And… oh! Yes, sometimes I feel a bit tired, but that could be anything, really. I am getting older, you know. I don’t know if that’s related. I really can't pinpoint anything else specific, Doctor. It's just… a general feeling of being unwell when this waterworks thing is acting up.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull lower abdominal discomfort and fatigue along with the burning and frequent urination. That gives me a bit more to work with. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… That’s a bit difficult. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course. My ex-husband used to drag me to them. I… I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I had a touch of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but that's all I can recall. I'm not insured, so I haven't been to a doctor regularly. I mostly just try to tough things out, you know? Does that make sense? I truly don’t remember any diagnoses, Doctor. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Wease. Many people don’t have regular access to healthcare, and it can be difficult to remember details from past visits. No need to apologize. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago. And… I think I had my appendix removed once? But it was so long ago, and I was quite young. Honestly, my memory is just… a fog, Doctor. Everything seems so distant. I don’t recall any other surgeries or being in the hospital as an adult. I hope that’s helpful. Is there something specific you're looking for? Perhaps you could ask me about something else?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Tonsillectomy and appendectomy in the past. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh my. That's a tricky one. My mother... she had a weak heart, I think. She wasn't very strong. And my father… he was a smoker. A very heavy smoker. I don’t recall any other major illnesses in the family, to be honest. They are both gone now, a long time ago. I wasn't very close to my family, so I don't really know much about their medical history. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful. This is all so… distant, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Wease. You've shared what you can remember, and that’s what’s important. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked. Not once. My father did, as I said, but I always found it… dreadful. Terrible habit. I always told him so. And I don't drink much either, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and fish, but… sometimes I just don't have the energy to cook properly. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I am trying to be as helpful as I can, even if my memory fails me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Wease. No smoking, limited alcohol, and a generally healthy diet. Finally, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, I eat nuts, I've never had trouble with any medications. I don't use any fancy creams or lotions, just simple soap. Honestly, I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard. I don’t have any known allergies, Doctor. Perhaps it's time to move on to an examination? I'm getting a bit tired, and I'm starting to forget what we've already discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief pelvic exam to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but I will explain everything as I go. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A… an examination? Well. I suppose. If you think it's necessary. But please be gentle, Doctor. I haven't had one in… well, a very long time. And do explain everything, as you said. I get nervous easily, and I truly don't remember how these things are done. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Just tell me what you need me to do, and I’ll try my best. I just want this waterworks problem to be over with, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain each step before I do it. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to perform a brief pelvic exam. I'll need you to lie on the examination table with your feet in the stirrups. I’ll use a speculum to gently visualize your cervix and vaginal walls. This may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Stirrups? It's been… a very long time since I've been in stirrups. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. But please be quick, and gentle, as you said. And do tell me what you are doing, as you go. I don't want any surprises. Just… let me know when you're ready. I'm a bit… apprehensive, if I'm being honest. This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I understand your apprehension, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I will explain each step before I do it, and you can tell me to stop at any time. First, I’m going to visually inspect the external genitalia. Everything appears normal externally. Now, I’m going to gently insert the speculum. This may feel a bit cold and uncomfortable for a moment. I see some mild redness of the vaginal walls, but no obvious lesions or abnormalities. Your cervix appears normal. I’m going to perform a gentle bimanual exam to check your uterus and ovaries. Your uterus feels normal in size and position, and your ovaries are non-tender. There is no significant pain with palpation. Overall, the exam is relatively normal, but the redness could indicate some inflammation. That concludes the exam. You did very well. I will need to send a urine sample to the lab to rule out a urinary tract infection. Would you be able to provide that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness it's over. A urine sample? Yes, yes, I can do that. Where… where should I go? And is there anything special I need to do? I always get confused with these things. Just tell me what I need to do, Doctor, and I’ll try my best. I’m just relieved the examination is finished. Honestly, it was quite… traumatic. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. I appreciate your gentle touch, though. And your explanations. It made it a little less frightening. Now, about that sample…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. I’m glad I could make it a little easier. There's a private restroom just down the hall. I'll provide you with a sterile cup. It's very important to collect a “clean catch” sample, which means you need to clean the area before you urinate. I have detailed instructions here, but basically, you’ll use the provided wipes to clean from front to back, then start urinating into the toilet, and then collect the sample midstream – about an inch or two into the stream. Then, you can finish urinating into the toilet. It's important not to touch the inside of the cup. Once you’ve collected the sample, please bring it back to me, and I’ll send it to the lab. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results. While we wait for those results, I'm going to discuss some potential causes and a plan of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A "clean catch"... It sounds complicated. Midstream? And not touch the cup? I’m afraid I might mess it up. But... I’ll try my best. Honestly, all of this is rather overwhelming. Yes, a plan of action sounds good. I just want this waterworks problem to be over with. I don't want to keep running to the bathroom all the time. Do you think it could be something serious, Doctor? I worry a lot, you know. I’m always imagining the worst. Please tell me it’s nothing serious. And… just take your time explaining things. I need to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Wease. Don't worry about getting it perfect. Just do your best. If you’re not sure, you can always ask the nurse for help. And I will absolutely take my time explaining things. Based on your symptoms and the preliminary examination, the most likely cause is a urinary tract infection, or UTI. UTIs are very common, especially in women. The burning sensation and frequent urination are classic symptoms. However, we need to confirm this with the urine sample. Other possibilities, though less likely, include overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis, which is a chronic bladder inflammation. It's unlikely to be something serious, such as bladder cancer, based on your history and the absence of blood in your urine, but we always need to rule out all possibilities. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – about eight glasses of water a day – to help flush out your system. And avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. We can also discuss some over-the-counter medications, such as cranberry supplements, which may help prevent UTIs, but they are not a substitute for antibiotics if you do have an infection. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, a UTI. That sounds… unpleasant. But you said it's common? That makes me feel a little better. Cranberry supplements… yes, I’ve heard of those. But I don't want to rely on supplements, you know? I want a real solution. And you said antibiotics? If I do have an infection, will I need to take those? And what if they don't work? I worry about side effects, you know. I’m always reading about terrible side effects in the newspaper. And… this overactive bladder… what does that even mean? Is it serious? Is it something I can fix? Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting a bit overwhelmed again. This is all very complicated. Perhaps we should focus on the UTI for now? What happens if the sample doesn’t show an infection? Then what will we do? I just want this waterworks problem to be over with, you know? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask all these questions, Ms. Wease. It’s good you’re being proactive. Let’s focus on the UTI for now. If the urine sample confirms a UTI, then yes, you will need a course of antibiotics. They are usually very effective, but it’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before you run out, to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and yeast infections, but these are usually mild and can be managed. If you experience any severe side effects, such as a rash or difficulty breathing, you should stop the antibiotics immediately and contact me. If the sample doesn’t show an infection, then we need to explore other possibilities. Overactive bladder means your bladder muscles are contracting involuntarily, causing you to feel the urge to urinate frequently, even when your bladder isn’t full. It’s not usually serious, but it can be disruptive. We can try some lifestyle modifications, such as bladder training and pelvic floor exercises, to help strengthen your bladder muscles and reduce the urge to urinate. In some cases, medication may be necessary. Before we go any further, let’s focus on getting that urine sample to the lab. Once we have the results, we can develop a more targeted plan. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. We’re in this together. Now, do you feel comfortable collecting the sample, or would you like me to ask the nurse to assist you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lifestyle modifications… pelvic floor exercises… It sounds exhausting. But if it’s not serious, I suppose I can try. I think… I think I can manage the sample myself. I don’t want to bother the nurse, you know? She seems very busy. But… if I do mess it up, can I come back and ask for help? I’m just worried I won’t do it properly. And… if it is an infection, how long will the antibiotics take to work? I have a garden, you know? I can’t be spending all day in the bathroom. I need to be able to tend to my flowers. And… what if the infection keeps coming back? This is all very worrying, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Wease. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again, and that’s what we’re working towards. You can absolutely come back and ask for help if you mess up the sample. Don't worry about bothering the nurse – that’s what she’s here for. Usually, you’ll start feeling better within a day or two of starting antibiotics, but it can take a few days for the infection to completely clear. We'll prescribe an antibiotic that allows you to maintain your daily routine as much as possible. If you're still experiencing symptoms after a few days, or if they worsen, please contact me immediately. As for recurring infections, they can sometimes happen, especially in women. If you experience frequent infections, we can discuss preventative measures, such as taking a low-dose antibiotic after intercourse, or exploring other underlying causes. For now, let’s focus on getting that urine sample to the lab. Once we have the results, we can develop a more tailored plan to address your specific needs. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns or questions along the way. I’m here to help you every step of the way. Now, would you like me to walk you to the restroom, or are you comfortable going on your own?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I think I can manage on my own. But... if I need help, I’ll come and find you. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less worried now. Although, honestly, I’m still a bit nervous about that sample. But I’ll try my best. I suppose… I suppose I should go and collect it now. Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. I appreciate your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I'll be here when you get back. .
