DOCTOR: Hi Jerrel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, it’s this hand. It shakes. Been shaking for…well, a while now. Honestly, it’s a nuisance. Can we just get this sorted? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A nuisance is a good way to put it, and we’ll definitely try to figure things out as efficiently as we can. “A while now” is a bit vague, though – could you tell me roughly when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Months, maybe? It comes and goes. Look, I was a busy man, always on set, directing…making real films, not whatever they make now. I didn’t have time to notice when a little tremor started. It just…appeared. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Jerrel. “Months” is helpful. And it’s good to know it comes and goes. Does anything specifically seem to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Worse? Stress, probably. Always stress when you’re trying to get a decent performance out of these actors. Though, everything stresses me these days. Better? Nothing I've noticed, really. It just does what it wants. I used to have a steady hand for framing a shot, now…well, you see. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I can imagine that’s frustrating, especially with your line of work. So it sounds like stress is a potential trigger. And it’s not consistently present, it comes and goes. Does it happen in both hands, or just the one you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just this one. The right one. The good one, you could say. Used to be, anyway. Though, I suppose it’s not so good anymore. It’s not like I'm directing anything these days, is it? Mostly just…remembering things. Which is getting harder by the minute, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Jerrel. It's good to know it’s isolated to your right hand. And remembering things…has that been a recent development, or has that been happening for a while as well?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Everything is happening “for a while.” Honestly, Doc, are you writing a biography or something? Look, I forget where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast…little things. It's probably just old age. My wife…well, she always remembered everything. It’s different now. Can we just get back to the hand?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Jerrel. I'm just trying to get a full picture to understand what's going on. You're right, let's focus on the hand for now. Aside from the shaking, have you noticed any other changes in your right hand?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what? It feels…a little stiff sometimes. Harder to grip things, maybe. I used to be able to hold a camera steady for hours. Now? Forget about it. And sometimes it aches. A dull ache. But aches come with getting old, don’t they?
DOCTOR: They certainly do. Stiffness, difficulty gripping, and a dull ache in the right hand…okay. And is that ache constant, or does it come and go like the shaking?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I try to do something with it. You know, pick something up, tighten a screw…things I used to do without thinking. Now I have to concentrate on it. It's infuriating. Honestly, I’m a producer and director, not a…a handyman!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel. It sounds like the symptoms worsen with use. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and a brief neurological assessment, if you're comfortable with that. Just checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I suppose. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. I have…things to remember. Though, what good will poking and prodding do, anyway? It’s a tremor. Everyone knows what a tremor is.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit here for me, and I’ll start with a quick look at your hands. I see a slight tremor in your right hand, even at rest, which is what we noticed earlier. It’s a bit more pronounced with movement. I’m also going to check your reflexes and strength in both arms, and a little bit of coordination. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished in your right arm compared to your left, and your grip strength is slightly weaker on that side as well. Coordination seems a little off, but not dramatically so. It’s subtle.
PATIENT: Subtle? Everything is subtle these days. Look, what does it mean? Is it something serious? I haven’t got time for…for whatever these things require. Tests? Hospitals? I’ve seen enough hospitals in my life. Just tell me what it is and if I need to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I understand your concerns. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam I've done, the most likely possibility is essential tremor. It's a common neurological condition that causes a rhythmic shaking, usually in the hands, and it often worsens with age. It’s not usually life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood tests. These will help us to check for things like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies that could be contributing to the shaking. And I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation and possibly some additional testing, like a DaTscan, which can help confirm the diagnosis. Would you be comfortable with those steps?
PATIENT: Tests…a neurologist… Honestly, it’s always something, isn't it? Look, I suppose I have no choice. Just…get it over with. The faster this is done, the better. But don’t expect me to remember any of the details. My wife used to handle all this… Now, I’m just a nuisance. Fine. Do your tests. Just don’t keep me waiting all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I’ll get the lab order for the blood tests right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw those. And I’ll get the referral to the neurologist processed, and they’ll be in touch to schedule an appointment. It may take a few days to get everything arranged. In the meantime, if the shaking becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, like difficulty walking or changes in your speech, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Honestly, I just want to go home. Look, thanks for…whatever. Just get those tests done and send me on my way. I’ve got things to forget, I mean, remember. Yes, remember. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Jerrel. I understand. I’ll have the nurse come in to take your blood now. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
