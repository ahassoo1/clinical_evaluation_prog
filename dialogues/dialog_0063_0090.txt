DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is rather… full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a clearance appointment? To make sure I’m healthy enough. It’s… difficult to recall all the specifics, truthfully. It was discussed with another doctor, some time ago.
DOCTOR: A clearance appointment, yes. Vague recollections are… unhelpful, Ms. Brightful. It’s essential we have a clear understanding of why you need clearance. What surgery are we discussing?
PATIENT: Oh, forgive me, Doctor. It’s… a face lift. Yes, that’s right. A face lift and… possibly some work around my eyes. It’s been a long time since the consultation, and… well, my husband’s passing has left me rather… scattered. I apologize for the confusion. I remember wanting to do something… for myself, but the details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: A face lift… very well. And you wish to ensure you are a suitable candidate before proceeding. Understandable, I suppose. Though delaying things rarely improves matters. Let’s begin with your medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. My husband, he always said I had good genes. But… I did have a bout of… something with my heart a few years back. It wasn’t serious, I don’t believe. Just… palpitations. I saw a doctor about it, and they said it was likely stress. Is that… helpful? I’m so sorry, I wish I could remember the details. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Palpitations… “likely stress.” Right. Vague, as expected. Were any tests performed?
PATIENT: I… honestly can’t recall, Doctor. I think… maybe an EKG? But I’m really not sure. It was a very busy time, and I wasn’t really paying close attention to the specifics. I mostly just followed the doctor’s instructions, and it seemed to resolve on its own. I haven’t had any problems since, thankfully. Would my previous doctor’s records be helpful? I believe I signed a release form at some point.
DOCTOR: They would be. Though it is rather inconvenient, Ms. Brightful, to require me to piece together your history from other sources. Do you recall which doctor you saw for these palpitations?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It was… Dr. Ramirez. He was at City General Hospital. A cardiologist, I believe. I remember liking him very much. He was very patient, and explained everything so clearly. I… I think his first name was… Alejandro? Or maybe… Armando? I’m terribly sorry, my memory is just not what it used to be. I do remember the hospital, though. City General. That’s definite.
DOCTOR: City General… Ramirez… Yes, there are several doctors fitting that description. We shall see what we can uncover. In the meantime, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I haven’t needed anything, thankfully. Just a multivitamin now and then. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. My garden provides a lot of it, actually. It’s… therapeutic. Though I haven’t been keeping it up as much lately. Is that relevant? I apologize for rambling. I just… I’m trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Irrelevant. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else – food, latex, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’m weeding, but I think that’s just the plants. Or maybe the sun? I always wear a hat and sunscreen, but… I suppose it’s possible. I'm really trying to remember, Doctor. It’s just… everything feels so distant. I don’t think I have any significant allergies, though. Nothing I’m aware of, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I need to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will start with your vital signs, and then I will listen to your heart and lungs. It is standard procedure, Ms. Brightful. Though frankly, relying on recollections alone is… unsatisfactory.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I understand. I apologize again for not being more… precise. I do hope this is enough. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated – 140/90. Heart sounds are… regular, but a bit rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s briefly assess your surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I believe. And… oh! A mole removed from my back, years ago. It was a very small procedure, just a local anesthetic. Nothing major, really. And… I think that’s it. No other surgeries that I can recall, Doctor. Although, my mother always said I had a very… uneventful medical history. She was quite proud of that.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a bit difficult. My mother lived to be quite old, thankfully. I think she died peacefully in her sleep. My father… he passed away when I was young, from… I believe it was a heart condition. Something about… blocked arteries? But I wasn’t very close to him, so I don’t have many details. And I don’t know much about my grandparents either. My mother didn’t talk about them very much. Is it important to know more specifically? I truly wish I could be more helpful. I feel like I'm failing this test.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to have a more complete picture, Ms. Brightful, but we shall proceed with what we have. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the family history of heart disease, I recommend a thorough cardiac workup before proceeding with elective surgery. An EKG is a start, but we need to rule out any underlying issues. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist. We must prioritize your safety, Ms. Brightful.
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. I completely understand. Prioritizing safety is… paramount, of course. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if I haven’t been the most… cooperative patient. Could you perhaps recommend a cardiologist? Someone… gentle, perhaps? Someone who is used to dealing with… forgetful patients?
DOCTOR: Dr. Elara Vance. She is quite experienced and has a… patient demeanor. Her office is located at City General, near the oncology department. She will arrange the necessary tests. I also advise you to maintain a healthy lifestyle - diet, exercise, stress management. It is vital, Ms. Brightful. And try to recall any relevant medical information before your appointment with Dr. Vance. It will assist her in providing the best possible care. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. That’s… very helpful. Dr. Vance, City General… I’ll write that down immediately. I truly appreciate your time and patience. And your… gentle approach. It means a lot. I'm a bit overwhelmed, truthfully, but I feel… better informed now. Thank you. I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I trust you will follow up with Dr. Vance promptly. Good day, Ms. Brightful. And please, make an effort to remember details in the future. It benefits everyone involved.
