DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to figure out what’s causing it, if you can. I don't like feeling like pins and needles all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. I understand. “A little while now” – can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It comes and goes, you know? Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days… it’s really annoying. Especially at night. It wakes me up sometimes. I just thought it was getting older, to be honest. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four months, coming and going, worse at night… and it’s been disrupting your sleep. That's helpful. Can you describe the tingling itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… hard to explain. Like pins and needles, yeah, like you said. And sometimes it feels… numb? Not completely, but like… less feeling than usual. It’s mostly in my fingers and toes, but it can go up my hands and feet a little bit. It’s not pain, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. I keep wiggling my toes hoping it’ll help.
DOCTOR: Okay, pins and needles, numbness, mostly in fingers and toes, sometimes extending up the hands and feet, not pain but uncomfortable. You wiggle your toes for relief. Does anything specifically trigger it, or make it worse – certain activities, positions, times of day other than night?
PATIENT: Well… I don't know if anything specifically triggers it. I do a lot of walking for my job, delivering mail, you know? And sometimes, after a long day, it feels worse. But other days I walk just as much and I'm fine. I also notice it sometimes when I’m cold. Like, if I’m sitting and my feet get chilly, that seems to bring it on. But again, not always. It's just… random, really. It’s hard to pin down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so walking long distances can make it worse, and cold temperatures seem to be a factor, but it’s not consistent. Do you have any other symptoms that come along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. No, not really. I get tired, of course, I'm 63 and on my feet all day! But that's just normal, I think. No weakness, no dizziness, no changes in my skin color. Just the tingling. I haven't noticed anything else. Honestly, that's why I waited so long to come in. It didn’t feel like anything serious, just annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other associated symptoms like weakness, dizziness, or skin changes. Just the tingling, and fatigue which you attribute to your job. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but the doctor put me on some pills and it went down. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, to be honest. Since my husband passed. He took care of all that stuff, and… well, it just slipped my mind. Nothing major, though. I don't think I have any serious conditions. Just… getting old, probably. I haven’t had any surgeries or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication, but haven’t been to a doctor regularly in a while, and no surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He was always tired, and then one day he just… wasn’t anymore. I don't know much about their medical histories, really. They weren’t ones for talking about that kind of thing. I have a sister, but we don’t talk much anymore. I don't know what she's been up to, let alone what medical problems she has. Sorry, I'm not much help there.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We work with what we have. Arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Never had a reaction to anything. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, that's about it. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. They always make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and just vitamin D occasionally. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and reflexes, and I’ll also do a little neurological exam to check your sensation and strength in your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's going on. Let's get it over with, if you don't mind. I have mail to deliver tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Of course. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, but that’s not unexpected. Pulse is 78, regular. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems good, five out of five in all extremities. However, sensation is slightly diminished in your fingers and toes, bilaterally. Not dramatically, but noticeably less sensitivity compared to other areas. It's more pronounced in your feet. Do you notice any difference in sensation when I touch your left versus your right hand, or foot?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I think… my left foot feels… more numb? Or maybe less feeling, like you said. It’s hard to explain. The right foot feels a little more normal, but both aren’t quite right. My hands are about the same, I think, a little tingly but not a big difference between left and right. It’s definitely my feet that are worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Diminished sensation more pronounced in the left foot than the right, and both feet are more affected than your hands. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, several things could be going on. It could be peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage, often caused by things like diabetes, but you haven’t mentioned any symptoms of diabetes. It could also be caused by vitamin deficiencies, or even just compression of the nerves in your feet from wearing ill-fitting shoes. Another possibility, though less likely given your lack of other symptoms, is poor circulation. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and kidney function. I also want to do a nerve conduction study, which will measure the electrical activity in your nerves and help us determine if there is any nerve damage. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… Well, I don’t like the sound of that, but I suppose if you think it’s necessary. Nerve conduction study sounds… unpleasant. But I want to know what’s going on, so yes, I guess so. Just… please don’t make me do anything too awful. Are these tests expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the tests, and I'll do my best to make them as comfortable as possible. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin and sending a mild electrical current through your nerves. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a brief tingling sensation, but it’s not painful. Regarding cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. The blood tests will be around $150, and the nerve conduction study will be about $300. We do have a financial assistance program that may be able to help reduce the cost, and I can put you in touch with our billing department to discuss your options. We also work with a local charity that sometimes assists with medical costs for uninsured patients. We’ll start with the blood tests, and then schedule the nerve conduction study if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: $450… oh my. That’s… a lot. I really don’t have that kind of money just lying around. Financial assistance program… that sounds good. Please, put me in touch with the billing department. And yes, let’s start with the blood tests. Maybe that will tell us something before we do anything expensive. Is there anything I should do before the blood tests? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do our best to work with you on the cost. I'll have the billing department contact you directly to discuss the financial assistance program and payment options. Yes, for the blood tests, you'll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, other than water, before the test. We can schedule them for first thing in the morning, so you can eat breakfast afterward. We'll draw the blood right here in the clinic. Do you have any questions about the fasting or anything else?
PATIENT: Eight hours… that's a long time. I usually have a little something with my coffee. But alright, I can do it. Just… water only. Okay. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… when will I get the results? And will you explain them to me, or will I have to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Okay, water only for 8 hours before the test. We can schedule the blood draw for 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once I have the results, I'll review them thoroughly and contact you to discuss them. We can schedule a follow-up appointment if needed, to go over everything in detail and discuss treatment options. However, for simple results, I can often explain them over the phone, if that's easier for you. In the meantime, try to avoid wearing shoes that are too tight or put pressure on your feet. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. 8:00 AM tomorrow. No tight shoes. And I'll call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for trying to help. I hope these tests don't take too long. I have mail to deliver, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I understand you have a busy schedule, and we’ll do our best to get the tests done quickly. I'll have my nurse schedule the blood draw for you now, and she'll also give you a handout with instructions about the fasting. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Have a good evening, and get some rest.
