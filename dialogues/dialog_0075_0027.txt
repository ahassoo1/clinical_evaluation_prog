DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. Especially after I eat. It’s just… unpleasant. And frankly, a waste of my day dealing with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time and we'll be as efficient as possible. When you say “stuff coming up,” are you referring to vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No, no, not vomiting. Goodness, no. It's… more like a return trip. Food, you know? And… acid. It just bubbles up. It’s not forceful or anything, just… unwelcome. Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my wife insisted I come. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, a “return trip” of food and acid, especially after eating. Not forceful vomiting. That helps clarify things. How long has this been happening, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a while. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? It comes and goes. Worse when I eat bigger meals, naturally. I eat a good Polish dinner, you know? Big portions. My wife makes excellent food, but… well, maybe it’s too good. I don't know. It’s not like I can tell her to make less! That’d be a disaster.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months of intermittent episodes of food and acid coming back up, worse with larger meals. And you’re hesitant to change your wife’s cooking, which is perfectly understandable. Does this happen with all foods, or are there certain things that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Honestly? It seems to happen with anything rich. Sauces, fried things… anything with a bit of flavor, really. Plain boiled chicken? Not so much. But who wants to eat just boiled chicken? It’s a sad existence. Look, I’m a practical man. I need my sustenance. And I enjoy it. This whole thing is… inconvenient, is what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more common with richer, more flavorful foods, and less common with blander options like boiled chicken. And you’re experiencing this despite enjoying a good appetite. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this – heartburn, indigestion, a sour taste in your mouth, bloating, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Heartburn… sometimes. A little burning in my chest. Not terrible, I just ignore it. Sour taste? Occasionally. Mostly just the… unpleasant sensation of everything coming back up. Bloating… no, not really. I'm a fairly thin man, you can see that. Swallowing? No trouble there. I eat plenty. It's just… after. That's when things go wrong. And frankly, it's embarrassing to talk about. Can we get this over with? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and embarrassment, Mr. Altine, and we will be as efficient as possible. So, intermittent episodes of food and acid reflux, worse with rich foods, accompanied by occasional heartburn and a sour taste, but no difficulty swallowing or significant bloating. Let me ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as acid reflux, GERD, or ulcers?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Goodness, no. My father had something like that, years ago. Not fun. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, no. I just… get this. My doctor back home, he just said to take some… antacids. Which I do. When I remember. They help a little, but not always. I’m a busy man. I don’t spend much time worrying about my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses, but you’ve taken antacids occasionally with some relief. And you’ve had a family history of ulcers. Do you take any other medications regularly, aside from the antacids?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small pill, every morning. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk, I eat well… when this doesn’t happen, that is. Honestly, this whole thing is disrupting my life. I need to be sharp for my job. Emergency Management. Can't be feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for blood pressure and occasional antacids. You work in Emergency Management, and need to maintain your health. That’s good to know. Now, briefly, can you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Appendectomy when I was a boy. That’s it. Nothing else. A fairly standard operation, decades ago. No complications, as far as I recall. Honestly, I’m not one for doctors. I only come when absolutely necessary. And my wife makes me. She worries too much, I tell you. Too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in childhood, no other surgeries. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat everything. Polish food, everything. I'm a pretty resilient man. Look, are we almost done here? I really need to get going. I have reports to review and a meeting with the mayor. This is taking up a lot of my time. I appreciate your efficiency, but… frankly, this feels like a waste of a good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Thank you for that information. Okay, Mr. Altine, based on what you’ve told me – intermittent episodes of food and acid reflux, worse with richer foods, occasional heartburn, no difficulty swallowing, no allergies, and a history of an appendectomy – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It’s a common condition, often triggered by diet or lifestyle factors. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. Then we can discuss a plan for managing your symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Really? Look, I already told you I’m fine. I’m a practical man. I don't need poking and prodding. I've lived a long life, I know my body. But… fine. If you insist. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do detect some slight tenderness in your upper abdomen, where your stomach is located. No masses or guarding. That confirms what I suspected. Mild tenderness is common with GERD. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few simple tests: a blood test to rule out any underlying issues, and an upper endoscopy to examine the lining of your esophagus and stomach. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? An endoscopy? Absolutely not. Look, I’m not sticking a camera down my throat. That sounds… unpleasant. And frankly, unnecessary. I told you, I’m a practical man. I’ll just take more antacids. And maybe… maybe I’ll try to eat a little less Polish sausage. But no tests. I’m not wasting my time or money on that. This is ridiculous. Can we just write a prescription for something and be done with it? I have a city to run, you know!
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine. An endoscopy is the most definitive way to diagnose GERD and rule out any complications, such as inflammation or Barrett’s esophagus. However, I respect your wishes. Given your preference, we can try a trial of medication. I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which is a stronger medication than antacids and helps reduce stomach acid production. We’ll start with a low dose and see if that provides relief. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider the endoscopy at some point. Untreated GERD can lead to serious complications. I'm happy to discuss it further with you at a later date. I'm going to prescribe you Omeprazole, 20mg daily, for eight weeks. Take it 30 minutes before your first meal. If your symptoms don’t improve after eight weeks, or if they worsen at any time, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss further testing. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding foods that trigger your symptoms – rich, fatty, fried foods, spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and chocolate. Elevating the head of your bed by six inches can also help reduce nighttime acid reflux. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Fine. Omeprazole. Eight weeks. No sausage. I’ll try it. But frankly, I doubt it will make a difference. My wife will be pleased, I suppose. No, I don’t have any questions. This has taken up enough of my time. Just… send the prescription to my pharmacy. And thank you, Doctor. I really need to get going. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. The prescription has been sent to your pharmacy. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. And I do urge you to reconsider the endoscopy if your symptoms persist. Have a good day, and please try to manage your stress levels – that can also contribute to GERD symptoms. .
