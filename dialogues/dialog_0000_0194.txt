DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa Mayhaugh, 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my hearing, mostly. It comes and goes, you see. And sometimes… sometimes the room just spins. It’s awful. My daughter, Lani, she booked this appointment for me. She worries so. It's just… hard to explain. And my husband… he used to have something similar. Years ago now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Comes and goes, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not constant. Some days I’m fine, completely normal. Other days… well, it’s like someone turned the volume down really low, or muffled everything. And the spinning… that doesn’t happen every time, thankfully. It's just… unsettling. I don’t remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It feels like a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s been going on for a while. Let’s try to narrow things down. When you say “comes and goes,” are there any specific things that seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh dear… triggers? That's a good question. I don’t think so, not really. Or… maybe stress? Lani always says I worry too much. And sometimes it feels worse when I’m tired. But honestly, I can’t say for sure. It just… happens. I do like to go to the casino sometimes, you know? Maybe… maybe that has something to do with it? All the noise and lights…
DOCTOR: The casino, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, the casino. I enjoy a bit of a gamble, you see. Nothing serious, just… a bit of fun. But it is awfully loud in there. And bright. I don't know if it's related, but my daughter keeps saying it can't be good for me. She worries about everything, that one. She means well, though. It's just... hard to keep track of what might be causing it all. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to get a better picture of exactly what you're experiencing when your hearing changes. When it muffles, does it affect both ears equally?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Both ears… yes, I think so. Or… maybe one is a little worse than the other sometimes? It’s hard to tell. They both feel… sort of blocked. It's not like one ear goes completely silent, if that makes sense. Just… quieter. And fuzzier. Like there's cotton in them, or something. It’s hard to explain. I just know it’s not normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, both ears, muffled, feeling of fullness. And this spinning sensation… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, the spinning… It's not like I'm actually spinning, you see. It's more like… the room is moving around me. Like I’m on a boat, maybe? Or… like I’ve had a bit too much to drink, but I haven't! It makes me feel very unsteady, and a little bit sick. Sometimes I have to sit down straight away. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it’s very frightening. It’s happened a couple of times when I've been at the casino, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Right. Casino again. Well, loud noises can certainly be disruptive. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Have you had any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, nothing major, you see. I have a bit of trouble with my knees, getting old you know. And the doctor always tells me to watch my weight. But nothing serious. And I have Medicare, if that’s what you mean. My husband, he had high blood pressure, but I don’t… I don’t think I do. I haven't really kept track of things, to be honest. It's all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… and I think I had a little something done on my knee a long time ago, but it wasn't very serious. Just a little scope, I think. Nothing like a full replacement. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. It was years ago. Is this important? I just want to know what’s happening with my hearing. It's been so worrying.
DOCTOR: Tonsils, scope. Alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Just these. For my knees, mostly. And a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave me those a few months ago, just in case. I don't really pay attention to names, Lani handles all of that. She says it’s best, I just take what she gives me. Do you need to know the names? It's all a bit of a jumble. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Let's see… Ibuprofen, quite a lot of it. And… Lisinopril, a blood pressure medication. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I sometimes get a bit of a rash if I eat shellfish, but that’s just a little itch. Nothing serious. Is that important? I'm really not good with remembering things like that. It’s all a bit of a blur. I just want to know what’s happening with my ears.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history of hearing loss, dizziness, ibuprofen use, and blood pressure medication… it could be a number of things. Meniere’s disease is a possibility, but we'd need further testing to confirm that. And given your age and medication list, we'll want to rule out any side effects. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look in your ears.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Testing? What kind of testing? Will it hurt? I don’t like tests. And… Meniere’s? What’s that? That sounds scary. I just want to know what’s wrong with my ears, you see. Is it serious? Will I go deaf? I don't think I can handle a lot of tests. It all sounds very… complicated.
DOCTOR: It's a simple hearing test, and I'll just have a look in your ears, it won't be painful. Meniere’s disease can cause hearing loss and dizziness, but it's manageable with treatment. Now, please, let me examine you. If you’d rather just continue worrying, that's your prerogative, but I need to see something to determine what's going on.
