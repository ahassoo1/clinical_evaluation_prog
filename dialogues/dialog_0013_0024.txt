DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Chriselda, it’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Just confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s… for a trip. A fairly important one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fitness-to-fly letter. No problem at all, we can definitely get that sorted for you. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I can write the most accurate letter possible, can you tell me a little more about the trip?
PATIENT: It's… personal. I’m going to visit some family overseas. It’s been a long time. But honestly, the airline is just being difficult about paperwork. They need a doctor to sign off, saying I don’t have any conditions that would make flying unsafe. That’s all. It's not a complicated trip, distance-wise. About twelve hours, I think. From here to… well, it doesn't really matter where.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – airlines can be very particular about these things, and it's good you're being proactive. Twelve hours is a fairly long flight, so it is good to be sure. To get a clear picture, can you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: Well, I’m… generally okay. I try to eat healthy, though it’s hard sometimes. I walk most days, if the weather is good. I had some… complications a few years back, lost my husband suddenly, but that wasn’t a physical thing, just… difficult. Aside from that, no major illnesses, no surgeries. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, but everything's usually fine. I really don't have any health problems, honestly. That’s why this is so frustrating!
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s good to hear you’re generally healthy, and staying active is wonderful. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no trouble with medications… nothing. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. Honestly, it's… almost boring. My medical history is very uneventful.
DOCTOR: That’s great! It’s always good when things are uneventful medically. Are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't take anything. I really try to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. I get enough Vitamin D in the summer, and I try to eat foods that are rich in everything else. Is this taking long? I do have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Not at all, we’re almost done! I just need to do a quick physical exam, just to be sure everything is okay before I write the letter. It’ll just be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. The quicker the better, honestly. I just want to get this letter and be done with it. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? I used to do a lot of… well, never mind. Just let me know if I’m doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, thank you. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 122/78, which is excellent. Pulse is 72, also good. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks clear as well. Everything sounds and looks good. No obvious concerns at all.
PATIENT: That's good to hear. Really good. I was starting to worry it would be more complicated than this. So… can you write the letter now? Is there anything I need to sign?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll just need a few minutes to finalize this, and then I’ll need you to sign a brief consent form confirming the information we discussed is accurate. Here’s the letter for the airline, and this is just a quick form for our records. Take your time reviewing them.
PATIENT: Yes, looks fine. Everything seems correct. There you go. I really appreciate your help, Chriselda. It’s a weight off my mind. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Here's a copy of the letter for your records. Safe travels, and enjoy your visit with your family! If you need anything else in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. .
