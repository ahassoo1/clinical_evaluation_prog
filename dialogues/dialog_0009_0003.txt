DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have all day, you know. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. It's…annoying, really. Doesn’t hurt, just…wobbly. My wife, bless her soul, kept telling me to come in, but I figured it was just old age. She's gone now, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It's completely understandable to put things off, and it's good you're here now. “Annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe it. This shaking – when did you first notice it starting?
PATIENT: Honestly? Can’t rightly say. A while back. Months, maybe? Everything kinda blurs together after a point, you know? I was… making a drink, I think. Pouring a whiskey. That’s when I noticed it was harder to keep the bottle steady. Could be longer ago than that though. I don't spend much time thinking about it. It’s not like it’s getting worse… drastically.
DOCTOR: Okay, months ago while pouring a drink. And it hasn’t been rapidly worsening. That's helpful to know. Is it just your hand that shakes, or do you notice it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just the hand, mostly. Though…sometimes my leg feels a little…jumpy when I'm sitting for too long. But that could be anything. I always fidgeted. Always had a lot of energy, even now. Never could sit still for long. Don't know why anyone would want to sit still, honestly. It's a waste of a good life.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, primarily in your right hand, with occasional jumpiness in your leg. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It’s worse when I’m trying to do something, like, you know, button a shirt or sign my name. Stupid things like that. When I'm just sitting here, it's… calmer. Not gone, but not flapping around like a hummingbird's wings. I just want to get this over with, if we're being honest. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Baide. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. It sounds like it’s more noticeable with fine motor skills, like buttoning a shirt or writing, and less present at rest. That’s a key piece of information. Let me just take a look at your records here… I see you’ve had a fairly standard check-up history. No major neurological concerns listed. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Neurological? What's that even mean? Look, I'm 80 years old. Everything hurts! My knees, my back, my… everything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, the blue pills, I think. And something for cholesterol, the little white ones. That’s about it. I don’t go in for all that fancy doctor stuff. Never really saw the point. They just want to sell you more pills, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Baide. “Neurological” just means relating to the brain and nerves. We just want to make sure everything is working as it should. And you’re right, it’s good to keep things simple. So, you're on medication for blood pressure and cholesterol. Do you know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, names? No! I just take the pills my son orders for me. He’s a pharmacist, see? Smart boy. He puts them in those little plastic things, one for morning, one for night. I just swallow them. Don't bother me with the names, honestly. What does it matter what they call them? They’re supposed to keep me alive, that’s all I know. This is ridiculous. I'm starting to forget why I even came here. It's just a little shake, for goodness sake!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It's perfectly fine if you don't know the names of the medications. Your son being a pharmacist is very helpful. We'll try to figure this out. To get a better understanding of what might be causing the shaking, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your reflexes, coordination, and a few other things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. Reflexes? Coordination? I used to be a director, for crying out loud! I coordinated entire films! This is… insulting. But hurry up about it. Honestly. I’m losing my patience. And don’t poke me too hard. My skin is sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It won’t take long at all, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I apologize if it feels insulting; that's not my intention at all. We're just trying to gather information. Okay, Mr. Baide, just relax your arms… Good. Now, can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: There. See? Perfectly fine. A little tremor, maybe. Old age, I tell you. Old age. Don't need fancy tests for that. Now, what about this…heel thing? Honestly, this is silly. I haven’t done this since…I don’t know when. This is a waste of my time, frankly. There. Happy? I miss it. So what? It’s just a leg. People miss things. It's called getting older! .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. Thank you. I’ve noted those findings. It is common to experience some changes with age. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, the shaking could be a few things. Sometimes it’s simply what we call essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition that causes shaking, especially in the hands. It’s usually not serious, but it can be bothersome. Other possibilities, although less likely given your description, could include medication side effects or, less commonly, other neurological conditions. To rule those other possibilities out and get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. They’ll check your thyroid function and vitamin levels, and also rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
