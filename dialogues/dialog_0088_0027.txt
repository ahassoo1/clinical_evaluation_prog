DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get right to it. It’s this…stuff. Coming up. All the time. Especially after I eat. It’s just…unpleasant. And it's been happening for a good while now, you know? A few months, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be brief, and we can certainly do that. “Stuff coming up” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, what do you want to know? It’s…food. Partially digested, I suppose. And acid. It burns. It just…comes back up. Sometimes it’s after I lie down, sometimes just randomly. I eat a normal dinner – steak, potatoes, whatever – and then…blugh. It’s very inconvenient, if you must know. And frankly, embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you're experiencing regurgitation – bringing food back up, often with a burning sensation, and it’s been happening for a few months, sometimes after eating, sometimes when lying down. You mentioned it’s with “normal” dinners, like steak and potatoes. Is it everything you eat, or are certain foods worse than others?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a lecture on what I eat. It happens with most things, to be honest. Though maybe richer foods are worse…steak, yes, like I said. Chocolate, sometimes. But even something simple like… toast can do it. I don't spend my time analyzing every crumb, Doctor. It just happens. Is there a quick fix for this or not? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I'm not trying to lecture you. Knowing what foods trigger it helps us narrow down the possibilities. So, it sounds like richer foods are more likely to cause it, but even bland things like toast can sometimes trigger it. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… a fever? No. I don’t feel sick. Just… annoyed. And a bit of heartburn, sometimes. But I’m a man of… robust constitution. I don’t go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. It’s the regurgitation that’s the problem. It’s undignified. Does that answer your question? I really need to get back to my schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, just occasional heartburn along with the regurgitation. And you feel generally well otherwise. Do you happen to notice if it’s worse when you lie down flat, or perhaps after bending over?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, it is worse when I lie down. Definitely. I have to prop myself up with pillows, at least two, sometimes three. It's ridiculous. And bending over... well, I try not to. It just… forces it up, you see? I'm not a young man anymore, Doctor. Gravity is not my friend. This is hardly a surprise, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Lying down and bending over make it worse, and propping yourself up with pillows helps. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll palpate your abdomen. This will just help me rule out anything more serious. It will only take a few minutes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be comfortable. I’ve got a very important appointment this afternoon. And please be quick about it. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Honestly, a good strong antacid should be all I need. This seems like a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. Mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpated.
PATIENT: So? What does that mean? Is it serious? Am I going to need surgery? Honestly, if it’s something chronic, I don’t even want to know. I have better things to worry about than my stomach. My wife will have a field day with this. She always says I should eat less steak. This is just proving her point, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Based on the exam, there's no indication of anything acutely serious, like a blockage or peritonitis. The tenderness in your upper abdomen could be related to the regurgitation and the acid irritating your esophagus. It sounds very much like gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Essentially, the valve between your esophagus and your stomach isn't closing properly, allowing stomach acid to come back up. This can cause the regurgitation, heartburn, and discomfort you're experiencing. It's very common, especially with certain foods. We can start with some lifestyle modifications and medication. Before we get to that, do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is. A small dose. And I take a multivitamin, but that's it. Honestly, I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. And lifestyle modifications? What does that even mean? Am I supposed to live on celery and water? Tell me straight, Doctor. What am I looking at here? And how long before I can have a decent steak again?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a multivitamin. Good to know. Lifestyle modifications simply mean a few changes that can help manage the acid reflux. Things like elevating the head of your bed – you’re already doing that with the pillows, which is excellent – avoiding large meals, especially close to bedtime, and avoiding foods that trigger the reflux – things like chocolate, steak, fried foods, caffeine, alcohol. It doesn’t mean you have to give those things up entirely, but reducing them can make a big difference. We can also start you on a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, a medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It’s usually very effective. It will likely take a few days to a week to see a noticeable improvement. We can start with a low dose and see how you respond. Regarding the steak... I wouldn’t say you have to eliminate it completely. Perhaps smaller portions, less frequently, and see how you tolerate it. It’s about finding a balance. Would you be comfortable trying that approach?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I suppose I can try a few things. I'm not promising anything, though. I like my steak. And I'm not about to change my entire life for a bit of heartburn. And what’s the downside of this…pill? Will it make me sleepy? Constipated? I don’t want to be dealing with more problems. Honestly, this is all very inconvenient. Just tell me what I need to do to get this over with as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. The PPI I’m thinking of, Omeprazole, is generally well-tolerated. Some people experience mild side effects like headache or diarrhea, but these are usually temporary. It’s not likely to cause significant constipation. I’ll write you a prescription for 20mg of Omeprazole, to be taken once daily in the morning, 30 minutes before breakfast. I'll also give you a handout with information about GERD and lifestyle modifications. I recommend trying this for a month. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to consider further testing, such as an endoscopy to look at your esophagus directly. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No, I don't. Just…get me the prescription. And please, no lectures. I've wasted enough of my day on this already. Honestly, I'm going to go have a small glass of something strong just to calm my nerves. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Here you are. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, finding a balance is key. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
