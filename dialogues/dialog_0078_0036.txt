DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is... good to meet you as well. I am here for the… the check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare, you know? They said I need this before it… works. Is that correct? I do not like wasting time with paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That’s perfectly correct, Mr. Barban. It’s a standard requirement from Medicare to establish care with a primary care physician before coverage fully begins. We'll do a thorough check-up today to get a baseline of your health. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. So, to start building that picture, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall… health? What does that mean, exactly? I work. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I have a little… discomfort, but nothing serious. It is just… life. I do not understand why I need to tell you this. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Barban. When I ask about your overall health, I’m trying to understand your general well-being – things like how you feel on a typical day, what your usual energy levels are like, and if anything is interfering with your daily activities. You mentioned some discomfort, and that’s exactly what I want to hear about. It is necessary, because even seemingly minor things can give me clues about your health. Let's start with that discomfort. Where exactly are you feeling it, and can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: It is… in my back. Lower back, mostly. And sometimes in my… shoulders. It feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing. It is from the work, I think. Lifting boxes. Heavy things. It is not a problem, Doctor. I can still do the work. It is just… tiring. I take some… pills sometimes. For the pain. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back and shoulder tightness, especially with lifting at work. That makes sense. You mentioned taking pills for the pain – can you tell me what kind of pills those are, and roughly how often you take them?
PATIENT: They are… white. Small. I get them from the store. I do not remember the name. Ibuprofen, maybe? Something like that. When it hurts, I take two. Sometimes three. Not every day, like I said. When the work is… bad. Perhaps once or twice a week. I do not like taking pills. They do not fix the problem, only… cover it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen, as needed, roughly once or twice a week when the pain is worse. It's good you’re mindful of not wanting to rely on them. Now, besides the back and shoulder pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. I do not have a fever. I do not cough. I eat normally. I sleep… okay. Sometimes I am… a little tired, but who is not? I do not understand why you ask so many questions. Is this… usual? Everyone feels tired sometimes, Doctor. It is life.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Barban, feeling tired is perfectly normal. I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions, but I want to get a complete picture of your health. It's important to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Let's try this: have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? What does that mean? You ask very strange questions, Doctor. I… use the restroom. That is all. I do not need to tell you about this. This is… private. I do not understand why this is important for the insurance. Is this something they require? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that's a very personal question, Mr. Barban, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable. It’s standard practice to ask about these things as part of a general health assessment, to make sure everything is functioning normally. I should have explained that better. Let’s move on. Have you had any recent weight loss or weight gain that you haven't been trying for?
PATIENT: Weight? No. I eat. I do not diet. My weight is… the same. Always. Maybe a little more during the holidays, but that is… normal. Everyone gains weight during the holidays. You ask very strange questions, Doctor. This is a waste of my time. I just need this form signed so the insurance starts. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your frustration. It seems like I’m asking a lot of questions, and you’re understandably eager to get this paperwork completed. I want to assure you, I will complete the necessary paperwork for your insurance. However, to do that responsibly, I need to gather some basic information to ensure I’m providing the best possible care. To help me understand your overall health, could you tell me briefly about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? I do not… go to the doctor. I work. I eat. I sleep. I take some pills when my back hurts. That is my medical history. I have not had any… serious illnesses. Perhaps a cold sometimes, but that is all. I do not understand why this is important. Do I have to answer these questions? This is becoming very irritating.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your reluctance, and you are not required to answer any questions you are not comfortable with. However, knowing even a little bit about your past can help me ensure that the information I provide to Medicare is accurate and complete. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have always been healthy. I work hard. I do not sit around and get sick. I have never been inside a hospital. Why do you keep asking these questions? Are you questioning my health? This is… insulting. Just sign the form, Doctor. That is all I ask. Medicare, you know. I need the insurance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I sincerely apologize if my questions have come across as questioning your health. That was not my intention. I understand your frustration, and I respect your desire to simply get the necessary paperwork completed. Given your statement of good health and lack of prior medical history, I can complete the Medicare form based on the information you've provided. However, please understand that this will be a limited assessment. Before I do that, would you allow me to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Heart and lungs? That sounds… complicated. I just want the form signed, Doctor. I do not need a full examination. Is that necessary for the insurance? If it is not, then no. Just the form, please. I have work to do. This is wasting my time. Can we please finish this?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. I understand. We can proceed with completing the Medicare form based on the information you’ve provided. I will document that a full physical examination was declined. Before I complete the form, can you confirm for me that you do not have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any problems with medications. I take ibuprofen sometimes, like I said, and it is fine. No rash, no breathing problems, nothing. Just sign the form, Doctor. Please. This is very frustrating. I need to go back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. I am completing the form now. It should take just a few more moments. I will document your statement of good health, your occasional ibuprofen use, and your declination of a physical examination. I also recommend that you schedule a comprehensive check-up with me at your earliest convenience to establish ongoing care. Here you go. This should be sufficient for your Medicare enrollment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Thank you. Finally. No, that is all. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Barban. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or would like to schedule an appointment. .
