DOCTOR: Hi Reneisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… concerned about a weight gain, recently. It’s rather sudden, and I haven’t changed my habits, so to speak. I’m not sure what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden weight gain can be worrying, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. To get a better picture of what might be going on, let’s talk a little more about it. First, when you say “recently,” about how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It began, I believe, around the beginning of June. Perhaps mid-June. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly, but I noticed my clothes fitting more snugly then. And the scale… well, it has continued to climb steadily since.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly six to eight weeks. And about how much weight would you say you’ve gained during that time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… embarrassing to admit. Approximately seven kilograms, I think. Perhaps a little more. It feels… significant. I haven’t been weighing myself every day, naturally, but when I do, it’s consistently higher.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms is a noticeable change, yes. No need to be embarrassed at all – we're here to figure things out. And you're right to be concerned. Besides the weight gain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me see… not immediately, no. Though, now that you mention it, I have been feeling rather… fatigued. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And… my appetite has been somewhat diminished. Which is odd, considering the weight gain. I haven't been eating more, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That does make sense. Diminished appetite with weight gain is definitely something we want to explore. And the fatigue is important too. Let's do a quick review of your overall health history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I’ve always been… quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing… serious. I’ve never been hospitalized, and I don’t take any regular medication. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. My husband always says I’m too stubborn to get sick!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know! And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been fortunate in that regard as well. No surgeries, no major injuries… I try to be careful, you see. I don't like the idea of being unwell.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, thyroid problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe, in her later years. And my grandfather, on my father's side, suffered from… what was it? Something with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don't recall the specifics. No diabetes, as far as I know. My husband’s family… they are generally very healthy as well. A few cases of arthritis, perhaps, but nothing too serious. I am not sure about thyroid issues, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I have never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that is all. And recreational drugs… goodness, no. Never. I prefer a quiet evening at home with my husband. A very healthy lifestyle, as far as I’m concerned.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat most foods, and I haven't had any problems with medications in the past. I’m rather fortunate, you see. I am generally a very… unremarkable patient, in that regard. Though, I wish I could say the same about this weight gain!
DOCTOR: Well, even "unremarkable" patients can experience changes, and that's why you're here, and that’s good. Okay, so no known allergies, no surgeries, generally healthy history… Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement completely. I want to find out what is happening, and I am happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s confirm your height and weight. You mentioned around 155 centimeters… and your weight is currently 83 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Approximately 155 centimeters, and 83 kilograms. Though, I confess, I haven’t weighed myself today specifically. It fluctuates slightly, you see. But those numbers are reasonably accurate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 83.2 kilograms. Blood pressure is 138/86, pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. Heart sounds… I’m hearing a slight murmur, which I’ll need to investigate further. Your thyroid feels normal to palpation, and I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities in your abdomen. The murmur is something we need to look into, and your weight gain and fatigue, alongside the diminished appetite, are concerning. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infections or anemia. I also want to order an EKG to evaluate the heart murmur further. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound… good. But yes, Doctor, please, order whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgement. Blood tests and an EKG… yes, absolutely. I want to understand what’s happening, and I am happy to cooperate fully. When will I receive the results? And… is it something serious? I apologize for my anxiety, but… it’s unsettling to hear about a murmur.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Reneisha. It’s good you’re asking questions. A murmur doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong; it just means there’s an extra sound when your heart beats. The EKG and blood tests will help us determine the cause and whether any further investigation is needed. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Two to three business days… yes, that is reasonable. And I will certainly seek immediate medical attention if I experience any of those symptoms. Thank you for clarifying that. Yes, actually. I do have one question. Could this… weight gain be related to stress? My husband and I have been… preparing for our daughter's wedding. It's a great joy, of course, but there is a great deal of planning involved, and I have been feeling rather overwhelmed. Is it possible that could be contributing to this? It seems… a rather mundane explanation, but I thought I would ask.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Reneisha, and a perfectly valid one. Stress can absolutely contribute to weight gain, and it can also affect your appetite and energy levels. It causes hormonal changes that can lead to increased cravings, especially for sugary and fatty foods, and it can also disrupt your sleep, which further impacts your metabolism. However, given the murmur and the diminished appetite alongside the weight gain, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes first. We need to get the test results back before we can determine the extent to which stress is playing a role. In the meantime, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, remember to prioritize self-care. Make time for activities you enjoy, practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, and don’t hesitate to ask for help from your family and friends. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that answers everything. You have been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I will certainly prioritize self-care, and I will await the results of the tests with patience. Thank you again for your kindness and expertise. I will see you again once the results are available.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. It was my pleasure. Remember, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and try not to worry too much. .
