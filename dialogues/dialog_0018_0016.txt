DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about my bruising. It's getting… excessive. I’m on a blood thinner, naturally. Doctor Ramirez put me on it after… well, after my wife passed. But lately, just a little bump, a little scrape, and I look like I've been in a fight. It’s becoming quite a nuisance, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It sounds concerning when bruising occurs easily, particularly when you’re already taking a blood thinner. And I am very sorry to hear about your wife’s passing; that must have been a very difficult time. To help me understand what's happening, could you tell me a bit more about this bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, the details aren’t important. It’s bruising! Like I said, a little knock here, a little scrape there. It’s not like I'm falling down stairs every day. It's… illogical. I keep myself quite fit, for my age, you understand. I don’t understand why it’s happening now. It wasn’t this bad for the first few months on the medication. Is the dosage wrong, perhaps? That’s what I’m paying you to figure out.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Farson, and I assure you I’ll do my best to determine the cause of this increased bruising. It is important to investigate changes in how your medication is affecting you, even if it wasn't problematic initially. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a recent instance of bruising?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we go through every single bruise? Fine. Yesterday, I was… rearranging some books in the study. Just reaching for a volume on the top shelf. Brushed my arm against the corner of the bookcase. Hardly a forceful impact. And this morning? A magnificent purple bloom. It’s ridiculous. It looks like someone attacked me with a club. A very small club, admittedly, but still. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson, and I don't need a detailed account of every bruise. Knowing about the incident yesterday is helpful. Now, could you tell me what medication are you currently taking for the blood thinning?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? You don't already know? I filled out a form. I assumed your staff would have relayed that information to you. It’s… Warfarin. Five milligrams, Doctor Ramirez prescribed. And, as I said, it was perfectly fine for months. Now, suddenly, I’m turning into a walking bruise. It's most perplexing.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Mr. Farson, and I apologize for not checking your medication list first. My staff should have flagged that for me, and I will address that with them. Warfarin, five milligrams... Thank you for confirming that. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I don’t have a fever, if that’s what you’re getting at. And no, I haven’t been bleeding from… anywhere, if you must know. Just the bruising. And a general sense of… annoyance, frankly. It’s inconvenient. I have a golf tournament next week, and I can hardly show up looking like I've been pummeled. Do you understand the social implications of this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson, and I assure you I’m taking them seriously. The social implications are important, and we will address this. To rule out any other potential causes, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you noticed any unusual fatigue, weakness, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue? I'm 58, Doctor, not 80. Naturally, I tire a bit more easily than I used to, but that’s life. Appetite is fine. I still enjoy a good steak, thank you very much. I maintain a fairly regular routine, all things considered. Honestly, I suspect it’s the Warfarin. It’s the only thing that’s changed. Are you even listening to me, Doctor? I’ve explained this multiple times. Perhaps you should consult with Doctor Ramirez. He understood the situation perfectly well.
DOCTOR: I am listening very carefully, Mr. Farson, and I understand your frustration and your suspicion about the Warfarin. I do not doubt Doctor Ramirez’s expertise, and I may consult with him later if necessary. However, it is my responsibility to conduct a thorough evaluation to determine the most likely cause and ensure the best possible care for you. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Illnesses? No. Infections? Certainly not. Hospitalizations? Good heavens, no! I maintain a healthy lifestyle, as I've already mentioned. I am not a frequent visitor to hospitals, Doctor. This whole line of questioning feels… unnecessary. I came here because of the bruising, not to recount my entire medical history. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply going in circles?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel repetitive, Mr. Farson. You are right, we should focus on the bruising. However, ruling out other potential causes is an important part of the process. Let's shift gears slightly. Can you tell me about any family history of bleeding disorders or unusual bruising?
PATIENT: Family history? That's… a difficult question. My wife's side of the family… well, they weren't particularly forthcoming with medical details. My own father… he was a stoic sort. Never complained about a thing. As far as I know, no one suffered from any… bleeding tendencies. We weren't a family of hypochondriacs, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather pointless. I suspect it’s the Warfarin. Perhaps a lower dosage is in order? Can we at least discuss that?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. It is difficult to determine family history when information is limited. Now, are there any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking in addition to the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Supplements? Herbal remedies? Good heavens, no. I am not one of those… alternative medicine types. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Nothing that would interact with, or cause, this… unfortunate situation. I assure you. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I believe in science, not… potions and weeds. And frankly, I’m starting to feel as if you’re deliberately prolonging this consultation. Are we going to address the Warfarin, or are we simply going to continue this endless interrogation?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m creating that impression, Mr. Farson. I am not trying to prolong the consultation, but it’s important to gather all relevant information. Let me ask you this: Have you experienced any changes in your diet recently, particularly your intake of Vitamin K-rich foods?
PATIENT: Vitamin K-rich foods? Now we're discussing my diet? Honestly, Doctor! I eat a balanced diet. I enjoy a salad from time to time, and yes, I occasionally have some spinach. What does that have to do with anything? This is becoming absurd. I came here because of the bruising. I suspect the Warfarin. I’ve explained this repeatedly. Are you even listening to me, or are you simply following a checklist? Perhaps I should request a second opinion. This is utterly ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson, and I apologize for the line of questioning. You are right to point out that we are focusing on the Warfarin, and it is a very reasonable concern. Let’s perform a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to examine the bruising and check for any other signs that might help us determine the cause. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But I assure you, it will simply confirm what I’ve been saying all along. It’s the Warfarin. A perfectly sensible explanation. Just… be gentle. It’s rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. This doesn't appear to be acutely inflamed, and there's tenderness to palpation, as you mentioned. The bruising is primarily on your forearms, and the coloration suggests it's a few days old. I don’t see any signs of a deeper hematoma or any other immediate concerns. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to ensure everything is stable. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72 and regular. Given your history and the physical exam, it does seem plausible that the Warfarin dosage might need adjustment. However, before making any changes, I want to order a Prothrombin Time test. This will give us a precise measure of how your blood is clotting and help us determine the correct dosage. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. A sensible suggestion. A test. Numbers. Something concrete. Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. As long as it leads to a lower dosage of this… troublesome medication. I trust your lab can expedite the results? I have a golf tournament next week, you understand. And I’d rather not resemble a bruise victim when I arrive.
DOCTOR: I will certainly prioritize the order, Mr. Farson. I will also put in a request for a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. The lab should be able to get the results back to us within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I want you to be vigilant about any new bruising or bleeding, however minor. If you experience any unusual bleeding – from the gums, nose, or anywhere else – please contact me immediately. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss the next steps. We will adjust your Warfarin dosage as needed to ensure your safety and allow you to enjoy your golf tournament. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… will do. As long as it results in a lower dosage. And please, do expedite those results. My golf partners are expecting a formidable opponent, not a walking testament to the perils of blood thinners. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Farson. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and I wish you well at your tournament.
PATIENT: .
