DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my legs. They just… gave out, practically. Not all at once, mind you. It started a few days ago, after I had a terrible cold. Just feeling weak, you know? Like they might buckle under me. And then yesterday, well, let's just say walking wasn't exactly easy.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, weakness in your legs, starting a few days ago after a cold. And it worsened yesterday, making walking difficult. Can you tell me a little more about that weakness?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to describe. It’s not painful, exactly. More like… heavy. Like I’m trying to lift weights with them, even when I’m not. And it’s both legs, which is what’s so worrying. Normally, things happen on one side, don’t they? I’m not a doctor, of course, but that’s what I’ve always heard. It started gradually, just feeling a little unsteady, but yesterday I nearly fell in the grocery store. That’s when I decided I needed to see someone. It’s really inconvenient, to be honest. I have a tour planned next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy feeling in both legs, not painful, started gradually, worsened to the point of nearly falling. And you have a tour planned next week, so timing isn't ideal. Just to clarify, when you say “cold,” did you have a fever, cough, congestion… anything specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a proper cold. Achy all over, dreadful cough – kept me up all night, really. Stuffy nose, you know the drill. No fever that I noticed, but I wasn’t really taking my temperature, if that makes a difference. Just miserable. It ran its course, or so I thought. I assumed the legs were just… a lingering bit of weakness from being sick. But it hasn't gotten better. It's just… stayed. And gotten a bit worse, really. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, cold symptoms – achy, cough, congestion, no fever to your knowledge. And the leg weakness started after the cold resolved. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. No numbness. Just… weakness. Like I said, heavy. It’s not like they’re completely useless, I can still walk, albeit very carefully. But it’s definitely not normal. Honestly, Doctor, I pride myself on my fitness. I lead tours, remember? This is… disconcerting. And quite frankly, I don’t like feeling vulnerable. I need to be strong.
DOCTOR: Okay. No numbness or tingling, just weakness. You're typically fit and lead tours, so this is a change for you. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up for me and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I’m perfectly capable of describing my symptoms. I don’t see what walking will prove. But if you insist. There. Carefully now. Don’t want to fall and cause a scene. See? Not exactly graceful, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your gait is slightly wide-based and you appear to be using some effort to maintain your balance. I'm noting some mild weakness in both legs, particularly with dorsiflexion of your feet - that means lifting your toes upwards. Reflexes are normal. Strength is 4/5 bilaterally, which is reduced but not severely so. Any history of diabetes, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens, no! I eat very healthily, I assure you. Lots of fruits and vegetables. I’m a very active person. That’s a… rather insulting question, Doctor. Are you suggesting I've brought this on myself? Because, frankly, that's a little… condescending. I take very good care of my body. And I certainly don't have time for sugar-laden treats. My tours don’t run on cookies, you know.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, I apologize, Ms. Firestone. I didn’t mean to imply anything of the sort. I ask everyone about diabetes as it can sometimes cause neuropathy – nerve damage – which can present with leg weakness. It's a standard part of the examination. My apologies for phrasing it poorly. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, I had a rather nasty bout of shingles a few years back. Very painful, that was. And I’ve always had… trouble with my digestion, if you must know. Nothing serious, just… a delicate stomach. I don’t take any regular medication, if that’s what you’re asking. Just the occasional antacid, when necessary. And I was divorced, if that’s relevant. A stressful time, naturally. Though I doubt that’s causing my legs to give way. Really, Doctor, I just want to know what’s wrong with my legs and how quickly I can fix it. I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of shingles and some digestive issues, no regular medications, and a past stressful divorce. I understand your concern about getting back to your tour. Given your symptoms and the recent cold, it's possible this is post-viral weakness, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Let me quickly review your EHR… Okay, nothing major jumps out. To be cautious, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, electrolytes, vitamin B12, and vitamin D levels. I'm also going to order a basic metabolic panel. I will also order an MRI of your lumbar spine to rule out any nerve compression.
PATIENT: An MRI? Really? That seems… excessive. I just had a cold, Doctor. It’s not like I’ve suffered a catastrophic injury. And blood work? For a few weak legs? Honestly. I suppose I have no choice if that’s what you deem necessary, but I hope it doesn't take too long. I have a schedule to keep. And what exactly are you hoping to find with all these tests? Are you suggesting something serious? Because, frankly, you’re starting to alarm me. I just want a simple explanation and a quick solution, not a battery of invasive procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. I don't want to alarm you, but it's my responsibility to rule out anything serious. The blood work will help us look for vitamin deficiencies or any underlying metabolic issues that could contribute to weakness. The MRI of the lumbar spine will check for any compression of the nerves in your lower back, which could be causing the symptoms in your legs. It’s a precaution, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We need to gather information to determine the best course of action. I’m sending the orders to the lab now. You can schedule the MRI at the imaging center across the street. They take most insurance plans, including Medicare. They will call you to arrange an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity. Is there anything else you would like to discuss at this time?
PATIENT: Strenuous activity? Doctor, I lead tours! Avoiding strenuous activity is… impractical. But fine. I suppose. Medicare should cover it, you say? Good. I don’t have time for billing disputes. I suppose… no. I think that’s all. Just please, expedite this process. The sooner I know what’s going on, the sooner I can get back to work. And please, try not to overcomplicate things. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I want a simple explanation, not a medical lecture. Thank you. I suppose. .
