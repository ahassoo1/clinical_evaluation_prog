DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's probably nothing, but my ex-husband keeps making comments. He says my breath smells. It’s… irritating, really. I brush, okay? I always brush. It’s just… him being difficult, probably. But I figured I’d get it checked just to shut him up.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s always good to rule things out, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to address concerns, especially if they’re causing you stress. So, it sounds like the main issue is a concern about your breath odour, and you brush regularly. Okay. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you notice this, or when your ex-husband brings it up?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? Usually after I’ve had… well, after I eat, I guess. Sometimes in the morning. He’s just… very observant, which is to say, nosy. And critical. It’s not like I’m sitting here analyzing my own breath all day. I just want him to stop bringing it up. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. It sounds frustrating. Okay, so mostly after eating and sometimes in the morning. Does it seem to be worse with certain foods, or is it pretty consistent no matter what you’ve eaten?
PATIENT: Honestly? Everything. He complains no matter what I eat. Garlic, onions, fish… even just, like, a salad! He’ll find something. It’s ridiculous. I just… I don’t know what to tell you. He's a drama queen. Is it possible he's just making things up?
DOCTOR: It's definitely possible he's exaggerating, or focusing on it more than others would. It's good you’re considering that. But let's rule out any medical causes just to be sure. Besides the comments from your ex-husband, are you noticing anything different about your breath, or your mouth in general?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. That's why I said it's probably him. My mouth feels… normal. I don't have bad taste or anything. I don't get… sores. I really don't think there's anything wrong with me. He just likes to be… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No changes in taste, no sores, just the comments from your ex-husband. Have you noticed any changes in your saliva – is your mouth feeling drier than usual, or are you producing more saliva?
PATIENT: Dry? Not really. I mean, I don’t specifically think about how much spit I have, if that’s what you’re asking. It feels… normal. Look, I drink water. I don’t go around with a desert mouth. This is getting… tedious. Are we going to find anything, or is this just a waste of time?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels tedious. We're just trying to cover all the bases. Okay, so no noticeable dryness. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick exam. Have you been experiencing any nasal congestion, a sore throat, or postnasal drip recently?
PATIENT: No. Look, I work outside. Highway maintenance. I get a little dusty sometimes, okay? But no congestion, no sore throat, no… whatever that last thing was. I'm not sick! Is this going anywhere? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right, highway maintenance – so some dust exposure is likely. Okay, no congestion, sore throat, or postnasal drip. And you’re not feeling generally unwell. Alright. I’d like to just take a quick look in your mouth and listen to your breathing, if that’s alright. It will only take a few minutes. Then we can discuss what this might be, and what the next steps are. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax. I’m going to have you open wide and say “ah.” Okay, everything looks reasonably normal. Your throat isn’t inflamed, and your lungs sound clear. I did notice your mouth seems a little dry, but that could be from just having me look, or from dust exposure at work. Now, sometimes bad breath isn’t a medical problem at all, but can be caused by things like certain foods, smoking, or poor oral hygiene – though you said you brush regularly. It’s also possible, and sometimes common, for people to not accurately perceive their own breath odour. We can also sometimes have a build up of bacteria on the back of the tongue. Have you ever used a tongue scraper?
PATIENT: A tongue scraper? Seriously? No. I brush my teeth, don’t I? I don’t need a special tool. Look, I’m telling you, it’s him. He’s just looking for something to complain about. Is that what you’re going to tell me? That my ex-husband is a jerk? Because frankly, that’s the diagnosis I’m expecting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I'm not dismissing your feelings at all. It's perfectly valid to feel like he's being difficult. However, as a doctor, it's my job to rule out any potential medical causes, even if it seems unlikely. While it's very possible your ex-husband is exaggerating or being overly critical, there are a few things we can try. Sometimes, improving oral hygiene even if you already brush can help. Using a tongue scraper can remove bacteria that contribute to odour. Also, staying well-hydrated can help with saliva production. I'd like to suggest you try using a tongue scraper twice a day and drinking at least eight glasses of water a day for a week. If the comments continue, then it may very well be his perception. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. A tongue scraper. Eight glasses of water. It's ridiculous, but… fine. Just to get him off my back. But if it doesn't work, I'm blaming you for wasting my time. And I expect a note for work, explaining why I was here, because he’ll ask. Does that sound clear? .
DOCTOR: Absolutely clear. I’m writing a note for work now explaining the consultation and our recommendations. And I completely understand your frustration. Here’s a prescription for a tongue scraper – it’s inexpensive and available at most pharmacies. And I’ll reiterate the recommendation to drink eight glasses of water a day. If the comments from your ex-husband continue after a week of trying these things, feel free to schedule another appointment, and we can discuss further options. Perhaps a referral to a dentist to rule out any underlying dental issues might be helpful then. Do you have any other questions for me today?
