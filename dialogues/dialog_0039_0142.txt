DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Thanks for havin' me. It’s… well, it’s these headaches, I guess. They come on pretty strong sometimes. And I get really sweaty when they do, and my heart feels like it’s racin'. It's hard to explain, really. I don't… I don't remember exactly when they started, just that they’ve been happenin’ more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come on strong, with sweating and a racing heart… That does sound unsettling. It's alright if you don't remember specifics, we'll try to piece things together. When you say "pretty strong," can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not like a constant ache, not usually. It's more like… a build-up. Starts kinda dull, then gets sharper, like a band tightenin' around my head. Sometimes it feels like it's behind my eyes, too. It’s hard to focus when it's bad, everything gets blurry. And it's usually on both sides, not just one spot. Does that make sense? I'm not great at explainin' things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jaxston. A build-up, tightening sensation, both sides of the head, blurry vision… that gives me a better picture. And how long do these headaches typically last?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I honestly couldn't say for sure. It feels like hours sometimes, but it could be less. I usually just try to lie down in a dark room ‘til it goes away. I don't really keep track of time when I'm feelin' awful. It’s… it’s kinda a blur, to be honest. Sorry. I wish I was more helpful.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Jaxston. It’s perfectly understandable. It’s hard to remember details when you’re not feeling well. We'll work with what you do recall. Now, you mentioned sweating and a racing heart. Does that happen every time you get a headache, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly when they’re really bad, I think. Like, the ones that build up quick and feel super tight. Not every headache, no. Some are just… bad headaches, you know? But the sweaty, heart-racin' ones are the ones that scare me a bit. It feels like somethin's really wrong. It’s hard to explain. I don’t know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jaxston. It sounds like those more intense headaches are different from the others, and understandably worrying. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Uh… not really. I’ve tried to think about it. I work pretty regular hours, same kinda work every day. I don’t really… do much different. Sometimes I forget to drink enough water, but I don’t know if that’s it. I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. It just… happens. Which is kinda frustrating, I guess. I wish I could figure out why.
DOCTOR: Okay. No clear triggers identified, that's alright. Let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I mean, I had the usual kid stuff, chickenpox and stuff. But nothin' serious. I got divorced a couple years back, which was… rough, but I didn’t need a doctor for that. Aside from that, I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. I haven’t been to a doctor in ages, to be honest. Maybe five years? Six? It’s all a bit of a blur. Sorry, I’m not very good at rememberin’ dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Jaxston. Don't worry about dates. No major medical conditions diagnosed, and you haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries, never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Just… headaches now. It's weird, kinda scary how they just started comin’ on stronger lately. It's like somethin's changed, but I can't put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries or hospital stays. That’s good to know. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I sometimes take paracetamol if a headache's really bad, but that's about it. And I don't do that very often, just when I absolutely have to. No regular meds, no supplements, nothin' like that. I try to avoid takin’ pills if I can. I don't really like them, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications or supplements. That's helpful to know. Now, a quick question about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes in the spring, but that's just sneezin’ and a runny nose. Not an allergy allergy, I don't think. Not like a rash or trouble breathin' or anything. Just… seasonal stuff. I don't think I'm allergic to anything serious. I've always been pretty good in that department.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of headaches, migraines, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a tough one. I wasn't super close with my family, to be honest. My… my dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mum… she complained about headaches a lot, but I don't know if they were like these headaches. Just… regular headaches, I guess. I don't know if anyone else had migraines or anything. It wasn’t really somethin’ we talked about. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Family history wasn't a big thing in my family.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaxston. It's common not to have a lot of information about family history. We'll work with what you know. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t smoke, never have. I have a pint with my mates sometimes, on a Saturday, but that's about it. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been into any of that. I try to stay pretty healthy, all things considered. Work hard, eat alright, have a pint now and then. That’s about it. Not much of an exciting life, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a pretty good picture, Jaxston. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. So, to summarise, you've been experiencing headaches that come on strong, sometimes accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. They haven’t been constant, and you haven’t noticed any specific triggers. You’ve never been diagnosed with any medical conditions, haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, don’t take any medications, have no known allergies, and your family history is limited. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, pulse, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Anything to figure out what's goin' on. I'm just… worried, I guess. It's kinda scary when somethin' changes, ya know? Especially when you don't know why. So, yeah, physical exam sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. It’s perfectly normal to be worried when something changes. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, if you could just lie down for me, please. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140 over 90, a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 88, regular rhythm. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal on both sides. And finally, just a quick neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I’ll check your facial strength and coordination. Eyes are tracking normally, facial strength is good, and coordination is good. Overall, the physical exam is largely normal. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor, but the rest seems fine. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your headaches. However, the combination of headaches, sweating, and a racing heart could suggest a few possibilities. It could be tension headaches, migraines, or, less commonly, something else. Given your elevated blood pressure, we need to rule out secondary causes, meaning something else causing the headaches. Would you be open to getting some blood work done and possibly an EKG to check your heart rhythm?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Blood work and an EKG sounds… sensible, I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just want to know what's goin' on, ya know? These headaches are makin' me nervous. If it’s somethin' serious, I want to know. If it's just stress, then great. But I need to know. So, yeah, blood work and an EKG sounds good. When can we do that?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. You’re right to want answers, and we'll get them. Blood work and an EKG are a good starting point. We can do those right here in the clinic today. The blood work will check for things like infection, inflammation, and electrolyte imbalances. The EKG will check your heart rhythm and look for any abnormalities. I'll write up the orders for the lab and EKG now. It'll probably take about 30 minutes to get everything done. While we're waiting, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help with the headaches in the meantime. I also want to be cautious, so I’m going to recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive heart evaluation, just to rule out any underlying heart conditions. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your elevated blood pressure and the racing heart symptom. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… thorough, I guess. A cardiologist sounds sensible too, if you think it’s best. I trust your judgement, Doc. I just want to get this sorted. So, yeah, let's do the blood work, the EKG, and the referral to the cardiologist. Whatever it takes to figure out what's goin' on. Thirty minutes sounds good. I guess I'll just sit here and try not to worry too much. Is there anything I should be doin’ in the meantime? Anythin' I should not be doin'?
DOCTOR: That's a very good attitude, Jaxston. We're taking all the necessary steps. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity or anything that might trigger your headaches. Stay hydrated, and get some rest. If your headaches become severe, or if you experience any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here’s the referral to the cardiologist, and this slip is for the lab. They’re just down the hall. Once you've had the blood work and EKG, let the receptionist know and they’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds clear. Receptionist… blood work… EKG… follow-up appointment. Got it. Okay, I guess I’ll go get the blood work done then. Thank you, Doc. I really appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and not just brush it off. It’s… kinda scary when somethin's wrong, and you don’t know why. So, thank you. I’ll see you at the follow-up then. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers by then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. That’s what I’m here for. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
