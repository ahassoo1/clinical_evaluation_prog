DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness... well, my wife, bless her heart, she said I need to get some… papers. For, uh… time off? Or maybe if I can’t work. Something about the… the church, and needing documentation. I get so mixed up these days, you see. It’s the… FMLA, I think she mentioned? Or disability? Honestly, it all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can certainly sort that out. It sounds like there's a bit of confusion, which is perfectly alright. Let’s focus on why you might need this paperwork. Are you experiencing any health issues that are making it difficult to work?
PATIENT: Health issues… hmm. Well, I get tired. Really tired. More than usual, I suppose. And my… my memory isn’t what it used to be, as you can probably tell. It makes doing… well, anything that requires thinking… difficult. It's hard to explain. I still go to the church, do my best with the activities, but… things slip my mind. Names, dates, what I was just talking about... It's frustrating, for everyone, really. I don't know if that counts as a health issue, though. It just feels like getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts as something we should investigate. Fatigue and memory issues can be symptoms of several things, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just being sleepy, Doctor. It's more like… a weight. Like trying to walk through water, all the time. I used to be able to do things all day, the church work, things around the house, even a little gardening. Now… I have to sit down after just a short time. And it doesn’t get better with rest, not really. I wake up tired, and I stay tired. It's been… a while now. Months, I think. Maybe longer. My wife keeps track of these things better than I do. She's a saint, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, and has this fatigue been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me see… My wife says I’m a bit more… quiet than I used to be. And I get… easily confused, like we were talking about. Sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. It's not all the time, but it's happening more and more. Oh! And I’ve been… clumsier, I think. Knocking things over, bumping into things. Small things, really, but… noticeable. I haven’t fallen or anything, thankfully. Does that make sense? I’m rambling, aren't I?
DOCTOR: That all makes sense, Mr. Limtiaco. Those symptoms – the fatigue, the confusion, the word-finding difficulties, the clumsiness – are things we need to explore further. Let's do a quick review of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… goodness. Let me see. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. I had my prostate checked a few years back, all clear then. And my blood pressure has been a little high sometimes, but it’s usually controlled with… a little pill. That's about it, I think. Nothing major. I haven’t been to a doctor much in the last… well, a long time. My wife usually handles all that. She’ll probably remember better than I do, honestly. Is it important if I don't remember everything?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything, Mr. Limtiaco. We have your records here, and we can always verify details. But it's helpful to get your perspective as well. You mentioned a pill for your blood pressure – do you know the name of it, or approximately how long you’ve been taking it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don't, Doctor. It’s a small white pill, I think. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I've been taking it for… oh, five years? Maybe longer. It's a bit blurry, to be honest. My wife keeps the pills organized, and I just take what she gives me. I trust her completely, you see. She’s very good with these things. I don’t want to bother her now, though, she's busy with the church bake sale. Is it really important what kind of pill it is?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Limtiaco, but we'll figure it out. We can likely get the information from your pharmacy records. Okay, let's move on to medications beyond the blood pressure pill. Are you taking any other vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin, I think. Just a standard one, for old people. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take… ibuprofen? Or maybe naproxen? One of those painkillers. But not very often. Just when I've been gardening too much. My wife gets them for me at the store. Everything is a little hazy, you know? I don't really pay much attention to the names. She handles all that. Is it bad that I don’t remember? I feel like I’m being a nuisance.
DOCTOR: You're not being a nuisance at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s very common for patients to have difficulty remembering medication names, especially with multiple prescriptions. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. Let’s briefly talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat everything my wife cooks, and she’s a wonderful cook, so that's a good sign! I’ve never had a problem with pollen or anything like that, either. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. My wife always asks when I get a new prescription, though, just to be safe. She’s very cautious, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk briefly about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… goodness. My mother… she had… something with her memory, I think. Towards the end of her life, she got very confused. My father… he had a heart problem, I believe. That's about all I remember, Doctor. They're both gone now, and it was a long time ago. I wasn’t very close to either of them, to be honest. My wife knows more about these things. She always asks questions, keeps track of everything. I'm afraid I’m not much help with this part, either. It feels like my memory is just… fading away. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to have difficulty recalling family history, especially with time. It's alright. Okay, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t know, Doctor. I haven’t really been paying attention to my weight. My clothes feel… a little looser, maybe? And my wife says I haven’t been eating as much, but she also says I’m a picky eater, always have been. I just haven’t been feeling very hungry lately, I suppose. I don't have much of an appetite these days. Everything tastes… bland, somehow. It’s hard to explain. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's good to be aware of those changes. Alright, one final question for now. How would you describe your usual level of activity?
PATIENT: My usual level of activity… well, it's not much these days, Doctor. I used to be very active. I loved gardening, working around the church… I still try to help, but I have to take a lot of breaks. I get tired very easily, you see. Now, mostly I just sit. I read a little, watch some television… I spend a lot of time with my wife, thankfully. She’s very patient with me. I walk a little, but not very far. It’s just… harder now, everything. I get discouraged easily. I feel like I'm slowing down, becoming a burden. Is that… is that normal? Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel discouraged when your body isn't doing what it used to. And it's good you're sharing these feelings with me. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, I think we have enough information for now. If you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. I get nervous around doctors, always have. And I'm afraid of bad news, you see. It's just… a lot to take in, all this. But I'm ready, if you are. Let's get it over with. Just… let me know what you're doing as you go, okay? It helps to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Breathing sounds are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam… Your balance is a little unsteady, and eye movements are a bit slow. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. I’m going to take a look at your records, and then we can discuss what these findings mean. It will take me just a moment.
