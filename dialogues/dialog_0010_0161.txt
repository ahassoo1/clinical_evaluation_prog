DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into… preventative things. About HIV. She said there’s a pill you can take before you even get it. Is that right? I’m not… I don’t have it, but I want to be careful, you know? Just being prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's very responsible of you to think ahead. What your friend mentioned is called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It's a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. It's highly effective, and we can definitely discuss if it's right for you. First, let's go through a bit of your medical history, just to make sure we have a complete picture. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, maybe… fifteen years? It was negative then, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when or where. Just… routine, I guess, when I was with someone. But it was negative. I’m pretty sure. I have a good memory, generally, but details like that… slip.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen years ago is a good starting point, but given the time that’s passed, we’ll want to get a current HIV test today just to be certain. It’s important for us to have that baseline. And to determine if PrEP is appropriate, I need to ask a few questions about your risk factors. Could you tell me a little bit about your current sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Um… well, I’m single, as in, haven't been in a long-term relationship in… a while. I do date, occasionally. It’s…casual. And I’ve had a few different partners in the last year. Not a lot, but… enough. Does that make sense? I just… I don’t want to be embarrassed, but I want to be honest. I’m careful, I always use protection, but… you can’t be too careful, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Trefren. Honesty is the most important thing, and you’ve explained that perfectly. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this, and it’s smart to want to explore all options for protection, even if you’re already using condoms. To clarify, when you say "condoms," are you referring to latex condoms, or are you using other types of barrier protection?
PATIENT: Latex. Always latex. I’ve been using them since… forever, honestly. I don't even think about it anymore, it’s just… habit. And I make sure they haven't expired, of course. I'm not careless about it. But I've heard stories, you know? And with… things changing all the time, I just want to be extra sure. Is that… silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Trefren. It's never a bad idea to be informed and proactive about your health, especially with evolving information. Condoms are excellent protection, but they aren’t 100% effective. PrEP can offer an additional layer of security. Now, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any underlying health conditions, like kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I have… high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I see my regular doctor for that, and it’s been stable for years. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, honestly. I walk every day, I eat… reasonably well. I'm not a saint, but I take care of myself. And I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. They haven't said anything about my kidneys or liver ever being a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Controlled hypertension is important to note, and we will monitor that if you start PrEP, as it can sometimes affect kidney function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've taken… a lot of different medications over the years for various things, but never had a reaction. Nothing serious, anyway. A little bit of indigestion sometimes, but nothing I would call an allergy. I remember being given penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago and I don’t recall any trouble with it. Does that help? I really try to remember these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Trefren. Your good recall is appreciated. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think. I take… lisinopril for my blood pressure, that's the one my doctor prescribed. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Over the counter, you know? Just the regular kind. And occasionally, a multivitamin. That's it, I think. Honestly, I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can. It just feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful. Lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. Now, before we discuss PrEP further, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and order some lab work. It's standard procedure to ensure you're a good candidate and to establish a baseline. That will include a check of your kidney function, liver function, and a test for any sexually transmitted infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I understand. That makes sense. I just want to be sure, you know? And I'd rather know everything is okay. So, yes. Let's do the exam and the labs. How long will it take? I have an appointment later this afternoon, so I don’t want to be too long.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It shouldn't take too long. The physical exam will just be a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll just need a blood sample and a urine sample. The lab work typically takes a few days to come back. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. I always get a little nervous at the doctor's office, even though I know it’s silly. It's just… needles, mostly. But I’ll try to relax. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 132/80, which is well-controlled. That's good. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Everything sounds clear. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to order the lab work. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an STI screening. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good for now. Just… when I get the results, will I get a call? Or do I need to schedule another appointment? I just want to know what to expect. And… is PrEP something you'd recommend for someone like me, if everything comes back okay? I mean, based on what I've told you. I just want an honest opinion.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question. The lab results will take approximately 3-5 business days. Once they are available, the nurse will contact you by phone to discuss them. If everything is within normal limits, we can certainly discuss starting PrEP. Based on what you’ve told me – your current sexual activity with multiple partners, your commitment to using condoms, and your desire to be proactive about your health – PrEP would be a reasonable option to consider, yes. It’s a very effective way to reduce your risk of HIV infection. However, we’ll need to review the lab results first to ensure there are no contraindications. The nurse will be with you shortly to start the lab work. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And thank you for being honest. I just… I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to stay healthy. It’s just… with everything going on in the world, you can never be too careful. I guess I'll just… wait for the nurse then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Trefren. That’s a perfectly reasonable approach, and I commend you for taking charge of your health. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. Have a good day, and we'll be in touch soon with your results.
