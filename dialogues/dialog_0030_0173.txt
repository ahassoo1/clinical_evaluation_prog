DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi, good morning! It's nice to meet you too, Dr. Quicksey. Um, well, I've been getting chills lately. It's a bit odd, honestly. Not a fever, just… cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills without a fever, that is good information. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Sure. It's hard to explain… they just come and go. Sometimes they’re really noticeable, like a full body shiver, and other times it’s just a feeling of being cold even when I’m not. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific. Like, I don't get them only when I'm cold, you know? I was even a little chilly this morning even though it's August. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It's helpful to know they aren’t consistently related to temperature. And you mentioned they’ve been happening lately – about how long have you been experiencing these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Probably for about a week, maybe a little longer? It started gradually, just feeling a bit off, and then it became more noticeable. I didn’t really think much of it at first, just figured I was tired or something. But it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week or so. And besides the chills, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying them?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I've been a little more tired than usual, but I always chalk that up to… well, life, you know? Nothing major. No cough, no sore throat, no aches or anything like that. Just the chills and a bit of fatigue. Oh, actually… now that I think about it, maybe I've been a little more thirsty than usual, but I figured that was just the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills, fatigue, and potentially increased thirst. Let's explore that thirst a bit more. Would you describe it as constantly feeling thirsty, or just drinking more fluids than usual because it's hot?
PATIENT: It’s probably more just drinking more, yeah. It's been so hot! I've been trying to stay hydrated, so I'm definitely drinking more water than usual. I wouldn't say I'm parched all the time, just… making sure I drink enough. I guess I just thought it was normal for August.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, but nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s about it. I don't have any ongoing health problems, and I haven't been hospitalized for anything. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. Have you had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No, just the tonsils. Nothing else. And honestly, that was when I was little, so I don’t really remember much about it. I've been pretty lucky, haven’t needed anything else done.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um... my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart problems when he was older, but other than that, nobody really has any major health issues. It's a pretty healthy family overall, I think. Nothing like, genetic diseases or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sometimes take a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. And I don't take any vitamins or supplements, I've never really gotten into that. I try to eat healthy, so I figure I get what I need from my food.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! I can eat anything, take any medication without issue, as far as I'm aware. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty boring that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, and I definitely don't do any drugs. I try to live a pretty healthy lifestyle. I work as a health education specialist, so... I should practice what I preach, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's wonderful. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Great. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also within the normal range. Blood pressure is 120/80, which is good. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Your throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Ears and nose appear normal as well. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. Based on this initial examination, there aren't any obvious signs of infection or other acute illness. However, given your symptoms of chills and fatigue, I’d like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. If you think it's best to do the blood work, then yes, definitely. I want to figure out what's going on, so I’m happy to do whatever you recommend.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll do a complete blood count to check your white blood cell count and look for signs of infection. We'll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause symptoms like chills and fatigue. And we'll do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. The lab technician will come to draw your blood shortly. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the process?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. It all sounds pretty straightforward. So they'll just take some blood, and then you'll let me know the results? How long do you think it'll take to get them back?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. They’ll just need a small sample of blood. Results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a balanced diet. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe headache, body aches, or difficulty breathing – please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Quicksey, for taking the time to listen and run the tests. I appreciate it. I’ll try to get some extra rest and stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. We’ll be in touch as soon as your results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
