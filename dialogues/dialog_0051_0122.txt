DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, recently, things have been… slipping. My memory, you understand. It is… concerning. I am 53, and I have always had a… good mind. But now… little things. I forget where I put my keys, or… what I was saying mid-sentence. It is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. It's certainly concerning when you notice changes in your memory, especially when it feels out of the ordinary for you. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Twenty-nine years in medicine, and I've seen this present in many ways. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing these slips?
PATIENT: Hmm… when, exactly? That is… a difficult question. It has been… gradual. Perhaps… three months ago? No, maybe four. It started with small things, as I said. Misplacing items. But then… repeating questions. Asking my neighbor the same thing twice in one hour. It is… embarrassing. And frightening. I do not like to feel… unstable. I have always been very organized. Very… in control.
DOCTOR: Four months… that's helpful. And it sounds like it's been progressively worsening, which is important to note. Repeating questions to the same person within a short timeframe… yes, that is concerning. Now, has this memory issue been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… other changes? Let me think. My blood pressure has been… higher than usual, I believe. My doctor – Doctor Volkov, he passed away last year, a very good man – he always monitored it. I take medication, but… sometimes I forget to take it. Which… perhaps explains things. I also… feel a little more tired than before. Not constantly, but… a general lack of energy. And sometimes… just a little… confused. Like I am… searching for a word. Or a thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, higher blood pressure, occasional forgetfulness with medication, increased fatigue, and some difficulty finding words… those are all things we need to consider. It’s good you mentioned Dr. Volkov; we can look at his records if available. Now, about the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure… do you recall what it’s called, and what dosage you typically take?
PATIENT: Ah… the medication. Let me see… Doctor Volkov, he wrote everything down very neatly. I have it at home, in my… medication box. It is a white pill, I believe. Small. And… I take two of them, every morning and every evening. The name… it is… starting with an “A,” I think. Amlodipine? Is that correct? Yes, Amlodipine. Five milligrams each pill, I believe. I am quite certain. I have always been very… careful with my medication. Despite… recent difficulties.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, 5 milligrams twice a day… alright. That’s helpful. And you said you've been generally careful with it, but have noticed some slips recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Usually, I have a routine. Wake up, take my pills with breakfast. Evening, same thing. But… sometimes I am distracted. A phone call from my niece, or… a visitor. And I forget. And then… an hour passes, two hours. And I remember, and take it then. It is… not ideal, I understand. I feel… foolish admitting this. I used to be so… precise.
DOCTOR: Please don’t feel foolish, Ms. Alvara. Life happens, and routines get disrupted. It’s very common, and it doesn’t diminish your intelligence or character at all. We're simply trying to gather information to understand what's going on. Now, let’s move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: No… not really. My appetite is… normal. I enjoy my food. I eat… reasonably. Perhaps a little less than before, but that is… because I am not as hungry. My weight… I have not weighed myself recently, but I do not believe it has changed significantly. I am… tall. One hundred and ninety-five centimeters, I believe. And I weigh… one hundred and thirty-six kilograms. Yes, approximately. And my sleep… I sleep… okay. Sometimes I wake up in the night, but that is… to use the bathroom. Or… just to think. Nothing… alarming.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite, weight, or sleep… that’s good. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or difficulty with balance or coordination recently?
PATIENT: Headaches… no, not really. A little tension sometimes, from stress, perhaps. But nothing… debilitating. Vision… my vision is… fine. I wear glasses, as you can see. But my prescription has not changed recently. I had my eyes checked last year. Balance… no. I have not fallen, or… felt unsteady. I walk… normally. I am a… careful person. I do not rush. Coordination… yes. Perhaps… sometimes I fumble with things. Dropping a spoon, or… misplacing my glasses. Small things. Not… a major problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major headaches, vision changes, or balance issues. Some minor fumbling, which you attribute to being distracted. This is all helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had… heart problems. High blood pressure, I believe. She passed away when I was… young. My father… he was… healthy. Very strong. But he… suffered from… anxiety. My brother… he is alive, living in Moscow. He has… diabetes. And… I believe my uncle, on my mother’s side, had… dementia, perhaps? I am not certain. It was… many years ago. I do not… remember the details. It was… a sad time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems and high blood pressure in your mother, anxiety in your father, diabetes in your brother, and possible dementia in an uncle. That's important to note. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No. I do not believe so. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I eat… most things. I have never had… hives, or… difficulty breathing. I am… quite healthy, generally. Aside from… this. This memory issue, and… the blood pressure. And… the tiredness. But no… allergies. I do not take… many medications, aside from the Amlodipine. Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me, and given your history, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be related to your blood pressure control, vitamin deficiencies, or, given the family history, we need to consider the possibility of early cognitive changes. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. And then, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and kidney function. We can also run a basic cognitive assessment here in the office. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A physical exam, blood work, and… a cognitive assessment. Yes. I want to… understand what is happening. I do not want to… ignore this. I want to be… proactive. I am a… responsible person. And I… appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It is… reassuring. When can we… begin?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Alvara. It’s always best to be proactive. Alright, let’s start with the physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure… 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment… I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll test your reflexes and coordination.
PATIENT: Very well. Follow your finger… yes, I can do that. Reflexes… coordination… yes. I am… quite steady. I used to… dance, you know. Ballet. Many years ago. I am… careful. I do not want to… fall. Or… make a fool of myself. It is… important to be… dignified.
DOCTOR: Good. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Coordination is good, as you said. Your gait seems steady, though a little slower than expected. Alright, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for that. Now, I’m going to order some blood work. I’ll need to draw about two vials. It will check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a good baseline. And then we will do a quick cognitive assessment. It is just a short series of questions to test your memory and thinking skills. It won't be painful or embarrassing, I promise. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable. Two vials of blood… I can manage that. I am… not afraid of needles. And a cognitive assessment… yes. I want to… know what is happening. I understand it is… important. I am… a practical woman. I do not want to… delay this. Let us… proceed. When can we… do the blood work? And the assessment? I have… an appointment with my niece later today. I must… consider the timing.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can do the blood work right away. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. It will take about 15-20 minutes. And then, once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can also do the cognitive assessment now, if you're comfortable. It will take about 10-15 minutes. Given your appointment with your niece, let's do the blood work first, and then the assessment, if you feel up to it. That way, you have some time to rest before your appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds perfect. Blood work first, then the assessment. And… I will rest before my appointment with my niece. She is… very demanding. Always… asking questions. It is… exhausting. Very well. Let us… begin with the blood work. Lead the way, Doctor. I am… ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's go. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is very skilled and gentle. She'll take good care of you. Just a few more steps, and we’ll be there. Don't hesitate to let me or Sarah know if you feel uncomfortable at any point. We'll take things at your pace.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… appreciate your kindness. I am… a little nervous, but I trust you. I have always… been a strong woman. I can manage this. Just… a little nervous. It is… foolish, I know. But… needles.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Ms. Alvara. Many people feel anxious about needles. It's perfectly normal. And you are a strong woman, I can see that. We'll get through this together. Sarah, this is Ms. Alvara. She’s going to have a little blood work done. Sarah will explain the procedure to you. Just relax, and let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Very well. Please… explain the procedure to me. I want to… understand what is happening. I do not like… surprises. And… try to be… gentle, if possible. I have… delicate veins.
