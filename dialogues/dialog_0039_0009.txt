DOCTOR: Hi Delano, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… my sight. It’s been getting worse, steadily, over the last few months. Not a sudden thing, thankfully. Though, frankly, I find it rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your sight has been gradually worsening over the past few months. That is inconvenient, and we definitely want to figure out what's going on. Let me pull up your chart here… Delano Alcorta, age 52. Alright. Now, can you describe how it’s getting worse?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain to someone who presumably has good vision. Things aren't as sharp, you understand? More… fuzzy around the edges. And at night? Forget about it. Driving is becoming… problematic. Though I assure you, I am a very careful driver. It’s not as though I'm reckless.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a general blurring, loss of sharpness, and particularly noticeable difficulty at night… that’s a good start. It’s good you’re being careful about driving. Has this been happening in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm. Both, I believe. Though, perhaps… slightly worse in the left. It’s hard to say definitively, to be honest. I haven’t exactly been measuring it, Doctor. I simply know it’s… diminished. It’s frustrating, really. I always prided myself on my excellent eyesight.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, slightly worse in the left. That’s helpful. And you mentioned this has been gradual. Can you recall roughly when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep a log of my visual acuity. Sometime last year, I suppose. Maybe… spring? It’s all a bit of a blur, if you’ll pardon the expression. It wasn’t dramatic at first, just… a subtle lessening. Now, it's becoming rather noticeable, which is why I'm here, of course. I do dislike being inconvenienced.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly understandable. You don't need to keep a log! "Sometime last year" is a good starting point. And I appreciate you coming in before it becomes a bigger problem. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wouldn’t say I have any “conditions.” I've always been rather… robust. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, truthfully. But… my blood pressure was a little elevated at the dentist last year, if that’s what you're asking. Otherwise, perfectly healthy. A bit overweight, perhaps, but nothing serious. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure at the dentist last year, otherwise generally healthy. And you mentioned a bit of extra weight – do you know approximately what your weight is currently?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, must we delve into such… personal details? I suppose… around 130-135 pounds. It fluctuates, of course. I’m a tall man, you see – six foot two – so it’s not as noticeable as it would be on someone… less vertically endowed. I used to be much slimmer, back in my younger days. But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, 130-135 pounds, six foot two. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I prefer to avoid those things if at all possible. Unnatural concoctions, the lot of them. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. A bit of rest, a healthy diet… that’s all one needs. I haven’t taken a pill in… well, decades, I should think. I did have some eye drops once, years ago, for allergies, but that was… temporary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, and no significant medical history beyond slightly elevated blood pressure and past allergy eye drops. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to an examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not in my life. I used to work with plants, you see – quite a variety of them – and I never experienced any sort of… adverse effect. Though, I suppose I could be allergic to something and not know it. Is that possible? It seems unlikely, frankly. I’m a rather… resilient individual.
DOCTOR: It is possible, but if you haven't experienced any reactions before, that's good to know. Alright, so no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had problems with their vision, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… wasn’t very forthcoming with medical details. My mother passed when I was young, and my father… well, he wasn’t one for sharing personal information. I know my grandmother had some sort of… eye trouble, perhaps cataracts? But it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t involved in her care. My siblings… I haven’t spoken to them in years. So, frankly, I don’t know. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was something, though. It runs in families, doesn’t it? But I couldn’t tell you specifics. It's all rather vague.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Family history can be difficult to track down. Alright, so vague history of possible cataracts in grandmother. Okay, Delano, I'm going to take a look at your eyes now. I'll just need you to look straight ahead, and I'll shine a light into each eye. It won't be uncomfortable, but let me know if anything feels strange. It’ll allow me to assess the health of your retina and optic nerve. Can I proceed?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed. Though I must warn you, I’m rather sensitive to bright lights. And I do have a rather strong… aversion to things being near my eyes. But I trust your expertise, I suppose. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. I’ll keep the light as dim as possible. Just focus on that point on the wall, and try to relax. Okay, right eye… I’m seeing some mild drusen, which are small deposits under the retina. Nothing alarming at this stage, but we’ll want to monitor them. The optic nerve looks healthy, but there is some mild pallor. And the lens does show early signs of cataracts. Now, let's take a look at your left eye… Left eye… similar findings here. Drusen present, again mild, but present. The optic nerve shows a little more pallor than the right eye, which may explain the slightly worse vision you’ve noticed on this side. And the lens also shows early cataracts, comparable to the right eye. I'm also noting some mild cup-to-disc ratio asymmetry, which requires further investigation. Okay, that’s a quick look. Now I want to check your peripheral vision and assess your eye muscle function.
PATIENT: Drusen, pallor, cup-to-disc… it all sounds rather ominous, Doctor. Are you telling me I’m going blind? I have important things to do, you know. I can’t simply… lose my sight. What exactly does all of that mean? And what, pray tell, is peripheral vision? It all sounds terribly complicated.
DOCTOR: Whoa, hold on a moment, Delano. It doesn't mean you're going blind. It's good that we're catching these things early. Drusen are common age-related changes, and mild pallor can be a normal variation. The cup-to-disc ratio asymmetry just means we need to rule out any potential increase in eye pressure. Peripheral vision is simply your side vision – everything you can see without looking directly at it. I’m going to have you look straight ahead, and I’ll present some objects in your side vision to see if you can detect them. It’s a quick test to assess your overall visual field. It's important to remember these are just initial findings. We need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and determine the best course of action. Would you be open to a visual field test and potentially an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan?
PATIENT: OCT scan? Visual field test? It’s all so… technical. I suppose… if it’s necessary. Though I must confess, I’m not a fan of tests. They always seem to reveal something unpleasant. And I’m rather pressed for time, you know. But… if it will determine if I'm losing my sight, then very well. Just please, make it quick. And explain everything in… layman’s terms, if you would. I’m not a medical professional, Doctor. I simply want to preserve my vision, if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. A visual field test is quick and painless—you just look straight ahead and tell me when you see lights flashing in your peripheral vision. It helps us map out your entire visual field. An OCT scan is a bit more involved, but still non-invasive. It uses light waves to create detailed images of the layers of your retina. It will help us examine the drusen and optic nerve in greater detail and rule out any other underlying conditions. It takes about 10-15 minutes. Based on the initial exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of early glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration. These are both conditions that can lead to vision loss if left untreated, but they are very manageable with early detection and treatment. Let me schedule you for both tests. We have availability tomorrow afternoon. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Must it be so soon? I had planned to… well, it’s not important. Very well, tomorrow afternoon it is. But I insist on a detailed explanation of the results, Doctor. No medical jargon, if you please. And I expect you to outline all possible treatment options, clearly and concisely. I’m a rational man, and I prefer to be fully informed before making any decisions. And please, ensure the tests are as… swift as possible. I have commitments, you know. Very well, schedule the tests. But I'm not making any promises about treatment until I've thoroughly considered all the options.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Delano. I understand. I’ve scheduled you for both the visual field test and the OCT scan tomorrow afternoon. I’ll make sure to explain the results in plain language and discuss all possible treatment options with you. I’ll also make sure the tests are done as quickly as possible. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And remember, early detection is key. I’ll also provide you with a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive evaluation after we have the test results. Here’s some information about glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, just so you can familiarize yourself with the conditions. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at the moment. I suppose… I’ll have questions after the tests, once I’ve had a chance to… digest the results. And I trust you’ll be available to answer them. I do appreciate your… efficiency, though I confess I’m not particularly fond of tests. Very well, then. I believe that concludes our consultation for today. I shall see you tomorrow. .
DOCTOR: It was nice meeting you as well, Delano. I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. Have a good day.
