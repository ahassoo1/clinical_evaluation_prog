DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Mrs. Julie, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, honestly, it's rather inconvenient. I seem to be... losing things. My sight, mostly. And my hearing isn't what it used to be. It all came on so suddenly, you see. I have a very busy schedule, and this is terribly disruptive.
DOCTOR: Losing things… Yes. A rather vague complaint, but we shall proceed. By “losing things,” are we referring to misplacing personal items, or a decline in your… sensory perception?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. I just told you. My senses. It’s hardly vague. I can barely see a thing, and people are mumbling. It’s not as if I’m losing my car keys, though I wouldn’t put it past the help to misplace those. Honestly, the staff these days… But that's beside the point. My vision and hearing are failing, and I need to know what can be done about it. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Julie, age 66. We’ll need to ascertain the rapidity of this decline. Was it gradual, or, as you say, sudden?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the slightest idea! It wasn’t slow, that much I know. One day things were… adequate. The next, blurry. People were speaking normally, and then… mumbles. I don’t have time for a detailed timeline, you see. I have engagements. Important ones. Is there a test? Some sort of… fix?
DOCTOR: A “fix,” Mrs. Julie, is rarely that simple. We need information to determine the cause before considering treatment. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I recall. Just the… fading. Everything feels a bit… muffled, and the colours aren't as bright. I suppose I've been feeling rather fatigued lately, but that's likely just from all the social commitments. Honestly, Doctor, it’s probably nothing serious. Just… old age, perhaps? Though I do take very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a brief physical examination, then. Please, follow my pen with your eyes. And I will need you to cover one eye at a time. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I don't indulge in… common medications. A little something for a headache, perhaps, but nothing serious. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, Doctor. And please, do hurry. I have a luncheon scheduled. Though, I suppose this is important. Just… swiftly, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right. With your right eye covered… can you read the bottom line of this chart?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. It's just… a blur. Honestly, Doctor, is this some sort of joke? I can barely make out the largest letters, let alone anything smaller. I told you, my vision is failing. Are you even listening? This is quite frustrating, you know. I'm a very important woman, with important things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, with your left eye covered… can you read the top line?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s all the same. Blurry, indistinct… a haze. It’s perfectly clear that something is wrong. I don’t understand why I have to go through this charade. A simple diagnosis would be far more efficient. Can’t you just tell me what’s happening? Or prescribe something? I really don't have time for games.
DOCTOR: Right. It appears we have significant vision impairment in both eyes. Now, concerning your hearing… Can you describe the muffling?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. Everything sounds distant. Like someone is speaking through a thick curtain. It's rather irritating. People don't enunciate properly these days. It's probably their fault, not mine. I simply can't hear what they’re saying. It's a constant strain, honestly. Are you going to offer some solution or just interrogate me all afternoon? I have a charity gala next week, and I need to be able to hear the introductions.
DOCTOR: Right. Given the sudden onset and the bilateral nature of both symptoms, and your age… We will need to rule out some more serious causes. I’m referring you to an audiologist for a full hearing test and to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. It could be a number of things, Mrs. Julie. I'll prepare the referral forms now.
PATIENT: Referrals? Honestly, Doctor, more appointments? This is most inconvenient. Must I see everyone? I was hoping for a simple solution, not a parade of specialists. Very well. But please, make it quick. And ensure they understand I have a busy schedule. I simply haven't the time for endless delays. I suppose I’ll need to reschedule my luncheon. This is utterly disruptive. .
DOCTOR: The forms contain the contact information for specialists who can provide a thorough evaluation. The sooner you schedule the appointments, the better. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
