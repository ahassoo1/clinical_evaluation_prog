DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. I see you're here today, so could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, to be quick about it, I need a card to drive for… well, for ridesharing. Or a taxi, maybe. Whatever the official name is these days. It's for commercial driving, I believe. I just want to get it sorted, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sciarrotta. I understand you need a medical certification for commercial driving. That's perfectly alright. To complete that certification, I'll need to perform a thorough medical examination and review your health history. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I’m seventy, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. But I feel… reasonably good, for my age. I walk every day, try to eat okay – lots of fish, you know? I had a divorce a few years back, which was stressful, but I think I've mostly gotten over that now. I have Medicare, so I see doctors when I need to. No major complaints, really. Is there anything specific you want to know? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Ms. Sciarrotta. It’s excellent that you stay active and mindful of your health. And it's perfectly alright to take your time; I want to be sure we cover everything thoroughly. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… high blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication ever since. My regular doctor – Dr. Ito, in town – handles that. Nothing else, I don’t think. No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but that was… oh, maybe twenty years ago? Is that what you mean by lung problems? I don’t smoke, if that matters. I really try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Sciarrotta. Well-controlled hypertension is good. And no, pneumonia from twenty years ago doesn’t necessarily count as a current lung problem. Excellent that you've never smoked. Now, could you tell me about any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, naturally. And… oh, yes! A hysterectomy, many years ago. Probably thirty years ago now. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Small things, really. I haven't needed anything major done, thankfully. I’m fairly lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sciarrotta, that's good information. And it is good to be lucky! Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a bit complicated. My mother had… well, she had some kind of heart trouble, I think. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. She died when I was young. My father… he had high blood pressure, I believe, but lived to be quite old. My brother, he had… cancer, I think. Lung cancer, but he smoked, so it’s not really relevant, is it? It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. I wasn’t very close to my family.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sciarrotta. Family history can often be a bit hazy, and it's perfectly alright that you don't have a lot of details. Knowing about a history of heart trouble and cancer is helpful, even without specific details. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the medication for your high blood pressure, are you currently taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medicine. Amlodipine, I think it’s called. And… well, sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains. Nothing regular, just when I need it. And a multivitamin, just to be safe. That’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I try to get most of my nutrients from food.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sciarrotta, that's good to know. Amlodipine for hypertension, occasional ibuprofen, and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication… I’ve always been quite fortunate, in that regard. I remember as a child, my mother was always worried about allergies, but I never had any. So, no allergies, to the best of my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies is very good. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Let’s get it over with, shall we? I’d like to be finished as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. My schedule is… busy. Though, I suppose at seventy, everyone's schedule is busy with doctor's appointments!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sciarrotta. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today, but not significantly concerning. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m listening now… No wheezing or crackles noted. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion. Also, I’ll do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Though, I do hope it won’t take too long. I’m perfectly capable, you know. I walk every day! My reflexes are… fine. Strength is… adequate. Honestly, I don’t understand why I need all this. But if it’s necessary for the card… just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Ms. Sciarrotta. I'm simply ensuring everything is functioning as it should for safe driving. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and coordination are excellent. Everything appears to be functioning well. Now, one final step. I'd like to check your vision, if you don’t mind. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never have. My eyesight’s always been quite good, thankfully. Though, things are a bit blurry up close now, naturally. I can see the chart just fine, though. Just get it over with. I need to get back home. I have a fish to cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sciarrotta. Your distant vision is 20/30 in both eyes, and your near vision is 20/40. That’s within acceptable limits for commercial driving, although I would recommend considering glasses for reading and close-up work. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on my assessment, you are in good overall health and meet the basic medical requirements for a commercial driver's license. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and near vision, I recommend you follow up with Dr. Ito to discuss blood pressure management and consider a vision exam for updated glasses. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… reasonable. I already see Dr. Ito, so that’s not a problem. And I suppose glasses wouldn’t hurt. I've been putting things further away to read lately, so… alright. So, I get the card? Is that it? Can I go now? I really appreciate you being so efficient, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sciarrotta, you do get the card. I’ll complete the necessary medical form for you right now. Here you are. This form is valid for one year. As I mentioned, please follow up with Dr. Ito regarding your blood pressure and consider a vision exam. I'm glad I could help, and you're very welcome. Drive safely, Ms. Sciarrotta! If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Thank you, Doctor Reisig. That will be all. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sciarrotta. You have a good day as well, and please be careful. .
