DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my…going to the bathroom. Or, not going, really. It's difficult to start, you see? And it takes a while, even then. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And difficult to start, hm?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Like…it feels like I have to push a little more than usual. And sometimes it just…drips. Not a stream, just little drops. It's…uncomfortable, to say the least. It’s not painful, thankfully, just…annoying and a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” is…not a medical term, Ms. Yadao. But alright. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, I know, Doctor. I just…it's hard to describe! It wasn’t sudden, no. More like it slowly got worse over those few weeks. At first it was just a little hesitation, then it started taking longer, and now…well, now it's this. I do remember thinking it was just getting older, at first. But it hasn't gotten better.
DOCTOR: “Getting older” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Yadao. Do you experience any burning or discomfort during urination, apart from the difficulty initiating?
PATIENT: No, no burning. It doesn’t hurt while it’s happening, just the trouble getting it started, and then, you know, feeling like it doesn’t empty all the way sometimes. It’s…frustrating, really. I've always been very regular, you see. This is quite unusual for me.
DOCTOR: And how frequently are you urinating throughout the day, would you estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Usually, maybe four or five times a day? But lately, it feels like more. Not dramatically more, but I’m noticing I go a bit more often, even if it’s just a little bit each time. And I find myself getting up once during the night now, which I haven’t done in years. Perhaps twice, on a bad night.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes to your fluid intake?
PATIENT: No, not really. I drink about the same amount as always. Mostly water, sometimes tea. I do like a small glass of cherry juice with breakfast, but I’ve been having that for years too. I haven't started drinking more or less of anything recently, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small dose, 10 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for…oh, maybe five years now? It seems to be working alright, as far as I know. My doctor checks it regularly.
DOCTOR: Hm. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, really. And the doctor always asks before prescribing anything new, and I tell them I have no allergies. It’s always been that way. I am quite healthy, generally. Just this…bathroom issue, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Yadao, while I appreciate your…thoroughness, we need to proceed. I'm going to perform a quick physical exam. We'll start with your abdomen, then a quick neurological check. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam. Very well. I do hope it’s not too…uncomfortable. I suppose that’s the next step, then. Where is the examination table, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Right over there. If you'll just lie on your back, Ms. Yadao. I’ll need to palpate your abdomen, so please relax. I'm going to listen to your abdomen as well. Now, deep breaths. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. No palpable masses. I’m now going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No obvious neurological deficits. Alright. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. We need to rule out infection and assess your kidney function.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A urinalysis and a…basic what? I suppose that makes sense. Where will I…provide the sample? Do I need to bring a container, or will you have one here? And how long will it take to get the results, Doctor? I have a bit of a schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: A basic metabolic panel assesses your electrolyte levels and kidney function, Ms. Yadao. A standard procedure. The nurse will provide you with a container for the urinalysis. The collection room is just down the hall. As for the results, they usually take 24 to 48 hours. We will contact you with the findings. I strongly advise against delaying this. And frankly, Ms. Yadao, I doubt this will be a complex matter. It is likely just age-related changes. But we need to rule out other possibilities, of course.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. 24 to 48 hours. I suppose that's acceptable. I’ll go find the collection room. And you think it’s just…getting older? Well, I suppose that’s something. Still, it’s good to be sure. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go and do that now. Where is the nurse station? And is there anyone who can help me get back to the waiting room? It’s a bit of a walk, you see.
DOCTOR: The nurse station is just through that door. The nurse will assist you with the collection and can help you back to the waiting room. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of symptoms. And please, Ms. Yadao, try not to worry unduly. It is most likely a benign issue. Now, good day. .
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll go and find the nurse then. .
