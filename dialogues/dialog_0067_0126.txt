DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Christen. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and… well, hungry too, even after I’ve eaten. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome. I'd like to get it sorted, if possible, as I have a fair amount on my plate at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger, even after eating, for a few weeks now. That does sound bothersome, especially with a busy work schedule. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about that thirst?
PATIENT: Right. It’s… not just feeling a bit dry, Doctor. It’s like I can never quite quench it. I find myself drinking… a lot more water than usual, and even then, my mouth feels parched. And it’s not just water, either. I’ve been reaching for juice, anything really, just to get some moisture in. I suppose I could try to be more specific… I'm drinking at least three litres a day, maybe more. I haven't been keeping a strict tally, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, three litres a day, or more, and still feeling thirsty. That's quite a bit of fluid intake. And you mentioned reaching for juice as well. Have you noticed any changes in your urine output – are you going to the bathroom more often than usual, and if so, is it a large amount each time?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I am going to the bathroom… considerably more. And it’s… a fair amount each time, yes. I hadn’t really connected the two, to be frank. I just thought it was… the water, I suppose. It’s… clear, if that makes any difference. Not dark or cloudy. I don't know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Christen. Clear urine and increased frequency, along with the increased thirst and hunger… those symptoms together raise a few possibilities. Before we jump to conclusions, let's go through a bit more of your medical history. Have you had any past medical problems – anything at all that you've been treated for, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, a rather nasty bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but… that was a long time ago, and I recovered fully. Aside from that… nothing major, as far as I know. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I did have a divorce a few years back, which was… stressful, but I wouldn't classify that as a medical problem. I suppose I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing requiring serious treatment.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, pneumonia ten years ago, otherwise generally healthy. And you mentioned a stressful divorce. I appreciate you sharing that. Stress can certainly impact your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. A bit of paracetamol for headaches now and then, but that’s it. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I don’t really believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary, if you understand. I prefer to let my body sort itself out, where possible.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Christen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had any issues with pollen or animals or anything like that. I suppose I should clarify, though… I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but it’s just sneezing and a runny nose, nothing severe. I don't take anything for it, just try to avoid being outside too much when it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just mild seasonal hay fever. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Right. Well, my father had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother had diabetes, type 2, I think it was. She was diagnosed quite late in life, though, in her seventies. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other often, so I don't have much information. Nothing else springs to mind, to be honest. Not a particularly long-lived family, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with high blood pressure, mother with type 2 diabetes diagnosed later in life. That’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. This will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible, so please, proceed. I'll do my best to remain still. I confess, I'm not overly fond of hospitals, but I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to the touch. I'm going to ask you to step on the scale and tell me your height, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. One hundred and seventy centimetres, and… ninety-three kilograms, if that’s useful. I’ve put on a bit of weight recently, I’ll admit, but I’ve been meaning to get back to the gym. Work keeps me rather busy, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. Okay, 170 centimetres and 93 kilograms. Your BMI is 32.3, which puts you in the obese category. Given your symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, and your family history of diabetes, along with the elevated blood pressure and increased BMI, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your blood glucose levels – both fasting and A1C – to see how well your body is processing sugar. We'll also check your kidney function and electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking this seriously. I would be happy to have those tests done. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better, in my opinion. I’ll cooperate in any way I can. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? A fast, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is okay. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, so you can fast overnight. Does tomorrow morning at 9 AM work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, 9 AM tomorrow morning would be perfect, Doctor. Thank you for accommodating me. So, no food after… tonight, then? Just water. I can manage that. I suppose I should cancel my breakfast meeting, then. It’s a bit inconvenient, but worth it to get this sorted. Will I receive instructions on where to go for the blood draw, and how to prepare further?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll receive a text message with detailed instructions, including the lab location and specific instructions for fasting. It will also include a reminder of the appointment time. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend that you continue to drink plenty of water, but avoid sugary drinks like juice and soda. Also, while we wait for the test results, it would be beneficial to start thinking about making some small changes to your diet and exercise routine. Even small changes can make a big difference. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and explained everything very clearly. I understand the need for the tests, and I’ll follow your instructions regarding the fasting and lifestyle changes. I suppose I should refrain from self-diagnosing on the internet, then? It's a rather dangerous habit, I know. Thank you again for your time, and for taking my concerns seriously. I look forward to hearing from you once the results are available. I believe that concludes everything, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are absolutely right to avoid self-diagnosing online. It’s often more harmful than helpful. And you’re very welcome, Christen. I’m glad I could address your concerns. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are back, likely within a few days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – for example, if you become excessively thirsty, experience blurred vision, or feel unusually tired – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9 AM. Have a good rest of your day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before then.
PATIENT: .
