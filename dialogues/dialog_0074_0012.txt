DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information. They sent a form, and I thought it best to get a doctor to fill it out properly, you see. Just to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. That’s very prudent of you. Cruise lines often have those requirements to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all passengers. So, this form is primarily for pre-existing conditions and to confirm you are fit to travel. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing any doctors regularly, or have any ongoing health concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my late husband, God rest his soul, he always said I worried too much about my health. But no, not regularly, no. I’ve generally been quite… robust, if you take my meaning. Though, I did have a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but that cleared up with some exercises. Nothing ongoing now, truly. I wouldn’t say I’ve got any concerns, exactly. It’s more… remembering everything, you see. I’m 45, and things do start to… slip one’s mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Squiers. It's very common to experience some memory changes with age, and it's good you're aware of it. It's also wonderful to hear you’ve been generally healthy. Just to be thorough, when you say “memory lapses,” could you describe what that means for you?
PATIENT: Well, it's not… forgetting who people are, or anything frightening like that! It’s more… names, sometimes. Or where I put my glasses – though, as you can see, I’ve found those today! And little things like appointments, if I don’t write them down immediately. I used to be able to remember everything, perfectly. Dates, faces, all of it. Now… it just takes a bit more effort, you see. It doesn't happen often, thankfully. Just enough to make me double-check myself.
DOCTOR: I see. So, mainly difficulty with recall of recent events and names, rather than a more pervasive memory loss?
PATIENT: Precisely! You put it very nicely, Doctor. That’s exactly it. Recent things are the trickiest. Things that happened a long time ago, I remember like it was yesterday. But if someone tells me their name five minutes ago… well, I might need them to repeat it. It’s not a bother, really. I just prefer to be prepared. It’s good to be honest, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Squiers. Honesty is crucial, and it’s excellent you're so self-aware. Now, aside from the memory lapses, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing that I’ve noticed, anyway. I sleep soundly, I eat reasonably well – though I do have a fondness for shortbread, admittedly. No pain, no dizziness, no… well, you know, anything alarming. I feel quite well, all things considered. Perhaps a little tired sometimes, but who isn't, at our age? I walk regularly, you see. Keeps me moving. It’s just the memory that's… a little unreliable, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Ms. Squiers. Maintaining an active lifestyle is excellent. To get a better overall picture, would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Not at all. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement entirely. I always believed in a good thorough examination, my mother always said it was the only way to be sure. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Your gait appears steady, no noticeable abnormalities. I’m going to check your eyes as well. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Eye movements are full and coordinated. Now, just one more thing, a brief neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, I must say. And kind. I appreciate you taking your time. Go ahead with your questions, I'll do my best to answer them. I confess I feel a little silly being tested like this, but if it helps, then so be it.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Ms. Squiers. It’s standard practice to assess cognitive function when someone reports memory concerns. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s… August the 2nd. 2025, isn’t it? Yes, August the 2nd, 2025. I’m fairly certain of that. Though, you know, time does seem to… slip away these days.
DOCTOR: That’s correct, August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Please tell me the words, Doctor. I’ll try my very best to remember them. I used to be quite good at these sorts of things. It's the little everyday things that are tricky these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those. Apple, table, penny. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, and then I’ll come back to those three words. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Apple, table, penny. I’ve got them safely tucked away in my mind, I think. Though I do find myself repeating them under my breath just to be sure! Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready for your questions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. She answers correctly, although with some slight hesitation and requiring a moment to recall the president’s name. She struggles with this task, becoming easily distracted and unable to complete it accurately. Now, can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Oh, let me think… Apple… I remember apple, yes. And… hmm. Something with a ‘t’… table! Yes, table, that's right. But the third one… it's right on the tip of my tongue… it was something small… shiny… Oh, bother. I’m afraid I’ve forgotten the third word, Doctor. It's so frustrating! I know I heard it, but it's just… gone. It's like a little hole in my memory, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Squiers. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam I’ve performed, it seems you are experiencing some mild memory lapses, which could be related to normal aging. It doesn’t appear to be anything overly concerning at this time, but it’s something we should monitor. The struggles with the counting task are something to note.
PATIENT: Oh, that's a relief to hear it’s not something… serious, you understand. I was a little worried, if I’m being honest. Normal aging… well, I suppose that’s just part of life, isn’t it? And I am getting on a bit, now that I think about it. Monitor it, you say? What does that involve, Doctor? Would I need to come back for more tests? I’d rather not, if I can avoid it, you see. I’m not fond of hospitals, and all those… machines.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Squiers. You're not alone in disliking medical facilities. Monitoring involves periodic check-ups, perhaps every six months, to see if your memory lapses worsen or if you develop any new symptoms. We can repeat a similar cognitive assessment during those visits. At this time, I don’t think extensive testing, like an MRI or blood work, is necessary. However, if you do notice any significant changes – difficulty with everyday tasks, getting lost, personality changes – it would be important to let me know immediately. In the meantime, I recommend some lifestyle adjustments that can help maintain cognitive function: regular exercise, a healthy diet, staying socially active, and mental stimulation – puzzles, reading, learning new skills. And, importantly, getting enough sleep. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable indeed, Doctor. Periodic check-ups… I can manage that. And I do enjoy a good puzzle, though my daughter says I’m terrible at crosswords! And I certainly try to keep myself busy. Socially active… well, I have my book club, and I see my daughter and grandchildren whenever I can. Sleep… that’s usually not a problem, thankfully. I sleep like a log, as they say. So, six months then? And if I notice anything… worrying? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's very comforting to know what to expect. Now, about this cruise form… will you be able to fill that out for me? I do need to get it sent off soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help alleviate your concerns. Yes, of course, I can complete the cruise form for you. It primarily requires confirming your general health status and any pre-existing conditions, which we’ve already discussed. I’ll also include a note about the importance of staying hydrated and protecting yourself from the sun during your cruise. Just standard precautions. Here you are. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Everything looks quite correct, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Yes, staying hydrated is important… and the sun, certainly. My daughter is always telling me to wear a hat. No, I don’t think there’s anything else, thank you. You’ve been most kind and helpful. I truly appreciate your time and patience. Oh! Wait just a moment. I almost forgot! These are shortbread, Doctor. From a lovely little bakery in Edinburgh. A small thank you for your kindness. It’s the least I could do. They’re rather good, if you like shortbread.
DOCTOR: That is incredibly kind of you, Ms. Squiers. Thank you so much. I do enjoy a good shortbread, and this looks delicious. Well, enjoy your cruise! And please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day.
