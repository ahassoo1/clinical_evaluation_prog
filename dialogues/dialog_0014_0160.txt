DOCTOR: Well, hello Candis. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… weakness. And this strange thing I’ve been doing. I don’t even know why I’m telling you this, it’s embarrassing. But it's getting worse, and my niece insisted I come. Just get it over with, alright? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “getting it over with” isn’t really how we do things here, but I understand you’re… anxious. Let’s start with the weakness. Where are you feeling weak, exactly?
PATIENT: Everywhere! It's not like a specific muscle, just… drained. Like someone took all the energy out of me. And it’s been slowly getting worse for… oh, I don’t know, a couple of months now? Maybe longer. It's hard to keep track of these things, honestly. I just feel tired. And I have no patience for nonsense. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Drained," okay. And this… other thing you mentioned?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is awful. I… I’ve been eating dirt. Not big chunks, mind you. Just… little bits. Clay, mostly. From the garden. I know it sounds ridiculous! My niece nearly had a fit. She said something about iron deficiency, but I think she just reads too many internet articles. I haven’t been feeling well, so I just… started. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: You're eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Clay. Earth. Whatever you want to call it. Is it so shocking? It's… soothing, alright? And I haven't been able to stop. It started small, a little taste here and there, but now… well, now it’s a daily thing. Look, I don’t understand why I’m doing it, and frankly, I don’t want to analyze it to death. Just tell me what’s wrong and give me something to fix it. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright. This… behavior is unusual, to say the least. We need to rule out a few things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, other than this… craving?
PATIENT: Changes? Honestly, who pays attention to that? I eat when I’m hungry. Sometimes I don't. It's not like I've been refusing food or anything dramatic. Maybe I haven't been eating as much meat lately, but that's just because it's expensive, and it doesn't sit well. Does it matter? I just want to feel normal again. And please, let’s skip the endless questions, alright? I’m wasting my afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re frustrated, Candis, but I need information to help you. Okay, let’s try this. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Sometimes, yes. Not falling-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. Like when you stand up too fast. It happens every now and then, but I figured it was just my age. I haven’t been paying attention to whether it happens with… the other thing, if that's what you're getting at. Honestly, I don't catalog every little symptom. Do you have a solution or not?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little low, pulse is regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your mouth... open wide for me, please. Hmm. Your gums are a little pale, and there's some minor inflammation... and is that… clay residue?
PATIENT: Yes, probably. Look, I told you. It's not exactly a secret. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm being interrogated. Is this going to involve blood tests? Because I really don't like needles. And I don't have insurance, so… let's just try to get this over with quickly. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Blood tests are necessary, Candis. We need to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and a few other things to rule out some serious possibilities. Anemia, for one, could explain both the weakness and the… pica. And yes, I understand you don't have insurance. We can discuss options for financial assistance, but the tests are essential. I also want to check your thyroid function. Fatigue and pica can sometimes be linked to thyroid issues. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Do the tests. Just… get it over with, alright? And don’t expect me to be grateful. It’s your job. Financial assistance? What does that even mean? Will it take all day? I have errands, you know. And honestly, I don’t understand all this “thyroid” business. Just tell me what’s wrong and give me something to fix it. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Nurse, could you please draw Candis’s blood?
PATIENT: Wonderful. Just what I needed. Look, if I start feeling faint, don't bother. Just… leave me alone. And please, don’t make a fuss. I've had worse. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, the blood is drawn. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel as well, just to be thorough. And I will be frank with you Candis, this behavior is concerning, and could indicate a more serious underlying condition. It is crucial that we determine the cause, and follow up with appropriate treatment. Can you give me a list of all the medications that you are taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Honestly. I take… nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't believe in all those pills. I've always been healthy. Well, except for this… situation, of course. But that’s just a… quirk. And I told you, I don't have the patience for endless tests and probing. This whole thing is a waste of my time. Just call me when you have the results, alright? Don’t expect me to be thrilled. And if it’s something complicated, don’t bother. I’m not interested. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available. But I strongly advise you to follow up, Candis. Ignoring this won’t make it go away. And please, if you start experiencing any new or worsening symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Have a… good day. .
