DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it's about time someone looked into this. I've been dealing with it for… well, years now. Seems to get worse every summer. It's just… uncomfortable. Makes a man sweat like a… well, you get the picture. Not dignified. I used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Painting, mostly. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Years, you say. Okay. And this is specifically a reaction to heat – not just exertion, right?
PATIENT: Exertion? Of course it’s not just exertion! I'm a painter, a builder – I do things! It's the heat itself. Even sitting still, if it’s a hot day, I'm drenched. And it’s not like a normal sweat, you know? It’s… sticky. And I get lightheaded. Not fainting, just… wobbly. Honestly, doctor, I’ve always been a strong man. This is… new. Do you understand what I mean? It's not a normal discomfort.
DOCTOR: Sticky, you say…and lightheadedness. Alright. And has this affected your appetite at all?
PATIENT: Appetite? Now that you mention it… yes, actually. Not that I don't eat, but I don't feel like eating when it's scorching out. Everything seems… bland. I used to look forward to my lunch, a good daal bhat, after a morning of work. Now? I just pick at it. And I’ve definitely been drinking more water, but it doesn't seem to help much. It's all connected, isn't it? The heat, the sweat, the lack of hunger… It’s just a miserable feeling, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? Hmm. Nothing major, not that I recall. Had the usual childhood things, measles and such, back when they didn't bother with all those… vaccinations. Nothing serious, never been in hospital, thankfully. My blood pressure's been a bit high lately, the doctor at the clinic mentioned it a few times, but he just told me to watch my salt intake. I've been trying. And my knees ache sometimes, getting old, I suppose. But that’s it, really. A strong constitution, always have had one. Don’t even get me started on the younger generation though… all these aches and pains they complain about!
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure… and knee pain. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never. Absolutely not. I’ve always been careful, you see. Didn’t spend my life taking risks. And I believe in letting the body heal itself, if possible. A bit of rest, a bit of daal, and things usually sort themselves out. No need for poking and prodding, if you ask me. Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. My father always said, “Leave well enough alone.” And I’ve lived by that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father lived to be 85, strong as an ox until the very end. Heart trouble, eventually. My mother… she was always a bit frail, I suppose. Died young, complications after childbirth, back in Nepal. That's… a long time ago now. My brother is still alive, living in Kathmandu, but we don't speak much anymore. He's always been… delicate. Lots of complaints, always needing a doctor. Not like us.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the blood pressure pills, the ones the doctor at the clinic prescribed. A small blue one, I take it every morning. That’s it. I don’t like taking pills, never have. Always preferred a good herbal remedy, but the doctor insisted. Said it was important. Honestly, I don’t think it’s making much difference. They all seem the same to me, just making you feel… sluggish. Are you sure this heat intolerance isn't just… me getting old?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Before we get to potential causes, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I want to check your heart rate and blood pressure, listen to your lungs, and have a quick look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose. As long as it's quick. I have things to do, you know. Painting doesn’t do itself. But alright, go ahead. Just… be gentle. And don't poke too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your skin is warm and dry. No rashes or unusual findings. Any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, not really. Maybe a pound or two, but nothing significant. I've been eating alright, even if my appetite's been off. It's just… the heat makes you lose your energy, you know? Makes everything feel… draining. Honestly, doctor, I’m telling you, it’s the heat. I've lived a long life, I know my body. It's just… not coping with the summers like it used to. What do you think it is?
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your symptoms – heat intolerance, sticky sweat, lightheadedness, decreased appetite – and your medical history, a few things come to mind. Given your age and blood pressure, we need to rule out heat exhaustion or heat stroke, though you haven’t reported any confusion or loss of consciousness which is good. It could also be related to the medication you’re taking, or even a thyroid issue, as that can affect your body's ability to regulate temperature. However, given the long duration of these symptoms, it's important to consider rarer causes too. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a blood test. It will check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying infections. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood test… Honestly, doctor, you're making me nervous now. I knew I should have just stayed home and had a cup of chai. Rare causes? Infections? All this for a bit of heat? I just feel… unwell when it’s hot. Will it be a lot of blood? I don't like needles. And what if it shows something… serious? Are you sure it’s necessary? Maybe I should just try drinking more water… and staying in the shade.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your concern. It's not about assuming something serious, it's about being thorough. The blood test is a relatively simple procedure, just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. We'll only take what's necessary. It's the best way to rule things out and give you peace of mind. Look, I'm not going to dismiss your feelings. It could be nothing serious. But I have a duty to investigate and make sure we don’t miss anything. I'm going to order the tests now. And while we wait for the results, I'd also recommend scheduling an appointment with a cardiologist to get a more thorough assessment of your heart health, given your blood pressure. How does that sound?
