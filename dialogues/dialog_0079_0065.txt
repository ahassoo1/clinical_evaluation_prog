DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 41 years of age. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. I am Reneisha Selbitschka. It’s… well, it’s the weight. I’ve gained a rather significant amount, and I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It’s quite concerning, frankly.
DOCTOR: Concerning, you say. Hmm. And how long has this weight gain been occurring, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it began gradually, perhaps six months ago? It was subtle at first, just feeling a bit… snugger in my clothes. But over the last three months, it’s become quite noticeable. I’ve tried to ignore it, but it’s progressing, and my husband is becoming worried as well.
DOCTOR: Six months… progressing over the last three. And have you noticed any other changes accompanying this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really changes, exactly… but I have been feeling… more tired than usual. And a little bit… colder, even when the weather is warm. It’s difficult to explain. Just a general feeling of… sluggishness, I suppose. I’m usually quite active, helping my husband with the garden and such, but lately I just… don’t have the energy.
DOCTOR: Sluggishness and feeling colder… right. And has this tiredness or cold sensitivity interfered with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. I used to be able to work in the garden all day without a problem, but now I have to take frequent breaks. And even simple things, like walking up the stairs, leave me breathless. It’s… frustrating. My job as an orderly is physically demanding as well, and I’m worried it’s going to affect my ability to do it properly.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness… right. And, Ms. Selbitschka, have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is… normal, I think. I eat the same amount as always. Perhaps a little more comfort food lately, now that I think about it, but nothing drastic. My husband does most of the cooking, and it's always been hearty meals, nothing overly processed. I haven’t been deliberately eating more to compensate for anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing diagnosed, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, but nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized or had any surgeries. I do have a bit of trouble with my knees sometimes, getting older, you know, but nothing that requires a doctor. I try to keep up with it myself. I’ve always been… reluctant to bother the doctor unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Reluctant, you say. And is there any family history of… let me see… thyroid problems, diabetes, or significant weight gain in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother… she suffered from a rather bad thyroid condition when she was older. She gained a lot of weight very suddenly, and was always cold, even in the summer. She was eventually diagnosed, and had to take medication for the rest of her life. My father had some issues with his blood sugar, but it wasn't diabetes, the doctor said. More like… borderline. Nothing significant. He managed it with diet and exercise. I believe that's all, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for my knees, if they are particularly bothersome. I prefer natural remedies when possible, you see. My grandmother always had a good recipe for a poultice… But, other than that, no. Nothing regularly. I’ve always been wary of medication, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. No allergic reactions to anything I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully, and haven’t had any issues with insect bites or anything like that. I consider myself very lucky, really. Though lately, I've been wondering if my luck is finally running out, with all of this weight gain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, I think it's time we conduct a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your thyroid gland. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I just… I do hope it isn’t anything serious. This has been rather worrying, as you can imagine. I’m eager to find out what’s causing this, and if there’s something that can be done about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you would please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Let's get this over with, then. I hope I haven't put on too much weight. It's rather embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your weight is 83 kilograms, and your height is 155 centimeters. Your blood pressure is 130 over 85, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute. Now, if you’ll just lie down on the examination table, please. Your heart sounds regular, but slightly fast. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles detected. Now, I’m going to palpate your thyroid gland. Hmm. Your thyroid is slightly enlarged, and I feel a small nodule on the left lobe. It’s not particularly large, but it’s definitely present. I would like to order some blood tests to assess your thyroid function. We’ll need to check your TSH, T4, and T3 levels. We should also check your glucose and cholesterol levels, given your mother’s history. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. That’s… good. Blood tests, yes, absolutely. I just want to know what's going on. My mother’s thyroid… it’s worrying, naturally. A nodule… is that… bad? I’m perhaps being silly, asking so many questions. But if it's similar to what she experienced… is it treatable?
DOCTOR: A nodule does not automatically mean anything sinister, Ms. Selbitschka. Many nodules are benign. However, it’s essential to rule out any potential malignancy. The blood tests will give us a better understanding of your thyroid function and whether further investigation – such as an ultrasound or biopsy – is necessary. We’ll start with the blood work, and then proceed from there. I will also provide you with a requisition form for the lab. It is located just down the hall. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to prepare for the tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe I understand. Just down the hall… no special preparation. Right. Thank you. I… I suppose I should go then? And wait for the results? I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. And for ordering the tests. I just… I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Yes. Please go to the lab, and they will draw the necessary samples. The results typically take a few days to come back. Once I have them, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan, if necessary. Try not to worry excessively, Ms. Selbitschka. We will address this methodically. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I understand. Thank you again for your time and attention. I will go to the lab now. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you.
