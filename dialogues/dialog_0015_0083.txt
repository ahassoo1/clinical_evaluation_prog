DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… a little thing. I just thought, you know, a nice card would be… encouraging. I been feeling a bit… low, if you understand. Not sick, mind you. Just… low. A “Get Well” card is what I was hoping for. From a doctor, it means more, you see?
DOCTOR: A “Get Well” card… from me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Exactly. It’s… well, my daughter, she gets them for everything. A little cold, a bad day… a card from you would cheer me up. I don’t usually bother doctors with things like this, but… she said it might help. She's very thoughtful, my daughter.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. My role is to address medical concerns, not to provide emotional… support through greeting cards. While I appreciate your daughter’s thoughtfulness, this isn’t really something I… offer. Perhaps a visit with a therapist would be more appropriate if you are feeling “low,” as you put it?
PATIENT: A therapist? Now hold on just a minute. I don’t need a therapist! I just want a card. It's a small thing, Doctor. You write prescriptions all day, what’s one little card? I thought doctors were supposed to be… caring. This isn't about being sick, it's about… feeling better. Don't you understand?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I do understand that you are requesting something outside the scope of medical practice. And frankly, it's a rather… unusual request. While I strive to be empathetic, providing a “Get Well” card based on a vague feeling of being “low” diminishes the seriousness of actual medical needs. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – fatigue, changes in appetite, difficulty sleeping, loss of interest in activities?
PATIENT: Specific symptoms? No, not really. Just… low. Like the air is a bit heavy, you know? And things don’t… sparkle as much. My daughter, she said a card would remind me things can sparkle again. You make it sound like I’m making it up, Doctor! I worked hard my whole life, running boilers, keeping things going. It’s not easy, you know. A little kindness wouldn’t kill you.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I assure you I am not attempting to invalidate your feelings. However, describing a general sense of… diminished sparkle is not a diagnosis. Are you currently under the care of any other physicians?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just you. And before this… this whole card business, I was perfectly fine. A little tired, maybe, getting older, but who isn’t? I don't need treatment, I just… wanted a little something to lift my spirits. It’s just a card! It’s not like I’m asking for a new heart or anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am going to ask you directly. Are you experiencing any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Harm myself?! Now you’re being ridiculous! What kind of question is that? I’m a practical man, Doctor. I fix things, I don’t… fall apart. A card is what I want. You make it sound like I’m… unstable. This is getting very insulting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I asked that question because a change in mood, even one described as simply “feeling low,” can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, including depression. And while I understand your frustration, demanding a “Get Well” card is not a reasonable request within a medical setting. I am concerned about your well-being, and I would like to ask about your family history. Have any of your close relatives experienced any mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: My family? Now you're digging into my family? That’s… personal, Doctor. And frankly, it's none of your business. My mother was a strong woman, never complained a day in her life. My father worked hard, same as me. They didn't need doctors poking around in their feelings. I just want a card! Is that so much to ask? You write prescriptions for everything, a little ink and paper won't hurt you.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am going to state this one final time. I am a physician, and my responsibility is to provide medical care, not to fulfill personal requests. I understand you are feeling “low,” but demanding a greeting card is not a productive way to address that feeling. If you are unwilling to discuss potential underlying medical causes for your mood, I am unable to assist you further. I suggest you consider seeking support from a qualified mental health professional. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine! Fine, you know what? I don't need your help! I came here for a simple thing, a little kindness, and you treat me like I'm… crazy! I'm wasting my time. You and your fancy degrees… you've forgotten what people actually need. I'll find someone else. Someone with a little compassion.
