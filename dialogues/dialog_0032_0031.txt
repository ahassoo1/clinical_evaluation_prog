DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pipkorn. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my left leg… it's gotten quite swollen. And the nurse mentioned something about my heart… a funny beat, she said. I've been feeling alright mostly, but this leg is worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: I see. Swelling in the left leg, and the nurse noted an irregular heartbeat. Alright. Let's start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, barely noticeable. But it's gotten worse each day, I’d say. I thought maybe I just stood too long, but it hasn't gone down. It’s quite painful now, too. Especially at my ankle.
DOCTOR: A week ago, progressively worsening, with pain, especially at the ankle. Has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hm… that's a good question. I don't think so, not really. Restin’ it doesn’t seem to help much, and walkin’ doesn’t seem to make it worse, exactly… just uncomfortable. It's fairly constant, the discomfort. I've tried elevatin’ it a bit, but that didn't do much either, to be honest. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Constant discomfort, no relief with rest or elevation. And you mentioned you've noticed a funny beat... are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: Well, not that I've noticed, no. I feel a little… tired, maybe? But I’ve been a bit run down lately with school, so I thought that was just that. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness or anything. Just… a funny beat now and then, and the tiredness. Is that… bad? I don’t really understand what it means.
DOCTOR: Fatigue alongside an irregular heartbeat does warrant some investigation, though it doesn’t automatically indicate a serious issue. Let's move on to some more general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse said something about… atrial fibrillation, she called it. That’s why she mentioned the heart. I saw a doctor about it a couple of years ago, but he didn’t really… treat it, exactly. Just told me to watch out for things and come back if it got worse. I haven't seen anyone about it since, to be honest. Apart from that, nothin’ major. Just the usual scrapes and colds.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation diagnosed previously, but no active treatment, just monitoring. Very good to know. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. And no surgeries either. I've been fairly lucky, I suppose. I broke my arm once when I was wee, but that was just a cast and a bit of a nuisance. Nothin’ serious. Just the atrial fibrillation the doctor told me about a while back. It hasn’t bothered me much until now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky one. My mum… she had high blood pressure, I think? And my grandad on my dad's side, he had something with his heart, but I don’t remember exactly what. He passed away when I was quite young. I don't really know much beyond that, to be honest. My family doesn’t talk about health much. It's a bit of a taboo subject, really. Does that help?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother, cardiac issues in your grandfather… it’s helpful information, even if it’s limited. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. A glass of wine at Christmas, maybe? And certainly no drugs. I’m a student, I haven’t got time for all that! I spend most of my time studyin’, to be honest. A quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, minimal alcohol use. Good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I don’t really like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Just the usual paracetamol for a headache, maybe, but that’s it. I haven’t needed anythin’ regular. Just try to get a good night’s sleep when I can. It's hard, with studyin’, but I do my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kreckel. Thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I'd like to conduct a physical examination. Specifically, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to examine your left leg to assess the swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever I need to help figure this out. Just… be gentle with my leg, please? It's quite tender.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart. Please lie back on the examination table. Take a deep breath… and another… Good. I do hear an irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation, as previously diagnosed. It’s moderately fast, but not immediately alarming. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s examine your leg. Please point to where it’s most tender. Alright. There is significant tenderness and warmth to palpation. I also notice pitting edema extending to the mid-calf. Left calf circumference is 38 centimeters, right calf circumference is 34 centimeters. There’s a clear difference in size. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but diminished on the left foot compared to the right. Posterior tibial pulse is palpable, but also weaker on the left. There is evidence of significant swelling, warmth, tenderness, and diminished pulses in your left leg. This is concerning for a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT.
PATIENT: DVT? That sounds… serious. What does that mean? And what happens now? Is something wrong with my heart? Will I… will I be alright? I’m gettin’ a bit worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is serious, Ms. Kreckel, you are right to be concerned, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the worst. A deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot that has formed in a deep vein, in this case, in your left leg. That's why your leg is swollen, warm and painful. The diminished pulses also indicate it’s affecting blood flow. Now, regarding your heart, the atrial fibrillation can contribute to the risk of forming blood clots, but we need to determine if this DVT is directly related, or a separate issue. To be certain, we need to confirm the diagnosis with an imaging test – a duplex ultrasound of your left leg. This will visualize the vein and identify any clots. Given your symptoms and examination findings, I am going to order that immediately. Furthermore, because of the irregular heartbeat and the potential for a pulmonary embolism – a clot traveling to your lungs – I recommend we also get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. We will need to rule out any immediate risks. I'm going to order blood work as well to assess your overall health and clotting factors. We’re going to take things one step at a time, Ms. Kreckel. The important thing is to get a definitive diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment if needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Pulmonary embolism… that sounds very scary. So, you’re saying this could go to my lungs? And you’ll do all these tests… how long will that take? And what kind of treatment are we talkin’ about? I… I haven't got a lot of money, Doctor. I’m a student, and I don’t have insurance. Will this be very expensive? I’m gettin’ quite worried now. I just want to know what’s happenin’ and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: You are right to be worried, and I understand your concerns about cost. A pulmonary embolism, or PE, is when a blood clot travels from your leg to your lungs. It can be life-threatening, which is why it’s so important we rule it out, or address it immediately if present. Now, regarding the tests, the ultrasound can be done relatively quickly, usually within the hour. The EKG is also fast – just a few minutes. The blood work will take a bit longer – results usually come back within a few hours. As for the cost, I understand you are uninsured, and that is a valid concern. I will speak with our billing department to see what options are available to you. We can explore potential financial assistance programs or payment plans. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make this manageable. If the ultrasound confirms a DVT, the standard treatment is anticoagulation – blood thinners – to prevent the clot from growing and to prevent new clots from forming. These medications can be expensive, and there are different options available. We can discuss which one is most appropriate for you, taking your financial situation into account. If it's confirmed, we will also likely need to see a hematologist - a blood specialist - for long-term management. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I will send you to radiology for the ultrasound immediately. After that, we will discuss the EKG and blood work. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Yes, let’s do the tests. I’d rather just get it over with, to be honest. If it's about my heart, and my leg, I want to know what’s happenin’. And… and thank you for lookin’ into the money. That makes me feel a bit better, to know you’ll help with that. Where do I go for this… ultrasound? And should I walk there, or… would it be better to take a taxi? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kreckel. We will get this sorted out. I’ve just sent the order to radiology. They are located on the second floor, Room 207. Here is the request form . Now, regarding getting there, I would strongly advise against walking. Given your symptoms and the possibility of a DVT, any exertion could potentially dislodge the clot. I’m going to write you a note for a taxi, covered by the clinic. . Please, take the taxi directly to radiology, and tell them you are here for a DVT ultrasound ordered by Dr. Pipkorn. After the ultrasound, they will send the results directly to me. Once I have the results, I will contact you immediately to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… a taxi. Right. Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I think that’s… I think that’s all I need to know for now. I’m a bit scared, but I feel better knowin’ you’re helpin’. I’ll go and get a taxi, then. And I’ll wait to hear from you. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kreckel. Please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms – increased pain, swelling, shortness of breath, or chest pain – while you wait. We're here for you. Take care, and I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. .
