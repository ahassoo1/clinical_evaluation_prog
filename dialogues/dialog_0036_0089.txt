DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Oh, dear… what does bring me in? Let me see… it's this pain, really. Down low, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, it’s quite… troublesome. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… well, a condition I have. Lupus, was it? It’s all a bit foggy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal pain that comes and goes, and you mentioned a history of lupus. I understand it can be a bit foggy remembering everything. That's perfectly alright; we’ll sort it out together. Could you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor, that’s very kind of you. Yes, “foggy” is a good word for it. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… cramping, I suppose. And a heavy feeling. It doesn’t come every day, not at all. Sometimes weeks go by where I don’t notice it. But lately… it’s been more frequent, and a little stronger, if that makes sense. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything I eat, or any particular activity. Which is… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cramping and a heavy feeling, more frequent lately, and not obviously related to diet or activity. That is a little concerning when it’s a change from your usual pattern. When you say “lately,” about how long has it been happening more frequently?
PATIENT: Hmm… “lately.” Let me think… It feels like… perhaps since the beginning of June? Yes, I believe so. Around then, I started noticing it more regularly. Before that, it was just… an occasional discomfort. Nothing I needed to bother a doctor about, you understand. But in June it started to be almost every other day, and now… well, most days. I do apologize for being so vague; my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s important to give me as much information as you can recall, and it’s perfectly normal for details to be a little fuzzy. So, starting in June, the pain became more frequent, happening almost every other day, and now most days. Is the pain constant when it’s there, or does it come and go throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes throughout the day. It isn't a constant ache, thankfully. It’ll flare up, and be quite bothersome for an hour or two, perhaps. Then it’ll subside, and I’ll feel almost normal again. And then, later, it returns. It’s… unpredictable, really. I’ve tried to keep track, but it doesn’t seem to follow a pattern. It’s not linked to the time of day, or anything like that. Just… random bursts of discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable bursts of discomfort throughout the day. That helps. Now, regarding your lupus – do you currently see a rheumatologist for management of that condition?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist… yes, that’s the specialist, isn’t it? Oh dear, you’re asking me to remember names and doctors… Let me think… I used to, yes. Dr. Abernathy, I believe. A very nice woman. But… I haven’t seen her in… well, it’s been a while. Perhaps a year? Longer? I’ve been managing, or thought I was managing, on my own. Just with some over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. I suppose I should have kept up with the appointments, but… life gets in the way, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does, Ms. Glymph. No need to apologize. It's good you were managing for a time, but it's important to revisit specialists when things change. A year is a bit of time to be without follow-up for lupus, especially with these new abdominal symptoms. Just to be thorough, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, you are quite right, Doctor. I really should have kept up with it. It just… slipped my mind, I suppose. As for other symptoms… Let me see. Well, I’ve been a bit more tired lately. But then, who isn’t? And my joints ache sometimes, but that’s… fairly normal for me, I think. It comes and goes. Nothing dramatic. No fever, no rash… No, I can’t think of anything else, really. Just the tiredness and the joint aches, and this troublesome pain. It’s all rather… unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased tiredness and joint aches along with the pain. I appreciate you letting me know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently feel around to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment entirely. Just… be gentle, if you would? My old bones aren’t as sturdy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I will be very gentle. Okay. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now, which sound normal. I am palpating your abdomen... There's some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, primarily on the left side. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen isn't distended. Based on your history and this initial exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your pain. Given your history of lupus and the recent change in your symptoms, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to a lupus flare, or something else entirely. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an inflammatory marker like a C-reactive protein and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We'll also check a urinalysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, that would be alright. If it helps to get to the bottom of things, I’m happy to have the tests. Lupus flare… that sounds… unpleasant. I do hope it isn’t that. But I suppose it’s best to know one way or another. Urinalysis… is that to check for infection? I haven’t noticed anything… unusual, but then, I don’t always pay close attention to such things.
DOCTOR: Yes, the urinalysis is partly to check for infection, but also to look for any signs of kidney involvement, which can sometimes happen with lupus. It's a good general screening test. Okay, I’m ordering those tests now. They’ll be sent to the lab, and you should receive a call within a day or two to schedule a time to come back for the results. In the meantime, if you experience a high fever, severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or any blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. A high fever… severe pain… yes, I’ll remember that. I suppose it's best to be cautious. I do appreciate your thoroughness. It’s… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. That’s my job, and I take it very seriously. I understand your worry, and we'll get to the bottom of this together. Given your recent change in symptoms and the fact that you haven’t seen your rheumatologist in some time, I also recommend scheduling an appointment with Dr. Abernathy. It would be good to get her input on this situation. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… remarkably helpful, Doctor. Yes, please. If you wouldn’t mind providing a referral to Dr. Abernathy, I would be very grateful. I suppose I should have thought of that myself, but… my mind isn’t what it used to be. Thank you for reminding me. It’s… a weight off my shoulders, knowing you’re thinking of everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m happy to help. Here’s the referral information for Dr. Abernathy. It includes her contact information and a brief summary of your symptoms. Her office will likely call you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor. This is… wonderful. I’ll call her office first thing tomorrow. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I… truly appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It was my pleasure to meet you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Abernathy. And please, don't hesitate to go to the emergency room if you experience any of those concerning symptoms we discussed. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again when your lab results are back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I feel much better already, knowing I'm in good hands. I will call Dr. Abernathy's office tomorrow, and I will be sure to contact you when my results are back. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. You have a good day as well. Please take care. .
