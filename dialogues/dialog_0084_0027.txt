DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's this…stuff. Coming up. All the time. Really unpleasant. It's been happening for weeks, maybe months, I don't keep good track of these things. It’s just…regurgitation, I guess you’d call it. My wife kept telling me to come in, said I was looking peaked. Honestly, I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing frequent regurgitation, and it's been going on for weeks, possibly months. You said it's unpleasant and you’ve noticed looking unwell. “Peaked,” your wife mentioned. Let's try to get a better understanding of this. First, can you describe what this “stuff” looks like?
PATIENT: Look, it’s…food. Undigested food. Sometimes it’s like…sauce, you know? If I had spaghetti, it’ll be spaghetti sauce. Other times just…chunks. It doesn't smell bad, exactly, but it's…not pleasant to look at, either. It just…comes back up. Usually after I eat, but sometimes even if I just drink something too fast. It's embarrassing, frankly. I haven’t told many people about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so undigested food, sometimes resembling what you recently ate – like spaghetti sauce – and sometimes just chunks. It happens after eating, and occasionally even with drinking too quickly. And you said it’s embarrassing. Does this happen with every meal, or is it more intermittent?
PATIENT: No, not every meal. Thank goodness for that. More…when I eat something rich, I suppose. Creamy sauces. Spicy things. Big portions. My wife makes a lovely kielbasa, but…well, let's just say it doesn't always stay down. It’s usually after I lie down, too. If I eat a big meal and then try to relax in front of the television... that's when it's most likely to happen. It’s really a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s triggered by richer, spicier foods, larger portions, and lying down after eating. That's helpful information. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this – heartburn, nausea, bloating, a sour taste in your mouth, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Heartburn, yes, sometimes. A bit of a burning sensation in my chest. Not all the time, but frequently. Nausea? Not really. I wouldn't say I feel sick, just…uncomfortable. And, now that you mention it, a sour taste. Yes, definitely a sour taste sometimes after…well, you know. Bloating, no, not particularly. I'm a fairly thin man, as you can see. I don't carry much extra weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heartburn is common, you experience a sour taste after the regurgitation, but no nausea or significant bloating. And you've maintained a stable weight. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your esophagus or stomach?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been a healthy man. Blood pressure’s always been good, as far as I know. My wife handles the doctor appointments usually, but she hasn't mentioned anything about any problems. I've never had any trouble with my stomach, never needed an endoscopy or anything like that. I eat a good diet, mostly. Well, when my wife isn't making the meals, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, no history of esophageal or stomach problems. That's good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never broken a bone, never needed an appendix removed, nothing. I’m a remarkably durable man, frankly. My wife says I’m too stubborn to admit when something’s wrong, but that’s beside the point. Honestly, I just want to know what's causing this and how to fix it. I don't have time for a lot of tests and procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your desire to get this resolved quickly. No surgeries, that’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family – has anyone else in your family experienced similar symptoms, like heartburn, acid reflux, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, now that you mention it…she had something. Always complaining about heartburn. Took a lot of chalky tablets for it. But that was a long time ago, and she never went to the doctor much. Just…suffered through it. My father was a hearty man, never had a complaint in his life. So, maybe my mother? It was a long time ago, I don't remember the specifics. She’s been gone for twenty years, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heartburn in your mother, but no other significant family history. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't believe in filling my body with pills unless absolutely necessary. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. My wife tries to get me to take something for my cholesterol, but I refuse. I eat a good diet, mostly. I’ve always been a healthy man. Really. I don't need a lot of medication.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just occasional multivitamins. And you’ve maintained a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. Now, let’s quickly review any allergies you might have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, everything. I've always been a robust man. My wife worries about everything, but I’m perfectly fine. No allergies, no sensitivities, nothing. I’m a very simple case, I assure you. Is this almost over? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Altine, based on what you've told me – the regurgitation of undigested food, particularly after rich or spicy meals and when lying down, along with the occasional heartburn and sour taste – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, or GERD. It's a common condition where stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing these symptoms. The fact that you don’t have significant weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or any bleeding is reassuring. However, to confirm this and rule out anything more serious, I would like to order a few tests. A simple endoscopy to look at your esophagus and stomach lining would be the most informative. We can also do some pH monitoring to see how much acid is refluxing. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests? Look, I told you I don’t have time for tests. An endoscopy? That sounds…unpleasant. And pH monitoring? I don't even know what that entails. I came in here expecting a prescription, maybe some advice about what to eat. Not a bunch of invasive procedures. Frankly, I'm starting to regret coming in at all. Is there anything else I can do? Anything at all? Before we start sticking things down my throat?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I apologize if I've caused any alarm. I want to assure you, my goal is to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. We can try a trial of medication first, if you prefer. A proton pump inhibitor, like omeprazole, can help reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. We would start with a low dose, and see if it alleviates your symptoms. However, I need to emphasize that without a proper diagnosis, we're just treating symptoms, and we could be missing something more serious. If the medication doesn’t improve your symptoms within a couple of weeks, or if they worsen, then I would strongly recommend the endoscopy. Would you be willing to try the medication first?
PATIENT: Fine. Medication. A pill. I can handle a pill. But if it doesn't work, I'm not doing any of those…endoscopies. And I don’t want to be coming back here constantly. Just give me the pill, tell me what to do, and let’s be done with it. I have a meeting. And frankly, this conversation is making my heartburn worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I’m prescribing omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, in the morning, for two weeks. Take it with breakfast, preferably at least 30 minutes before you eat. I also recommend making some lifestyle changes. Avoid large meals, especially before bedtime. Stay upright for at least two to three hours after eating. Avoid foods that trigger your symptoms – spicy foods, fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, and carbonated beverages. If your symptoms don’t improve within two weeks, or if they worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll discuss further testing. And I will put in a referral for an endoscopy now, so if you change your mind, or things don't get better, you’re already in the system. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you. I guess. I need to go. And please, don't call me unless absolutely necessary. I’m a busy man. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. Peaked… stubborn… busy man… .
