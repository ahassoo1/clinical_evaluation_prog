DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Right. Well, to be honest, it’s… a bit embarrassing. My wife thought it was a good idea I get checked for… you know… the HIV thing. Just to be safe, she says. I don’t really see the point, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. It's really responsible of both of you to consider this, and honestly, getting tested is a very common and smart thing to do. It's definitely not embarrassing, and I appreciate you being open with me. Just to clarify, are you concerned about a possible exposure?
PATIENT: Exposure? No, not really. I mean, I’ve been married for ten years. She just… reads a lot of articles online, you know? And gets worried about everything. Honestly, I think she watches too much TV. It's just… a precaution, she says. A completely unnecessary precaution, if you ask me. But, alright, here I am getting poked and prodded. What exactly is involved, anyway?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to be proactive, even if it's just for peace of mind, and it sounds like your wife is very conscientious about your health. It's good she encourages you to be as well. So, the testing for HIV is pretty straightforward. We can do a blood test, which is the most common and accurate way to detect the virus. It looks for antibodies your body makes to fight the virus, or the virus itself. We can also do an oral swab, which is less invasive, but might not be as accurate right away. Before we decide which test to do, I'd like to ask a few questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall risk factors. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Honestly, this is getting a bit ridiculous. I just told you, I’ve been married for ten years! What sort of ‘risk factors’ are you expecting me to have? I’m not… I mean, it’s just a waste of time, really. But fine, ask your questions. I suppose. Just so we can get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I'm making you feel uncomfortable. I'm not trying to pry, and I assure you I'm not making any assumptions. The questions are just standard procedure for any medical test, and they help me ensure we're doing the right test for you, and interpreting the results correctly. Let’s start with this: Have you ever shared needles with anyone, even for things like tattoos or piercings?
PATIENT: Needles? Good heavens, no! I wouldn’t dream of it. Where do you think I am, some sort of… delinquent? I get my hair cut, and my wife gets the occasional manicure. Perfectly normal things. This is… insulting, frankly. Are you suggesting I have a… a hidden life? I can assure you, my life is very, very boring.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Jacquille. That was not my intention at all, and I’m very sorry if I’ve offended you. You are absolutely right to be upset, and I’m not questioning your lifestyle in any way. Those were simply routine questions. Let me rephrase. Have you ever received any blood transfusions or organ transplants?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No. Never. Organ transplants? Absolutely not. Look, I'm a perfectly healthy man. I eat my vegetables, I get enough sleep, I don't go around sharing needles with… whoever you thought I was sharing them with. This is all a complete waste of time. Just take the blood and tell me I’m fine. That’s all I want. Honestly, this is stressing me out more than the possibility of… whatever it is you're testing for.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you, and I’m truly sorry for the way this is going. I’ll stop with the questions for now. To be clear, we can go ahead and do the blood test, just for peace of mind. It’s a simple procedure, and it’s a standard precaution. If you'd prefer, we can also discuss the oral swab, though, as I mentioned, it might take a little longer to get results. Before we proceed, are there any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, or any medications you currently take?
PATIENT: Right. Just get it over with. Blood test. The sooner this is done, the better. As for medical conditions… I had a bad back a few years ago, but that cleared up. And I take a multivitamin. That’s it. Nothing else. Honestly, I’m remarkably healthy. I just… my wife worries too much. This whole thing is ridiculous. Can we just… do the test now? I have a golf game later.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jacquille. Blood test it is. And I understand you have a golf game later, so we'll try to be as quick as possible. If you'll just have a seat here, the phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the blood. It will only take a few minutes. While we wait, I'll document the information we've discussed – the negative history for risk factors, your back issue, and the multivitamin. And I'll make a note of your wife’s concerns, so we can address those results and provide reassurance when they come back. Do you have any questions for me while we wait?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get on with it. Honestly, this is giving me a headache. My wife will be thrilled I'm finally doing this, though. She's been on about it for weeks. It's just… all so unnecessary. Can I at least have a glass of water? My mouth's dry. And tell the person doing the blood draw to be gentle, alright? I don't like needles. At all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll get a glass of water for you right away, and I've already requested a gentle phlebotomist. They are very experienced and will do their best to make you comfortable. While we wait, just to be clear, do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials that might be used during the blood draw?
PATIENT: Latex? No. Not that I know of. I've had plenty of gloves on at the supermarket, handling fruit and vegetables, and I've never had a reaction. Honestly, I'm a perfectly ordinary man. No allergies, no… hidden habits, no need for all this… scrutiny. Just a glass of water, please. And let's get this over with. My golf game is starting soon. I'm a member at the Willow Creek club, you know. Quite a prestigious place.
DOCTOR: Willow Creek, that's excellent! I've heard good things. Here you are. And don't worry, we'll have you in and out of here quickly. I've just spoken with the phlebotomist, and they are ready for you now. They'll explain the procedure and make sure you are as comfortable as possible. They're just outside. We’ll get these results back to you as soon as possible. Do you have a preferred method of contact – phone or email?
PATIENT: Email is fine. jacquille.belan@email.com. And honestly, just tell me I'm fine. That’s all I need to know. No need for lengthy explanations or… concern. I’m a healthy man. My wife just… worries. You understand. Can we just get this over with now? I have a tee time in two hours. And I don’t like being late. It’s terribly impolite.
DOCTOR: Okay, jacquille.belan@email.com. I've got it. And we will certainly let you know the results as quickly as possible. The phlebotomist is waiting for you. They’ll take very good care of you. Just let them know if you have any concerns. I'll leave you to it, and I'll be here to review the results with you when they come back. Have a good tee time! .
