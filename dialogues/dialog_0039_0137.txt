DOCTOR: Hello Lindra, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need… check first. For… live there. Is good place, he say.
DOCTOR: So, your son brought you in for an evaluation, to see if a senior living facility might be a good fit for you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. He worry about me. I live alone now, you know? My husband… he gone two year. He good man. But… now just me. And son, he busy with work and babies. Is… hard for him. He think this place… help.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your son to be looking into options to help you, and it sounds like you’ve been through a lot lately losing your husband. We'll do a thorough check-up today just to make sure you’re in good health and see what kind of support might be helpful. Before we get started, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: What you mean, “going on”? I… I feel old, sometimes. My knees, they hurt when I walk too much. And I forget things… small things. Like where I put my glasses. But mostly I okay. I cook, I clean… I watch my stories.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Knee pain and a little forgetfulness are common as we get older. It's good that you're still able to manage things around the house and enjoy your stories. Let's talk a little more about those knees. When did the pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time now. Maybe… five years? It start slow. Just a little ache after I walk to the store. Now… it hurt more. Especially when it is cold. And going up the stairs… That is hard now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about five years of gradual onset, worse with activity and in the cold. Do you notice any swelling or stiffness in your knees, or does it hurt more at a certain time of day?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes. When I walk a lot. Not always. And stiffness… yes, in the morning. Is hard to move when I first get up. Like… old lady knees.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you might have some arthritis in your knees, which is very common. We can do a quick exam to check that out. Before we do that, are you experiencing any other pain anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Arth… what? Is that bad? No, no other pain. Just the knees. Sometimes my back… a little ache. But not much. I think is from bending over to clean. Old lady things.
DOCTOR: Arthritis just means inflammation of the joints. It's very common and we have ways to manage it. It doesn't necessarily mean it's "bad," but it's good we're checking it out. And a little back ache from cleaning is understandable! Now, let’s take a look at those knees and back. Could you please sit on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Exam table… yes. Is cold!
DOCTOR: It is a little chilly, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes. Always cold in doctor place. You going to… poke me now? My son, he say you poke and look.
DOCTOR: That’s a good way to put it! I'm just going to gently feel around your knees and back to see what’s going on. It shouldn't hurt, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I’ll just take a look at your knees while you’re sitting. Could you straighten your legs out in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay. Straighten… like this? Is okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect! I'm just looking at the alignment of your knees and checking for any swelling or redness. I'm noting some mild swelling on both knees, but no significant redness. Your knees do appear to have a slight inward bend. And there’s a little tenderness when I press here and here on the inner part of both knees. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes. A little. Here. And here too. Is… achey pain. Not bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild achey pain with palpation on the inner aspect of both knees. Now, let’s check the range of motion. Can you bend your knees up as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: I try. Is hard. Is… stuck a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A slightly limited range of motion. And now, can you try to straighten your legs out fully?
PATIENT: I can. Like this? Is… not easy. I feel a pull.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited extension as well. Now, let's move to your back. Could you lean forward and touch your toes, or go as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… my back. No, I can’t touch my toes. Is… too much. I feel it in my lower back.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s fine, don't push it. I see limited forward flexion. And now, can you try to twist to the left and then to the right, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay. Left… is okay. Right… a little tight. Feels… stuck. Like old lady back.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting limited rotation on the right side. All right, Lindra, that was helpful. It seems you have some stiffness and limited range of motion in both your knees and lower back, along with some pain. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit, if you don't mind. Do you have any other health conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm… I have high blood pressure. Doctor give me pills. I take them every day. And… I had a little problem with my heart, long time ago. But doctor say is okay now. They give me another pill for that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and a past heart issue, both managed with medication. Do you know the names of those medications, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh… names? No, I don’t remember names. I just take the little pills. One is white, and one is… blue. I take them with my breakfast. My son, he knows the names.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, we can look those up in your records. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my skin gets itchy, but that is just from the sun. I live in Honduras, you know? Is very hot there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, just some sun sensitivity. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the heart issue you mentioned?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Yes, I had my gallbladder out, long time ago. Maybe 20 years? And… when I was young, I broke my arm. But that is all. I mostly stay healthy. For an old lady.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken arm in the past. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had diabetes. And my father, he had… trouble with his legs. He couldn’t walk very well when he got old. And my sister, she had high blood pressure too. Like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, leg problems, and high blood pressure. And lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I cook for myself. I watch my stories on the TV. I go to church on Sunday. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink much. Sometimes a little wine with dinner. Mostly I just… rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, you live independently, you cook for yourself, you're social with church, and you don't smoke or drink heavily. Alright, Lindra, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, based on everything you’ve told me and the exam I performed, it seems you have some osteoarthritis in your knees and back, which is causing pain and stiffness. It’s common, especially as we age, and we can certainly manage it. We can also address your past medical history. I want to run a few blood tests to check your kidney function, your blood sugar levels, and to get a better picture of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Is… needles? I don’t like needles. But… if you say is important, okay. I trust you, Doctor. You seem nice.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lindra, I appreciate that. And yes, it does involve a small needle, but it's very quick. We'll just take a small sample of blood from your arm. My nurse, Maria, will draw the blood for you. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend some gentle exercises you can do at home to help improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. I'll also prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Exercises? I don’t know any exercises. And pain reliever… is strong? I don’t want to be sleepy.
DOCTOR: The exercises will be very gentle, Maria can show you some simple ones to start with. They're designed to help keep your joints moving and prevent them from getting stiffer. As for the pain reliever, it’s a mild one, not a strong one, and shouldn't make you sleepy. It's just to help take the edge off the pain so you can be more comfortable and do those exercises. Now, I also think it would be beneficial for you to see a physical therapist. They can create a more personalized exercise plan for you and teach you techniques to manage your pain. Would you be open to a referral to physical therapy?
PATIENT: Physical… what? Is more doctors? I already have so many pills. And now more… therapy? I don’t know. Is expensive?
DOCTOR: Physical therapy is not a doctor, it’s a specialist who helps you with movement and strength. They’ll work with you to improve your ability to do everyday tasks. As for the cost, most insurance plans cover physical therapy, and we can check your coverage to see what your out-of-pocket expenses would be. To sum up, I’m going to order the blood tests, prescribe a mild pain reliever, and get a referral for you to a physical therapist. Also, Maria will review some fall prevention tips with you, just to ensure your safety. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fall… prevention? I already fall once. In the garden. But I okay. Okay. Blood tests, pills, therapy… and no falling. Is a lot. But okay. If you think is good for me, I will try.
DOCTOR: That’s great, Lindra. It is a lot, but we’ll take it one step at a time. Maria will come in shortly to draw the blood, and she’ll give you all the instructions you need for the blood tests and the pain medication. I’ll also have the physical therapy referral sent to your insurance company. Do you have any questions for me before Maria arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You very patient with old lady.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. It's my pleasure. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Maria will be right with you shortly.
