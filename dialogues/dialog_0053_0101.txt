DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of mi head, y’know? Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, but it comes and goes, and when it does come…whew! It’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: A nuisance, yes. Well, headaches are…common. But we need to figure out what kind of nuisance we're dealing with. "A little bit now" is rather vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: You're right, you’re right. “A little bit” is…not very helpful, is it? Let me see… it started maybe… three weeks ago, I reckon? Not every day, maybe three or four times a week. And it doesn't last long, usually just a couple hours. But when it hits, it’s a sharp pain, right at the base of mi skull. Makes it hard to concentrate, especially when I’m doin’ someone’s nails. Can’t be steady with shaky hands, y’know?
DOCTOR: So, you're a…manicurist?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. Been doin’ nails for…oh, goodness, almost fifty years now! Mi wife says I should retire, but I enjoy it too much. Keeps mi mind sharp, usually. But like I said, this headache makes it difficult sometimes. Especially with the finer details. And it’s started to worry mi a little bit, to be honest. Never had headaches like this before.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… remarkable. Though, I suppose a steady hand is rather important in your line of work. Worrying is understandable. We need to rule out anything… serious, naturally. Have you noticed anything else accompanying these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No fever, no dizziness, no blurry vision. Not nauseous, thankfully. Just the pain. Sometimes, I feel a little… tired, but I’m 87, Doctor! I get tired easily these days, if I'm bein' honest. I don’t think that’s connected, though. And no numbness or weakness, nothin’ like that. Just… the headache. It doesn't seem to be worse with bright light or loud noises either.
DOCTOR: Right. So, isolated headaches…at the base of the skull…no neurological symptoms. And you’re sure they haven't gotten worse recently?
PATIENT: No, not worse, exactly. Maybe a little more frequent, but the pain itself hasn't gotten any stronger, if that makes sense? It's just…there. A nagging sort of pain, more than a crippling one. It just feels…unusual, y’know? I’m a pretty healthy man for mi age, and I don’t usually complain. Mi wife would tell you that’s a lie, but still… I usually push through things. This…this feels different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, right there! That’s a bit sore, yes. Not sharp, just…tender. And maybe…a little bit down here too. But that one's not so bad. It's mostly at the base of mi skull, on this side.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you turn your head to the left, like you're trying to look over your shoulder?
PATIENT: There we go… that's a bit stiff, Doctor. Not painful, exactly, but it doesn't move as easy as it used to. I don’t get out and about as much these days, so I suppose mi muscles are a bit tight. It’s not somethin’ I usually pay much attention to. It’s a little uncomfortable, but I can do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about this?
PATIENT: That's a little easier, yes. Not bad at all, really. Mi right side feels a bit more…loose, I suppose. Back feels alright, Doctor. A little achey, maybe, from bein’ old, but nothin’ new. Mi wife gives me these creams for it sometimes, they help a little. Mostly just need a good rub, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some tenderness at the base of the skull, slightly restricted range of motion, and some general muscle ache… it's…likely tension headaches. A common ailment, especially given your age and…occupation. But we should rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, you say? Hmm. I suppose that makes sense. I do spend a lot of time bent over, lookin’ at tiny nails. Never thought about it causin’ mi headaches, though. But you said you want to rule things out? What sort of things are we talkin’ about, Doctor? I don't want to worry mi wife unnecessarily. She gets anxious enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Well, just to be thorough, we’ll want to get a basic blood workup to rule out anything inflammatory. And…perhaps an imaging scan, just to visualize everything. An MRI would be best, but a CT scan is quicker and easier. It's standard procedure, really. We need to make sure there’s nothing else going on. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but better safe than sorry. And frankly, at your age, it's always best to be cautious. It's not to alarm your wife, it's to reassure everyone.
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? Goodness. That sounds… serious. And a CT scan too? I’ve never had either of those done before. Is it… uncomfortable? And what sort of things are we lookin’ for exactly? I understand you want to be cautious, but I really don’t want to put mi wife through worryin’ unnecessarily. She’s already been fussin’ over mi a little bit, with these headaches. Is there anything else we can try first? Perhaps some…stretches? Or a different cream? I really don’t like the sound of these scans, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, with all due respect, stretches and creams are unlikely to rule out a potential underlying issue. While I appreciate your desire to avoid scans, they’re necessary to ensure a proper diagnosis. The scans themselves are relatively painless. The MRI involves lying still in a large machine, and the CT scan is a quick X-ray. It's not ideal, but it's far better to know what we’re dealing with. We're looking for anything unusual – tumors, aneurysms, structural abnormalities… But again, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. It’s simply a precaution. It's about responsible care, sir. Not just treating symptoms, but understanding their cause.
PATIENT: Tumors… aneurysms… Oh dear. You said it’s unlikely, but…those are frightening words, Doctor. I understand what you’re sayin’ about responsible care, but I’m 87 years old! I’ve had a good life. Is it really necessary to put mi wife through all this worry, and myself through these…procedures, for somethin’ that’s probably just tension? Perhaps we could just monitor it for a while? See if the pain gets worse? I really don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your concerns, truly. But as a physician, I have a duty to investigate any potential cause for your headaches. “Just monitoring” isn’t responsible care. If it is something serious, delaying diagnosis could have…consequences. And frankly, I need to be able to document a thorough workup. We’ll proceed with the blood work and the CT scan. It's a standard protocol, and I assure you, we'll minimize any unnecessary stress. We can schedule the scan for next week, and I’ll personally explain the results to you and your wife. We’ll start with the bloodwork today. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: …I suppose so. If you think it’s really necessary. But please, Doctor, be gentle with mi wife. She gets very upset. And explain everything to me in plain English, alright? No fancy medical words. Just… tell me what’s goin’ on, in a way I can understand. And if it is somethin’ serious… well, I trust you’ll do what’s best. Let’s just get it over with, then. Bloodwork today, you say? Alright. Let's get started. .
