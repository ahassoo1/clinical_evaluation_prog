DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Pfennig, you say? Hmm. Well, the company… they send me. Said I need to come get checked. Nothing wrong with me, you understand. I still work every day. Strong as an ox, I am. But they worry too much these days. Old man's work, mining. They want to be sure, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that they’re being proactive about your health, even if you’re feeling well. It’s common for employers to require check-ups, especially with physically demanding work like mining. So, even though you feel strong as an ox, let's just go through a general assessment to make sure everything is running smoothly. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about what kind of work you do in the mine?
PATIENT: Work? I operate the machines. Big ones. Load the rocks, move them around. Been doing it... oh, a long time. Since before you were born, I reckon. Underground mostly. Dusty. Loud. It’s a man’s job, not for the faint of heart. What do you need to know exactly? Just tell me. Don't need to beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: No bush-beating here, sir. I appreciate you being so direct. Working underground with heavy machinery, especially with dust and noise… that gives me a good starting point. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing recently?
PATIENT: Breathing? What kind of changes? I breathe. Everyone breathes. Always have. It’s… normal. Maybe a little harder when I climb the stairs at home, but I'm an old man, aren’t I? Not a young spring chicken anymore. You think the dust is getting to me? Don't waste your time with that. I’ve been breathing that dust for sixty years! It hasn’t killed me yet.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point out that you’ve been exposed to dust for a long time. It is remarkable that it hasn’t caused issues yet. But long-term exposure can sometimes lead to changes that develop slowly. When you say “a little harder” climbing the stairs, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… like a weight. Not pain, exactly. Just… more effort. Like my lungs are full of cotton. Not always, mind you. Just when I push myself. My wife used to say I never knew my own strength. Maybe I'm losing it. But I still manage, see? Still get the job done. Don't need you worrying about an old man’s stairs. What else you want to know?
DOCTOR: That description – “lungs full of cotton” – is helpful, thank you. And it’s good to know it happens with exertion. It sounds like you're aware of a change in your breathing capacity, which is good self-awareness. Let's broaden things a bit. Besides the breathing, have you noticed any coughs, wheezing, or chest tightness?
PATIENT: Coughs? Everyone coughs. Especially in the winter. Dust gets in your throat, you know? And the cold air. Wheezing… no. Never wheezed. Chest tightness… sometimes. After a long day, maybe. Like a muscle ache. I’m a big man, I carry a lot. You think that has something to do with it? Honestly, I think you doctors just like to ask a lot of questions. Not much wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It’s true, I do ask a lot of questions. It helps me get a complete picture. You're right, muscle aches from physical labor are common. But chest tightness, even if it feels like a muscle ache, can sometimes indicate other things. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me once, years ago, it was a little high. Gave me a pill. I took it for a while. Then I forgot. Still felt fine. Didn't bother me none. Diabetes? No. Never had that. Heart problems… my father had a weak heart, but I feel strong. Always have. I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time, if you ask me. They just want your money. What about you? Are you a good doctor?
DOCTOR: That's fair to say. It's good to know about the past high blood pressure, even if it was a long time ago. And it’s useful to know your father had heart problems – family history is important. As for whether I'm a good doctor... I try my best. I focus on listening to my patients and doing what's best for their individual needs. And I definitely believe in preventative care. Which is why your company sent you in for this check-up. To continue getting a good picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. They fixed it. That’s it. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Not a sickly man, never have been. A few scrapes and bruises, a twisted ankle here and there, but nothing to keep me down for long. You’re asking a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago. Does any of this even matter? I'm still working, aren't I? Still strong. That should be enough.
DOCTOR: You’re right, the broken arm was a long time ago. But it’s good to have the full picture. And yes, the fact that you’re still working and feel strong is important. It tells me a lot. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re agreeable. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Medications? Just that pill for the blood pressure, years ago. Stopped taking it, like I said. Don't take nothing now. Maybe a pain reliever if my back aches, but not often. Just rub some ointment on it. My wife used to make a good ointment. But she’s gone now… Been a while. You asking about pills again? Honestly, doctor, you’re making me feel old. I'm still a working man. Healthy as an ox, mostly. Can we just get this over with? Physical exam, you say? Fine. Get it done.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are making you feel uncomfortable. I understand. You're right to remind me that you’re a working man and feel healthy. My intention is just to ensure you stay that way. I’ll keep the exam brief. Before we proceed, can you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Eat everything. Dust, dirt, anything. Strong stomach. My wife always said I could eat a whole goat by myself. No problems. You sure you need to ask all these questions? Seems like a waste of time, if you ask me. Just check me over, see I’m alright, and let me go back to work. I got things to do, you know. No time for doctors and questions. I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. No allergies, that's good to know. And I understand you're a busy man. I’ll be quick. Let's start with your height and weight. Then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Height and weight… go ahead. Just don’t make me stand here all day. I’m a working man, remember? Got things to do. And don’t tell me I'm getting old. I’m still strong. Get on with it. Just be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please step onto the scale for me, sir. Okay, 169 centimeters and 129 pounds. Thank you. Your blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds… a little muffled, but no murmurs. Lungs sound slightly diminished bilaterally, with some mild wheezing on exhale. I'm noting some mild diminished lung sounds and slight wheezing, along with a slightly elevated blood pressure. It’s not alarming, but it warrants further investigation. Did you experience anything while I was listening to your lungs?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Diminished sounds? What are you talking about? I didn’t feel nothing. I just stood there. You poked and prodded. That’s all. My chest feels alright. Maybe a little tired, after all this standing around. And that blood pressure… what’s so bad about that? My father had high blood pressure, remember? It runs in the family. You’re making me nervous, doctor. I didn’t feel nothing wrong before I came here. Now I’m starting to feel something. Waste of time, this whole thing. A waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bigger. It's not uncommon to feel anxious during a medical exam, and I apologize if I've made you feel uneasy. I wasn’t trying to alarm you. The diminished lung sounds and slight wheezing suggest some narrowing in your airways. It’s possible it’s related to your long-term exposure to dust, or simply age-related changes. The elevated blood pressure, especially given your family history, is something we should monitor. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us see your lungs in more detail, and the blood work will check your overall health and kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Now you want to take things out of me? I didn't come here for that! I told you, I'm fine. Still working. Still strong. This is getting ridiculous. I don’t need any X-rays or blood work. I just want to go home. And I want you to tell me I'm alright. That's all I want. My company just wants to be sure I can still do my job. Tell them that. Tell them I'm still strong. Don’t waste my time with needles and machines. It's a waste of time. A complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your reluctance. I truly do. And I respect your feelings. However, as a physician, my responsibility is to ensure your health and well-being. While you feel strong, these preliminary findings suggest we need to investigate further to rule out any potential problems. I’m not trying to scare you. The X-ray and blood work are relatively simple tests that can provide valuable information. They won’t take long, and they can give us peace of mind. However, if you absolutely refuse, I will respect your decision. But I must strongly advise against it. If you decline the tests, I will document your refusal in your chart and inform your company that you declined further investigation. But I cannot in good conscience tell them you are “alright” without having a better understanding of your condition. What would you like to do?
PATIENT: … Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick. And don’t tell me I got anything wrong. I don't want to hear it. Just tell my company I’m still fit for work. That's all I want. Still working. Still strong. And make it quick. I got things to do. A man’s work. Don’t keep me here all day. Do the tests and let me go. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I will order the X-ray and blood work right away. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood, and I’ll send you over to radiology for the X-ray after that. I understand you don’t want to hear anything alarming. I will review the results carefully and discuss them with you in a straightforward manner, focusing on what we can do to maintain your health and ability to work. Is there anyone you'd like me to contact with the results?
PATIENT: No. Nobody. Don’t contact nobody. I take care of myself. Always have. Just give me the results. And let me go home. That’s all I want. This is getting me tired. Too much talk. Too much poking. Just let me go home. My wife… she'd always tell me to stop worrying so much. But she's gone now. Just… let me go home. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I understand. I won’t contact anyone without your permission. The lab technician will be in shortly. I will let you know as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please try to relax. And please, don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you feel unwell. I'll step out now to let the technician in. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Bigger. And please remember, taking care of your health isn’t a sign of weakness, but of strength. It allows you to continue doing the work you enjoy.
PATIENT: .
