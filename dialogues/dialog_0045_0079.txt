DOCTOR: Alright, Courtnye. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Billman. It’s…well, I’ve been bruising really easily lately. It’s kinda scary, ‘cause I’m already on a blood thinner, you know? It just seems like everything leaves a mark now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bruising easily, and you're already on a blood thinner… right. And how long has this been going on, this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…probably about three weeks ago? Maybe a little longer. It was just a tiny one at first, bumped my arm on the doorframe. But then another one, and another…now it feels like I get one just from looking at something wrong. It's definitely worse than before, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, progressively getting worse. Okay. And what blood thinner are you currently taking, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: It’s…Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. My regular doctor prescribed it after I had that blood clot in my leg last year. I try to keep up with the dose, but sometimes…life happens, you know? I might miss a pill now and then. It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: “Life happens,” right. Well, missing doses of Warfarin can certainly cause…problems. We'll need to get that sorted out. Do you regularly have your INR checked to make sure the Warfarin is at the correct level?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I do. I go to the lab every month. They stick me with a needle and everything. My regular doctor gets the results, and she tells me if I need to adjust the dose. I always follow her instructions. Seriously. It’s just…sometimes I forget which day to go. But I eventually get there. It’s been…a little stressful keeping track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Monthly INR checks...good. Although, if you're consistently forgetting which day to go, that could be affecting things. Look, Warfarin is a tricky medication. It’s not something you just…wing. Now, aside from the bruising, are you noticing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt weak or anything. No bleeding gums when I brush my teeth. No nosebleeds. No blood in my…you know. Just the bruising. It’s mostly on my arms and legs, like little purple and blue flowers blooming everywhere. It doesn’t hurt exactly, just…looks bad. It’s kinda worrying me, to be honest. I don’t want to end up in the hospital again.
DOCTOR: No other bleeding symptoms, just the bruising on arms and legs. Alright. And have you had any injuries lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, normal bumps and scrapes, you know? Like I said, I bumped my arm on the doorframe a few weeks ago, that was probably the first bruise. But everything else just…appeared. Like I haven’t even touched myself and there’s a bruise there the next day. It's weird. I haven't fallen or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Appeared,” you say. Alright. Well, let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds good. Here, you can see some of them here. And there’s more on my legs, but I didn't want to take off my pants in front of everyone. They're mostly different sizes and colors, some are old, some are new. It's a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hmmm. These do look…extensive. And the varying colors suggest they are at different stages of healing, which is consistent with your report. It’s good you are keeping track of the timing. Let's check your legs. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to move or anything. I’m a little self-conscious, but…I guess you’ve seen it all before, right? I just hope it’s nothing serious. This is kinda freaking me out.
DOCTOR: Alright. There’s quite a bit here as well, consistent with your arms. No obvious swelling or warmth, which is good. And you don’t report any pain with this, correct?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just…bruises. Lots of them. They don't hurt unless I bump into something on them, then it's just a normal bump kinda pain. It’s more the sight of them that's bothering me, you know? And worrying about why it’s happening. I’ve never had bruising like this before. It's kinda scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye. Well, based on what you've told me, and what I've seen here, it is concerning. We need to rule out some things. The fact that you’re already on Warfarin complicates this, because it’s a known cause of bruising. But, significant unexplained bruising can also be a sign of other issues. We need to check a complete blood count – CBC – to see if your platelets are normal. That’s a basic blood test. And, while I suspect it’s related to your medication, we should also rule out any other underlying causes.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…responsible. A blood test. Is that going to be expensive? I don't exactly have a lot of money right now. And what does "platelets" mean? I always forget all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that help it clot. Basically, they're responsible for stopping bleeding. If your platelet count is low, you bruise and bleed more easily. As for the cost… well, you said you are uninsured, right?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. No insurance at all. I really should get some, I know, but…it's just expensive. So, how much is this test going to be? Is there any way to get it cheaper? I don’t want to get a huge bill I can’t pay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me check with the lab. The cost will vary, but it’s probably going to be somewhere in the range of $150 to $200, maybe less. We do have a financial assistance program here at the clinic, but eligibility requirements apply. I can have someone from the billing department contact you after this appointment to discuss your options. We can also see if there are any charitable programs in the area that might help. But, honestly, Courtnye, we need to rule out something serious here. Waiting and hoping isn’t going to help.
PATIENT: Okay, $150 to $200...I think I can swing that, if I cut back on some things. And yes, please, have the billing department talk to me about the assistance program. That would be great. I really appreciate it. So, we do the blood test, and then what? Do I have to stop taking my Warfarin? I don’t want to mess with that without talking to my regular doctor first.
DOCTOR: No, do not stop your Warfarin. Absolutely not. We need to know what’s happening with you on your current medication. The blood test will give us some clues. Depending on the results, we may need to refer you to a hematologist—a blood specialist—for further evaluation. They can determine if it's a Warfarin-related issue, or something else entirely. We'll start with the basics, though. I'm going to order the CBC now, and the lab technician will come in and draw some blood. It will only take a few minutes. Here’s the order. The technician should be in shortly. In the meantime, I want you to be very careful—avoid any activities that could cause injury. And if you notice any new bleeding—nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, careful, no injuries, and emergency room if there's new bleeding. Got it. A hematologist…that sounds serious. I really hope it’s just something minor. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully, this blood test will give us some answers. I think that’s all I need for now. .
