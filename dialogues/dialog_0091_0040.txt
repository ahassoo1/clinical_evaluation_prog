DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Comes and goes, but it’s been happening quite a bit lately. And with it, I keep getting these… water infections, the doctor calls them. They're not pleasant at all. It’s been going on for a while now, and my regular doctor suggested I come see a specialist.
DOCTOR: I see. Pain in your side and recurrent urinary tract infections. Thank you for clarifying. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s mostly on my right side, kind of low down, in my back. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, you know? And it can come on suddenly, or just build up slowly over a day or two. It doesn't always radiate, but sometimes it goes a bit around to my tummy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Espinueva. A dull ache, primarily on the right side, low in your back, occasionally radiating to your abdomen. And you mentioned it can come on suddenly or gradually. Approximately how long has this pain been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. It's been… years, really. But the last few months, it’s definitely gotten worse. I suppose the infections have been happening on and off for about a year, maybe a bit longer. It’s hard to say exactly, Doctor. I don’t keep a strict record, you see. I just try to manage it as best I can.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to recall precise timelines. So, years of intermittent side pain, worsening over the last few months, and recurrent urinary tract infections for about a year. Could you describe the urinary tract infections themselves?
PATIENT: Well, the usual things, Doctor. A burning sensation when I… go to the toilet. And a constant need to go, even when there's not much there. Sometimes a bit of discomfort, lower down. Nothing too severe, usually, but enough to be very bothersome. I’ve been getting antibiotics from my doctor, and they usually clear it up, but it keeps coming back. That’s what worried me, you see. It feels like a cycle.
DOCTOR: Alright, so burning with urination, frequency, and some lower abdominal discomfort associated with the infections, which respond to antibiotics but recur. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting accompanying either the pain or the infections?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. And thankfully, no vomiting. There’s been a little bit of blood in my urine a couple of times, just a tinge, really. Not a lot. It worried me then, of course, but it didn't last long. Just once or twice in the past year, I'd say. It was enough to make me call the doctor, but it cleared up with the antibiotics too. It's hard to remember the exact details, you see. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. A tinge of blood in the urine a couple of times in the past year, resolving with antibiotics. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… No diabetes, no. My blood pressure is usually a bit high, the doctor says, but I take a tablet for it. Nothing too serious. And my heart… well, I get a little breathless sometimes, but the doctor says that’s just my age, mostly. I had a bit of trouble with my kidneys a while back, years ago now. They told me I had… polycystic kidney disease, I think it was called. Is that right, Doctor? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Espinueva, polycystic kidney disease is significant information. Thank you for mentioning that. And you take medication for high blood pressure. Could you tell me what medication you are currently taking for your blood pressure, and the dosage if you know it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see if I can remember… It's a little white tablet. I think it's… Amlodipine? Yes, that sounds right. Five milligrams, I believe. I take one every morning. My wife usually helps me with the pills, to be honest. I'm not always the best at remembering these things. But yes, five milligrams of Amlodipine, every morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, 5 milligrams of Amlodipine daily. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medication. I’ve had a few antibiotics over the years, of course, but never any trouble. My wife always asks when they prescribe something new, but I've never had to worry about an allergy. I’m quite lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your past surgical history, if any?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. That was the only surgery I’ve ever had, as far as I can remember. Nothing else. I’ve been quite fortunate, really. I’ve managed to avoid most serious illnesses, thankfully. Just this kidney business and the side pain lately. And the water infections, of course. But nothing major, nothing like a big operation.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in your youth. And finally, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, like me. And I think my brother had some trouble with his kidneys too, a long time ago. Not the same as me, I don't think, but something with them, anyway. My father was healthy as a horse, as they say. Never a day’s illness in his life. But my mother and brother, they had some health issues, yes. It’s hard to remember all the details, Doctor. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things as much back then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or masses. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. This is not necessarily concerning, given your age, but we'll keep it in mind. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Does this cause any pain here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… that's a bit tender. Right there, on my right side. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache, like I usually get. It’s not too bad, but I can definitely feel it when you press. And… yes, a little bit lower down too, towards my flank. That’s where the pain usually starts. It’s not awful, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness in the right flank and upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam. This is just to rule out any nerve involvement. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Reflexes and nerves… sounds fine to me. I trust you know what you're doing. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and sensation is intact bilaterally. Based on the physical exam and your history, Mr. Espinueva, the recurrent urinary tract infections coupled with the right flank pain suggest a possible kidney issue. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease, it’s important to investigate this further. I'd like to order a urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a kidney function panel. We should also get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to visualize your kidneys and rule out any obstruction or other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's best, then I agree. Urinalysis, blood tests, and a scan… yes, let's do it. I want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It’s been bothering me for too long. So yes, please, let’s do all the tests. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for the CBC and kidney function panel right away. She’ll also provide you with a sterile container for the urinalysis sample. Please collect a mid-stream urine sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream – and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. We’ll schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. The radiology department will call you with the details. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe flank pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Blood tests now, urine sample to the lab, and a scan tomorrow. And emergency room if I get a fever or bad pain. I think I’ve got it. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. When should I expect a call about the scan tomorrow?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could clarify. The radiology department will typically call within 24 to 48 hours with the results of the CT scan. However, it's best to allow a full 48 hours just to be safe. My office will also follow up with you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan once we have them. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything so well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this properly. I’ll get the tests done as you instructed. Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I am happy to help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
