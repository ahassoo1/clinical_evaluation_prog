DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, honestly… it’s my memory. It's been getting worse, and it’s starting to worry me a little. I just… forget things. Little things, mostly, but now it feels like bigger things too.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly wise to address concerns about memory changes. It’s good you’re being proactive. “Little things” and “bigger things” can mean a lot of different things to different people. Could you give me some examples of what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Okay, like, yesterday I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for! I just stood there, staring at the produce section. And… last week, I had a dentist appointment – my dentist appointment – and I missed it! I didn’t even realize until I got a call. It’s… embarrassing, really. And sometimes I have trouble remembering people’s names, even people I’ve known for a while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. Those are all concerning examples. Forgetting things, especially appointments or what you were intending to do, and difficulty with names… those warrant further investigation. To get a better understanding, let's talk a little more about this. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I think it’s been gradual, honestly. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I’d say over the last six months or so it’s definitely gotten worse. It used to be just occasionally misplacing my keys, but now… well, now it's like I'm constantly second-guessing myself. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. A gradual onset is important information. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. I sleep okay, I guess. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I work long hours. And I haven’t noticed any… well, any changes in my vision or anything like that. I haven’t fallen or anything. Just… the memory stuff. Is there anything else I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Fatigue can sometimes be a factor, as can stress, but it's good you haven't experienced other neurological symptoms. Let’s move on to some other areas. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, but that’s about it. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I get regular check-ups with my family doctor, but he’s never mentioned anything concerning. I don’t take any regular medication either, just the occasional pain reliever if I get a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a little tricky. My mother, she had some… problems later in life. She got very confused sometimes. My aunt said it was just old age, but she did need a lot of care towards the end. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never a sick day in his life. I don't really know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren't very close.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history can be difficult to piece together. The information about your mother is relevant, though. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never been much of a drinker. I don't smoke, and definitely no drugs. I try to eat healthy, although it's hard with my work schedule. I do drink a lot of coffee, though! Probably too much, actually. And I try to exercise when I can, but it's not a regular thing. I walk a lot at work, being a dentist and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to confirm, no allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I guess. Is that everything? I’m starting to feel a little silly talking about all this, but I want to be sure I’m telling you everything you need to know.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Heidenthal. It's important to be thorough, and you're doing a good job. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. This will involve some simple tests of your memory, balance, reflexes, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could please have a seat here, that would be great. We’ll start with a few basic questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh… um… today is… August… the 2nd? Yes, August 2nd. 2025. I think. Is that right? I always mess up the years.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common to stumble on the date sometimes. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy! We’re in… well, I work downtown… so… is it… Chicago? Yes, Chicago. I think it’s Chicago. I haven’t been anywhere else recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Try to remember them, as I will ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay, I think I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. It’s just… a little hard to focus sometimes. I have so much on my mind.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Now, let's move on to some basic orientation questions. Do you know what year it currently is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… is it… 2025? I think it’s 2025… but I’m really not sure. I'm getting so confused. I really thought I knew that. It feels like everything is slipping away.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. We'll figure this out. Now, let’s test your short-term memory. I'm going to name three objects, then ask you to recall them after a short delay. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Please go ahead. I’ll try my best. This is a little stressful, though, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's understandable to feel stressed. Alright. The three objects are: a pen, a key, and a clock. Please try to remember those. Now, can you tell me the three objects I just named?
PATIENT: Oh… um… a pen… and… oh dear. I’m blanking. A pen… and… I can't remember the other two. I’m so embarrassed. I should remember this! It feels like they were just said, but… they’re gone. A pen… that’s all I’ve got. I’m really struggling. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, it’s alright. There’s no need to be embarrassed. These are just preliminary tests, and they help me understand what’s going on. Now, let's move on to a quick assessment of your reflexes and coordination. Could you please extend your arms in front of you with your palms facing up?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I’m a little worried now. Are you finding something bad? I feel like I'm failing a test.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that we're just gathering information at this point. Your reflexes seem normal, and your coordination is adequate, although slightly diminished. Now, I want to be thorough. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. Also, I’d recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening and what we can do about it. An MRI… that sounds a little scary, but… if it will help, then yes. Please, do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will write the orders for the blood work and MRI right away. The MRI will require a referral, which I'll also take care of. They will contact you directly to schedule the appointment. In the meantime, I want to assure you that these tests are just to rule out other possible causes of your memory difficulties. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or a thyroid problem. I'd also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in approximately two weeks, once we have the results of the tests. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure this out. It’s just… it’s unsettling not knowing. I feel like I’m losing myself. I’m a dentist! I need to remember things!
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Heidenthal. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. And it's even more concerning when it affects your profession. We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I will also provide you with a list of resources about memory loss and support groups, in case you'd like to explore those options. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll have a better understanding once we have the results of the tests. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing that we’re doing something about it. I’ll wait for the call to schedule the tests. Is there anything I should do or avoid before the MRI?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Regarding the MRI, please let the scheduling facility know if you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker or any surgical hardware. Also, avoid wearing any jewelry or clothing with metal fasteners. Other than that, you can continue with your normal routine. Here are those resources I mentioned. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks. If you experience any sudden changes or worsening of your symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Heidenthal. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: .
