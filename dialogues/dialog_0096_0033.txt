DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Julie, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My… assistant, I suppose you’d call her, insisted. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s all rather inconvenient, if you must know. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Right. An assistant scheduled the appointment… and you’re experiencing some difficulty with your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That’s what she said. It came on… suddenly, I think. Though to be perfectly frank, I don’t pay much attention to such things. It’s just… everything seems a bit muffled and blurry. Not that it matters much, really. I have people for these sorts of things. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Well, “not much” is relative, Mrs. Julie. We need to figure out what is causing these changes, even if you have help at home. “Suddenly” is also important. Can you tell me when you first noticed the muffling and blurring?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t a clue. Perhaps a week ago? Maybe two? It’s difficult to say. I was preoccupied with… more important matters. A charity gala, you understand. One simply doesn’t notice these things when one is organizing such events. Is there not a quicker way to determine what’s wrong? I have a luncheon scheduled for one o'clock.
DOCTOR: Right. A charity gala. Well, Mrs. Julie, even important events don't excuse us from paying attention to our health. To help me narrow things down, let’s start with your hearing. Is the muffling in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, really, Doctor. Must we delve into such unpleasant specifics? It’s… both, I believe. Or perhaps it’s just everything sounding… distant. As if I’m underwater. Honestly, it's quite irritating. Are you sure you can't simply prescribe something? A pill, perhaps? I haven't the patience for a lengthy examination.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Julie, I understand you’re busy, but prescribing medication without knowing the cause of your symptoms would be irresponsible, and potentially dangerous. “Distant” and “irritating” are not diagnoses. Now, let’s move on to your vision. Is the blurring constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill, Doctor. Fine. It comes and goes. Sometimes everything is quite clear, and then… it’s as if someone smeared Vaseline on my glasses. Though I assure you, my glasses are perfectly clean. Is that satisfactory? Can we please move this along? I have a reputation to uphold, you know. This is quite… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might be related?
PATIENT: Changed? What on earth do you mean, “changed”? I live a perfectly normal life, Doctor. I attend galas, I oversee charitable donations, I… well, I manage things. Nothing particularly new has occurred. Although… there was that dreadful incident with the caterer last month. But I highly doubt that has anything to do with my… vague hearing and vision issues. Really, Doctor, are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Julie, I am listening. But we need to rule things out. Sometimes seemingly unrelated events can provide clues. Let's try this. Any new medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I have a perfectly good physician who handles all of that. He’s a very… discerning doctor. I wouldn’t dream of self-medicating. Although… now that you mention it, I did try one of those herbal teas my housekeeper insisted on. Something about… blueberries and chamomile. But it tasted dreadful, and I only had one cup. It certainly wasn’t that. Honestly, this is becoming quite tedious. Is there truly nothing you can do without subjecting me to a battery of tests? .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Julie, with all due respect, I need more information to determine the cause of your symptoms. A "battery of tests" as you call them, may be necessary. But before we get to that, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
