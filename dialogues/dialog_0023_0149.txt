DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it's…well, it's mostly my daughter, bless her heart, fussing. She says I need to be "checked out." I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. Don't see what all the worry is about. I’ve been a podiatrist for…oh, a long time. Longer than you’ve been alive, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate your…vigorous health, Ms. Gunasekara, it's often helpful to have a professional opinion, even when one feels well. Sometimes things can develop subtly. Your daughter sounds concerned. Just to be thorough, could you tell me anything at all that's been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Oh, she always worries. Thinks I can't look after myself anymore. Honestly, the only thing is…my feet, maybe? They've been a little…sensitive. But that's nothing a good soak and some lotion can't fix. Been doing that for years. It’s the price you pay for standing all day, you know? Like I said, I’m a podiatrist! I know feet. Don't need a doctor telling me about feet.
DOCTOR: Of course. Still, even those who specialize in a field benefit from an outside perspective. “Sensitive” – can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, Doctor, it’s just…aching. Especially at the end of the day. And sometimes they feel a little…tight. Like my shoes are too small, even when they aren't. It’s probably just old age creeping up, you know? Things wear out. It’s the natural order of things. Honestly, I don't see what the fuss is about. It's not like I can't walk. I still get around perfectly well.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this aching and tightness new, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's…a good question. I suppose it’s been gradual. I don’t really keep track of things like that. It's not like it came on suddenly one day. It’s just…slowly getting a bit more bothersome, maybe? A long time ago, I could stand all day with no problem at all. Now…well, I take more breaks, that's all. And I have a very comfortable pair of shoes. That's the important thing.
DOCTOR: Very sensible. And just to get a complete picture, are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your feet, or any changes in their color or temperature?
PATIENT: Numbness? Oh, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything feels fine. Temperature…well, sometimes my feet get a little cold, but that's just because I'm old. Old people are always cold, aren’t they? Color… I haven't looked at them that closely, Doctor. I treat feet all day, I don't need to stare at my own! Honestly, you're asking me to do a self-exam. I'm a doctor, not a patient!
DOCTOR: I understand your…frustration, Ms. Gunasekara. It's simply my due diligence to ask these questions. Now, outside of your feet, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… well, I get tired easier, I suppose. But that’s to be expected, isn't it? I’m eighty-three years old! Things slow down. My daughter keeps telling me I need to “take it easy” but I don’t like taking it easy. It's boring. Besides, I've always been a busy person. I used to volunteer at the church every week, but… I haven't been lately. Maybe that’s a change. It’s just… hard to get motivated sometimes.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any pain anywhere else in your body besides your feet?
PATIENT: Pain… well, my knees ache a bit sometimes. But that's old age again, Doctor! Everyone gets achy knees. I used to play tennis, you know. A lot of tennis. Probably wore them out. It's not constant, thankfully. Just when the weather's bad, or if I've been on my feet too long. Honestly, I've just been trying to ignore it. What good does complaining do? It won't make it go away.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, just to complete the history, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. My daughter handles all that, you see. She fills the little pill organizer every week. I don’t really pay attention to names. Something for my cholesterol, too, probably. And… Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor told me I was low on it. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I just take what she tells me to take, you see? I don’t like to fuss with things. It's all handled.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Always have. My mother used to say I had an iron stomach. Maybe I had a little trouble with penicillin when I was a child, but that was a long, long time ago. I haven’t taken penicillin in decades. Honestly, I don’t remember it being that bad. Just a little rash, I think. Nothing to worry about. I don’t have any problems with anything these days. Except for dust, maybe? I sneeze a bit when I’m cleaning. But that’s not an allergy, is it? It’s just… dust!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve checking your feet, your reflexes, and listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? After all this questioning! Honestly, Doctor, I told you, I’m a podiatrist. You can look at my feet all you want, you won’t find anything wrong. I practically know my own feet inside and out. But, alright. Go ahead. Get it over with. Just…be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'm simply completing a routine assessment, Ms. Gunasekara. Pulse is present, but diminished. Some mild erythema present on the plantar aspect of both feet, and significant callusing. There's some onychomycosis present. Sensation is intact, but slightly reduced. Ankle reflexes are present, but sluggish. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. "Diminished DP pulses bilaterally, mild erythema and significant calluses on plantar aspect, onychomycosis present, sensation slightly reduced, sluggish ankle reflexes, slightly distant heart sounds." Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and to rule out any underlying causes for these symptoms. I also recommend a podiatric consultation for professional callus removal and treatment of the onychomycosis.
PATIENT: Oh, so you did find something wrong! I knew it. Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, I just told you I'm fine! And a podiatric consultation? You mean another doctor looking at my feet? That's ridiculous. I am a podiatrist, remember? I think you're just trying to drum up business. Honestly, I’m not sure I want to bother with all this. It sounds… unnecessary. And expensive, I’m sure. I think I'll just go home and soak my feet. That always works.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, while you are a podiatrist, this assessment is from the perspective of a primary care physician evaluating your overall health. The blood work will help us identify potential underlying conditions like diabetes or peripheral artery disease which could be contributing to these findings. A podiatric consultation isn’t about questioning your expertise, but providing specialized care for these specific foot issues. I understand your reluctance, but I strongly recommend these tests to ensure you are receiving the best possible care. The risks of not addressing these issues outweigh the inconvenience of a simple blood draw and a consultation. We’re not trying to drum up business, Ms. Gunasekara, we’re trying to keep you healthy.
PATIENT: Oh, all right, all right. Diabetes? Peripheral artery disease? Honestly, you’re scaring me now. But if you insist… Fine. Blood work. And…a consultation. But I expect you to tell me exactly what they’re going to do, and I expect it to be quick. I don’t have all day, you know. And I want everything explained to me in plain English. No medical jargon. Can you promise me that? And I want my daughter to be there when you explain the results. She’s much better at understanding these things than I am. And no unnecessary tests. I don’t want to be poked and prodded anymore than I have to be.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I can assure you that all tests will be explained in plain English, and your daughter is welcome to attend the results discussion. We’ll only order what’s absolutely necessary to obtain a clear understanding of your condition. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. I'll also write a referral for a podiatric consultation with Dr. Ramirez. He’s highly regarded in the area. Here are the lab orders and the referral. The lab is just down the hall. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. And thank you for finally agreeing to these tests. It’s for your own well-being. I will schedule a follow up appointment for two weeks to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. That should give them enough time. Yes, that works. Honestly, all this fuss. But… thank you, Doctor. And… I suppose I appreciate you explaining things so patiently. Dr. Ramirez, you said? I’ll see what he has to say. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go get this blood work done. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Gunasekara. .
