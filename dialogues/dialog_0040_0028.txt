DOCTOR: Right, Nadene Sadhu. 89 years old… Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away. It's been…oh, goodness, at least a month now, maybe longer. And it feels…worse when I lie down, you know? Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a month, at least. Possibly a bit more, but the days all seem to run together now, don't they? It's a wet cough, mostly. I have to spit up something every morning, and sometimes during the day too. Not a lot, but enough to be bothersome. And it makes me feel…tired, just worn out.
DOCTOR: Right, a wet cough… and fatigue. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm… not that I've noticed. I haven’t been taking my temperature, dear. I just feel… warm sometimes, but I always figure that’s just from moving around the kitchen. I do a little cooking, you know, for my grandkids when they visit. It's not a high fever feeling, if that makes sense. Just…warm.
DOCTOR: "Warm." Well, that’s… helpful. Any shortness of breath with this cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…yes, actually. It’s not always there, but when I walk even a little bit, up the stairs to my apartment, or even just across the room sometimes, I get winded. And that cough… it makes it worse, of course. It feels like I can’t get enough air. It's not terrible, but it's definitely there. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it, my feet do feel a little puffy at the end of the day. Not terrible, but I have to take my shoes off as soon as I get home. My daughter keeps telling me to put my feet up, but… well, there’s always something to do, isn't there? Is that bad? Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: It could be related. Have you had any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: Chest pain… hmm. Not really pain, exactly. More of a…tightness, sometimes. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It happens mostly when I'm coughing really hard, or when I'm trying to catch my breath. It doesn't last long, just a few seconds, but it's… uncomfortable. I always thought it was just from the coughing, you know? Is that not what it is?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you been around anyone who's been sick recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a hard one. My grandkids visit, and they're always bringing something home from school, aren’t they? A sniffle here, a little cold there… I try to stay away when they’re sick, but you know how it is. Hard to say if it came from them, though. It just sort of…started. I haven't been anywhere else, really. Just home and the occasional visit to the store.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a listen to your lungs. And I’m going to check your ankles. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Okay, dear. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it's going to be cold. My skin is thin, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your lungs sound… congested. There's some wheezing, and crackles in both bases. Your ankles do have some pitting edema – that’s the swelling. I’m going to need to get a chest X-ray, and I want to check your oxygen saturation. And frankly, given your age and these symptoms, I think a blood test to rule out infection and check your heart function is a good idea. It could be pneumonia, or something related to your heart. It's hard to say for sure without further testing.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…serious. My heart? I haven’t been feeling quite right for a while now, come to think of it. Just tired, mostly. And a little weak. Is it bad? Is it something I did? I just want to be able to keep cooking for my grandkids, you know?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. It could be a number of things. The tests will give us a clearer picture. We'll get the X-ray done right away, and I’ll order the blood work. A nurse will be in shortly to draw blood, and then we'll send you over to radiology. It’s standard procedure. We need to rule things out, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Standard procedure. That makes me feel a little better. I just... I don't like being poked and prodded, you know? But if it's for the grandkids, I'll do it. Could you tell me… what are we looking for, exactly? Not to worry, just… to understand.
DOCTOR: We're checking for fluid in your lungs, signs of infection, and assessing your heart function. It's a fairly straightforward process. Frankly, at your age, these symptoms warrant a thorough investigation. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of it. The nurse will explain everything in more detail. I need to see another patient now, but I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Relax. I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it's nothing too serious. I really do.
