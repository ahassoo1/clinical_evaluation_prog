DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Genard. Welcome. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just... something's leaking. Down there. It's... not good. I don’t know what it is, but it’s been happenin’ a little while now. It’s kinda embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It is often unsettling when something unexpected happens. And you're right to get it checked out. “Down there” – can you tell me a little more about the leaking?
PATIENT: Well... it's not like a flood, thank goodness. More like... drips. And sometimes it smells... funny. Not a good funny. I tried to clean it up, but it just keeps comin' back. It's mostly when I... well, when I rest. Does that make sense? I don’t know why it's happenin'. Old age, I guess. Everything falls apart eventually.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Genard. And it's good you’re getting it checked out rather than assuming it's just age. It's important to rule things out. So, it happens mostly when you’re resting, and you’ve noticed an odor. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it relatively new?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time... maybe a couple months? Hard to say, really. Things kinda blend together when you get to be my age. I probably shoulda come sooner, but... I just hoped it would go away. You know? It's not like I’ve been... with anyone. Not for a long time. So, I figured... what could it be? But it just kept happenin'. And now it's botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months. And you haven't been sexually active recently. That’s helpful information. It’s good you came in now. We want to figure out what's going on and make sure you're comfortable. Has there been any pain associated with this, any burning or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really... just kinda... uncomfortable. And a little worried, to be honest. Itches sometimes, yeah, a little bit. Mostly just feels… wet. And like somethin’s not right. I don’t know what else to tell ya. I just want it to stop. It's embarrassin', ya know? A lady shouldn't have to worry about things like this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration and embarrassment, Ms. Genard. It’s perfectly reasonable to want this resolved. And you're right, it shouldn’t be something you have to worry about alone. Okay, so no significant pain, just discomfort and some itching. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve me taking a look at the area to see if I can identify the source of the leaking. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh... a look? Well... I suppose so. I don't like the sound of it, but... if that’s what you gotta do. Just... be quick, okay? And gentle. I'm an old lady, not made of rubber.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your concerns. I'll explain everything as I go. We'll just have you lie down on the exam table, and I’ll drape you to maintain your privacy. Before we start, do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm... never really thought about it. I don't think so. I use regular rubber bands sometimes, but they haven't bothered me. I don't use fancy stuff, just the regular kind. But I'm kinda sensitive to strong smells. Perfume and stuff. Makes my head ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We'll avoid anything heavily scented. Alright, if you're ready, we can get started. Just lie down on your back with your knees bent, and I'll bring the drape. Now, I'm just going to take a look at the external area. I may gently separate the labia to get a better view. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. I’m noting some mild redness and slight swelling around the vaginal opening. There's a small amount of clear fluid present. No visible signs of injury or infection at this time, but there is a distinct odor, as you mentioned. It appears to be a vaginal discharge. Is this something you’ve experienced before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… bad. I mean, redness and swelling? Never had that before. Used to be... things were just normal. Now everything’s fallin’ apart! I had a little somethin’ when I was younger, after the war, but it went away on its own. This feels different. It just feels wrong. And that smell... it's awful. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're concerned, Ms. Genard. The redness and swelling, along with the odor, do warrant further investigation. It’s good you came in. It could be a number of things, and we need to determine the cause. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to collect a sample of the discharge for testing. This will help us identify if there's an infection present, like a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A sample? Oh… Like… like a pee test? I hate those! But… I guess if you gotta do what you gotta do. Just… be quick, okay? And tell me what you’re doin’ so I don’t get too scared. It’s just… I’m an old lady, Doctor. Everything’s kinda… delicate.
DOCTOR: It’s not quite like a pee test, Ms. Genard. It’s a gentle swab of the discharge. I’ll use a small cotton swab to collect a tiny sample. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all, and it’s very quick. I’ll explain each step as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. I’m just going to gently insert the swab into the vagina and rotate it lightly to collect a sample. It will only take a few seconds. Alright, all done. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Ugh. That wasn't pleasant. But... over with now, I guess. So, what happens now? You gonna tell me what's wrong with me? Or am I just gonna sit here and worry? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bingo game on Friday, and I don't want to miss it!
DOCTOR: You were very brave, Ms. Genard. It’s over now. I’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results usually take about 2-3 business days. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I'm going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antifungal cream to apply topically. It’s unlikely to cause any harm even if it’s not a yeast infection, and it may provide some relief from the itching and discomfort. We’ll wait for the lab results to confirm the diagnosis, and then we can adjust the treatment plan if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A cream? Hmm. I don't like takin' a lot of medicines. Always have side effects, ya know? But... if it helps the itch, I guess I'll try it. What kind of side effects should I look out for? And how do I put it on? I haven’t used cream down there in… well, a long time. And what if it is somethin' serious? Like… like somethin' awful? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I’m an old lady, I’ve lived a long life. I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Genard. The cream is topical, meaning you apply it directly to the skin, so the side effects are usually minimal – maybe some mild burning or irritation. If you experience any significant discomfort, stop using it and let the nurse know. Regarding a serious diagnosis, it’s important to be realistic, but it’s also important not to jump to conclusions before we have the lab results. The most common causes of vaginal discharge are yeast infections or bacterial vaginosis, which are easily treatable. However, less common causes could include sexually transmitted infections or, rarely, more serious conditions. That’s why it’s so important to get a confirmed diagnosis. If it turns out to be something more serious, we’ll discuss all your treatment options and refer you to a specialist if needed. But let’s focus on getting the results first, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Lab results first. That makes sense. Just... don’t keep me waitin’ too long. I wanna get back to my bingo. And make sure the nurse explains everything clearly. I don’t understand a lot of that medical talk. And... thank you, Doctor. For not sugarcoatin’ it. And for bein’ patient with an old lady. It’s not easy havin’ these things happen. I think… I think that’s all. For now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Genard. I'm happy to help. The nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available, and she’ll be sure to explain everything in plain language. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’m going to have the nurse come in to give you the prescription and go over discharge instructions. Please let me know if you need anything else. And I hope you enjoy your bingo!
