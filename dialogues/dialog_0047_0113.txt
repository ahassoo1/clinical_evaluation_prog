DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. Going a bit too often, you see. Annoying, really. Especially when I’m trying to… what was I saying? Oh, yes. It's just... frequent. That's the word. Frequent trips to the little room.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Seems like… always? Or a long time, anyway. Maybe a few months? Hard to say, really. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps track of things. I… don’t bother with details. It hasn't bothered me too much, until recently.
DOCTOR: A few months of… always?
PATIENT: Yes, well, that's how it feels. I suppose it's gotten more frequent recently, if you want details. It used to be… manageable. Now, I find myself thinking about it more. And making more… stops. It’s a farm, you see. Can’t be running off to the… facilities… all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. Just… the need to go. It's uncomfortable, the urgency. Like a full tank that's not quite full, if you get my meaning. More… a pressure. And it interrupts things. It’s not painful, doctor, just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: No pain, just urgency and pressure. And is it worse at night?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… maybe. Yes, I believe I do get up once or twice a night. My wife complains about the light, you see. I don't like stumbling around in the dark. But it's not… every night. Just some nights. Though, it seems like more nights lately.
DOCTOR: Do you have any difficulty starting your stream when you go to urinate?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Goodness no! I can go when I need to go. I’m not… helpless, you know. It starts fine. It’s just… the frequency is the problem! It’s the constant… interruptions. Really throws off my schedule, trying to manage the farm.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Doctor, I don’t examine my urine, you know. I go to the bathroom. That's about it. It looks… yellow. And smells like… well, urine. Honestly, I have better things to do than analyze my… bodily fluids. My wife might notice something, she’s got a good nose for these things.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you drinking a lot of fluids?
PATIENT: Well, I drink water, yes. And coffee, of course. A farmer needs his coffee! But a lot? No, I don’t make a special effort. I drink when I’m thirsty. Nothing out of the ordinary, I assure you. Not like I'm guzzling gallons of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your medical record. I see here you’ve been treated for high blood pressure for some time. And… diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. That's… common, isn’t it? Pills for that. My wife handles the pills, mostly. Diabetes… oh, that. Years ago. They said I had a touch of it. Diet, pills… I don’t remember exactly. It's all a blur. Didn't cause me much trouble, honestly. Is that… relevant, doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Diabetes, even well-controlled, can affect your kidneys and bladder, leading to frequent urination. Let's do a quick exam, and then I’d like to order a urine test to rule out infection and check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More tests. Honestly, doctor. I just want this… urgency… to go away. But, alright. If you think it's necessary. Fine. Exam, then the test. My wife will be relieved to have a proper diagnosis, I suppose. She's the practical one. But don't keep me too long. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. It’s just to rule out any other underlying issues.
PATIENT: Neurological check? What's that got to do with my waterworks? Alright, alright. Just try to be quick about it. And be gentle, my back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Just relax. Deep breath in… and out. Anything feel tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there, yes. Not painful, exactly. More like… discomfort. It's always a little sensitive. Old farm injury, probably. Plenty of bumps and bruises over the years. But I’ve gotten used to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Relax your leg, please. And now the other one. Both seem normal. Alright, that’s enough for now. Let's get that urine sample, and then we can discuss the results. I'll leave you some privacy. There's a cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample.
PATIENT: Mid-stream? What does that even mean? Honestly, the things they make you do these days... Alright, alright. Cup, mid-stream. My wife will have to explain it to me. Just… try not to laugh.
