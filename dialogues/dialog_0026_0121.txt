DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I see. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while. Maybe… six months? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda slips away when you get to be my age, you know? It's not always bad, just… most of the time. Especially when it's windy. We get a lot of wind here.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Time does seem to speed up. And wind definitely doesn’t help dry eyes. Do you feel any pain with your eyes, or is it more of an irritation?
PATIENT: It's not pain, exactly. More like… scratchy. Like there’s sand in ‘em, even when there ain’t. And they get tired real easy. I used to be able to read all day, now… not so much. Makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, scratchy, sandy feeling, and fatigue… that’s helpful. Have you noticed any redness, blurry vision, or discharge from your eyes at all?
PATIENT: Blurry vision sometimes, yeah. Especially at night when I’m driving. Makes me nervous. Redness… I don’t think so. Not that I've noticed. And no… no discharge. Just dry. Real, real dry. I try to blink more, but it don't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried any over-the-counter eye drops, or anything else to try and relieve the dryness?
PATIENT: Eye drops? Yeah, I got some at the store. The kind for dry eyes. Didn't do much good. Felt good for a minute, then right back to being dry again. Waste of money, probably. I don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know you’ve already tried those. Sometimes they don’t quite cut it. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your eyes, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just be a simple exam to check for any irritation or other issues.
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. Whatever you gotta do. I just wanna get this fixed, if possible. I got things to do, you know? Don't wanna waste a whole day on this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pipolo. I'll be as quick as I can. Okay, looking straight ahead… Now, follow my penlight as I move it around… Good. And now, focus on your nose… excellent. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. There’s some mild dryness of the conjunctiva – that’s the clear membrane over the white of your eye – but no significant inflammation or obvious abnormalities. I also see a bit of… some mild corneal haze, but nothing major. It does appear you have moderate dry eye. The corneal haze is something we should keep an eye on, but doesn’t seem severe at this point. We need to figure out why your eyes are so dry. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis, or take any medications?
PATIENT: Arthritis, yeah. In my hands. Real bad on cold days. Makes it hard to work, sometimes. Other than that… no, nothin’ much. I take a little somethin’ for the arthritis, but that’s about it. Doctor gave it to me years ago. Don't remember the name of it now. Old age, you know. Names slip away.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very common. Arthritis can sometimes contribute to dry eyes, as it can affect tear production. Do you remember how you take the medication for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Pills. Little white pills. Take ‘em every morning. And… sometimes at night, if my hands are really achin’. Don't know the dose. Doctor told me a long time ago and I just… keep takin’ ‘em. I don’t like messin’ with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knowing what medication you're taking is very helpful. I’m going to access your electronic health record to see if we have a record of it. One moment, please. Okay, it looks like you are taking Naproxen 500mg twice a day for osteoarthritis. That can contribute to dry eyes, unfortunately. It's a common side effect. We can discuss options for managing that, perhaps lowering the dose or switching to a different medication. To get a better idea of the severity of your dry eye, I’d like to perform a simple test called a Schirmer test. It measures how much tear production you have. It's quick and painless – just a small strip of paper placed under your eyelid. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test, huh? Well, if you think it’ll help. I just want this fixed. Don't want to be blind or somethin’. So… yeah, go ahead. Quick, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, very quick. It won't take more than a couple of minutes. Okay, just relax and keep your eyes closed. Alright, let’s see… Your tear production is a bit lower than we’d like to see, which confirms the dry eye. It's not severe, but it's enough to be causing your symptoms. So, here’s what I recommend. First, we’ll try some artificial tears more frequently throughout the day, even when your eyes don't feel dry, to keep them lubricated. I'm going to write you a prescription for a specific brand that's preservative-free, as those are generally gentler on the eyes. Also, we’ll discuss a possible reduction in your Naproxen dosage, but I want to check with your primary care doctor before making any changes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Preservative-free? What’s the difference? And check with my other doctor? That'll take time, won’t it? I got things to do, like I said. I don’t wanna be comin’ back here a million times.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Preservatives in some eye drops can irritate your eyes over time, especially with frequent use. Preservative-free drops are gentler and less likely to cause irritation. And you’re also right about checking with your primary care doctor about the Naproxen. I want to make sure any changes to your medication are safe and appropriate for your overall health. It might take a few days for them to get back to me, but I’ll call you as soon as I hear back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a warm compress on your eyes for 5-10 minutes a few times a day. That can help stimulate tear production. And if your symptoms worsen or you experience any pain, redness, or blurred vision, please call the office right away. I'll also give you a written summary of these instructions, and a referral form to send to your primary care doctor. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Written stuff’s good. I forget things easy these days. Referral form too. That's good. Just… how long before these drops help? I need to be able to see to do my work. And… is this somethin’ that’ll never go away?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Mr. Pipolo. It’s hard to say exactly how quickly the drops will help. Some people experience relief within a few days, while others may take a week or two. It really depends on the severity of your dry eye and how consistently you use the drops. Unfortunately, dry eye is often a chronic condition, meaning it can come and go over time. It's not always curable, but it’s very manageable with consistent treatment. The goal is to keep your eyes lubricated and comfortable, and prevent any complications. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. And if your symptoms don’t improve, there are other options we can explore, such as prescription medications or procedures to help stimulate tear production. Here you go. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: I don't think so. Seems like a lot. Just… try the drops and see what happens. And… they said somethin’ about wind? Is there anything I can do about the wind? We get a lot of it here.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Pipolo. Wind is a major irritant for dry eyes. I recommend wearing wraparound sunglasses when you’re outdoors, especially on windy days, to protect your eyes from the air. They create a barrier that helps prevent evaporation. And if you're indoors in a dry environment, like with air conditioning or heating, a humidifier can help add moisture to the air. Alright. Well, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Pipolo. Take care, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
