DOCTOR: Hi Evann, welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I requested some forms? Regarding… planning for the future, should anything happen. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I want to be certain my wishes are known. Something about an Advance Directive, or a POLST form, perhaps? I’m not entirely certain of the correct name.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, absolutely. You’re thinking about advance care planning – very responsible of you! Both Advance Directives and POLST forms are excellent ways to ensure your wishes are respected. We can definitely get that sorted out for you today. Let me pull up your chart here… Evann Buoniconti, age 35. Okay, I see a note about wanting to discuss end-of-life planning. It's good you’re thinking about this now. Before we dive into the forms themselves, can you tell me a little bit about why you're starting to think about this now?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. It’s not a single event, precisely. Just… a growing awareness of… things. I’ve been divorced for some time now, and while amicable, it did make me consider… what if I were unable to make decisions for myself? I have no immediate family nearby, and few close friends. It just seems… prudent to be prepared. Honestly, much of it is simply a desire for peace of mind, I think. And a fear of being… a burden. Though, I’m struggling to articulate it properly. My thoughts feel… fragmented sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you’ve given this a lot of thought already, and it’s completely normal to feel a little fragmented when discussing something so personal and important. It’s very wise to be proactive, and wanting to avoid being a burden on others is a common and understandable concern. So, you’re thinking about what would happen if you were seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself. Let's clarify a few things. Are you currently experiencing any health issues that prompted this concern, or is it more of a general planning exercise?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing specific. I'm… generally healthy, I believe. I work as an etcher and engraver – it requires a steady hand and good eyesight, and I have both, thankfully. It’s more… preventative. A friend mentioned these forms after a rather unsettling conversation about a colleague's experience, and it stuck with me. I don't expect anything to happen, but… it feels better to be prepared, should the unexpected arise. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Evann. It’s always better to be prepared, and a colleague’s experience can certainly be a wake-up call. So, it’s a good thing you’re taking this step now. Okay, so we're focusing on advance care planning – specifically, ensuring your wishes are known regarding medical treatment if you become incapacitated. There are two main documents we can discuss: a Living Will, which outlines your preferences for end-of-life care, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which designates someone to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. Do you have any initial thoughts on who you might want to appoint as your healthcare proxy – the person who would make those decisions for you?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. As I mentioned, my circle is… small. I have a former colleague, Dimitri Volkov, who I trust implicitly. We worked together for many years, and he’s a very level-headed and compassionate individual. However… he lives several states away. I hesitate to place such a burden on someone so distant. I’m unsure if he would even be willing, or able, to fulfill such a role. I haven’t discussed it with him yet, to be honest. Perhaps… perhaps it’s presumptuous to even consider him without his consent.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right. It would be presumptuous to appoint someone without their consent, and considering the distance, it's good you're thinking through the practicalities. It's also very thoughtful of you to consider the burden you'd be placing on him. Okay, Dimitri Volkov is a potential healthcare proxy, but we need to confirm his willingness and ability. We can discuss alternatives as well, if needed. Let's talk about the Living Will first. This document outlines your wishes regarding things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and pain management. Do you have any strong preferences regarding any of those treatments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not specifically. I… haven’t given those details much consideration, to be honest. I suppose… I would want everything that reasonably could be done to preserve my life, if there was a genuine prospect of recovery. But… I have no desire to be kept alive artificially, indefinitely, if there is no hope. And I certainly wouldn't want to be a burden, should my quality of life be irrevocably diminished. It’s… difficult to articulate. I’m generally guided by the principle of… dignity, I suppose. Perhaps that’s not very helpful. I find myself struggling with the specifics of such scenarios. It all feels rather… abstract.
DOCTOR: That’s extremely helpful, Evann. “Dignity” is a wonderful guiding principle, and it's perfectly alright if the specifics feel abstract. Many people struggle with this. It sounds like you’re leaning towards a desire for aggressive treatment if there's a reasonable chance of recovery, but you don’t want prolonged life support without a meaningful quality of life. Okay, so we’re documenting a preference for aggressive treatment with a reasonable prospect of recovery, and a desire to avoid prolonged life support without a meaningful quality of life. We can phrase that more formally in the Living Will document. Do you have any religious or philosophical beliefs that might influence your medical care?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not… specifically. I was raised in a… secular household. I have no strong religious affiliations, and I don’t subscribe to any particular philosophical doctrine. I believe in… reason and compassion, I suppose. And I value autonomy above all else. I suppose that’s why I’m here, seeking to ensure my wishes are respected. Though… I confess, I’m not very well-versed in articulating such matters. I’m more comfortable with… practical concerns. With my work, for instance. Etching requires precision and a certain… directness. This feels… more nebulous. I apologize if I’m being unclear.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unclear at all, Evann. It sounds like you value your autonomy and want to make informed decisions about your care, which is excellent. And it's perfectly fine to be more comfortable with practical matters. We’re just trying to capture your general wishes, and “reason and compassion” are wonderful guiding principles. Okay, so documenting a preference for informed decision-making, guided by reason and compassion. Alright. So, we’ve discussed your preferences for treatment, your desire for autonomy, and your potential healthcare proxy. Before we proceed with drafting the Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney, let’s talk about POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. It's a medical order, signed by a doctor, that outlines your wishes for specific treatments. It’s generally used for people with serious illnesses. Do you think a POLST form would be appropriate for you at this time?
PATIENT: A… medical order? I thought the Advance Directive and the POLST form were… the same thing. I confess, I’m rather confused about the distinction. I understood the Advance Directive to be a general statement of my wishes, while the POLST form was… a more specific set of instructions for medical professionals. But perhaps I’m mistaken. As you can see, my memory is… unreliable. I struggle to keep such details straight. Would you mind explaining the difference in simpler terms? Perhaps with examples? I apologize for my ignorance, Doctor. It’s rather embarrassing.
DOCTOR: You’re not ignorant at all, Evann! It’s very common to be confused about the difference between Advance Directives and POLST forms. And you’re absolutely right in your understanding – you’ve actually got it mostly correct. Think of it this way: the Advance Directive – or Living Will – is like a letter outlining your overall values and wishes regarding medical care. It’s quite broad. The POLST form, on the other hand, is like a doctor’s order. It’s much more specific. For example, your Living Will might state you don’t want prolonged life support without a meaningful quality of life. But the POLST form would specifically state whether you want CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. POLST forms are generally used for people who are already seriously ill, to clearly communicate their wishes to healthcare providers in an emergency. Since you’re generally healthy and proactive in planning, a Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney are likely more appropriate for you at this time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that clarifies things considerably, Doctor. So the Living Will is a… general statement of intent, while the POLST form is a… concrete set of instructions. And since I’m not currently ill, the Living Will is the more appropriate option. I believe I understand now. Thank you for taking the time to explain it so patiently. It’s… reassuring to have a clear understanding of the distinctions. Though, I confess, the prospect of drafting such a document feels rather… daunting. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It is daunting, but we’ll take it one step at a time. The first step is to discuss your specific wishes in more detail. We’ll go through a series of questions to help you articulate your preferences regarding different treatments. There are no right or wrong answers, and you can change your mind at any time. Let’s start with resuscitation. If your heart stopped beating, would you want CPR performed?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I suppose… my initial instinct is to say yes. I would want everything reasonably possible to be done to preserve my life. But… I’ve also heard stories about the… trauma associated with CPR. The broken ribs, the complications… And if there’s truly no prospect of recovery… Would it be better to… allow nature to take its course? I confess, I’m torn. I’m not certain what my wishes would be in that scenario. Perhaps it would be best to… err on the side of caution and say yes, at least initially. But I’m not entirely comfortable with that answer. It feels… imprecise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to feel imprecise, Evann. It’s a very difficult decision, and it’s good you’re considering all aspects. You’re right to acknowledge both the potential benefits and the potential harms of CPR. Many people feel conflicted about this. It sounds like you're leaning towards wanting CPR attempted, but you have concerns about the trauma and the lack of benefit in certain situations. We can phrase it this way in the Living Will: “I want CPR attempted unless it is determined that there is no reasonable prospect of recovery.” Does that capture your wishes accurately?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… captures my wishes perfectly. "Unless it is determined that there is no reasonable prospect of recovery." That provides a reasonable safeguard, and acknowledges the… limitations of such interventions. It's… reassuring to have it phrased so clearly. I confess, I was worried about making a premature commitment, but that phrasing feels… appropriate. Perhaps we could explore similar safeguards for other interventions as well? The thought of… being subjected to prolonged, futile treatments is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That’s exactly what we’ll do. We want to capture your wishes as accurately as possible, and that means considering all possibilities and adding safeguards where appropriate. Let’s move on to intubation – that’s when a tube is inserted into your airway to help you breathe. Would you want a ventilator – a breathing machine – used if you were unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: That’s… another difficult question, Doctor. I suppose… my initial reaction is to say yes. I believe in utilizing all reasonable means to preserve life. But… I’ve also heard stories about the… discomfort associated with intubation. And the… prolonged dependence on a ventilator. If there was no prospect of recovery… or if my quality of life would be irrevocably diminished… I would not want to be subjected to such treatments. Perhaps… we could phrase it similarly to the CPR directive? “I want intubation attempted unless it is determined that there is no reasonable prospect of recovery, or my quality of life would be irrevocably diminished.” Does that sound reasonable? I confess, the prospect of making such decisions feels… overwhelming. But I appreciate your guidance, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Evann. It is overwhelming, and you're handling it with grace. And yes, that phrasing is perfect. "Unless it is determined that there is no reasonable prospect of recovery, or my quality of life would be irrevocably diminished." Okay, we’ve documented your wishes regarding CPR and intubation. Let's move on to artificial nutrition and hydration – that’s receiving fluids and nutrients through a tube. Would you want a feeding tube inserted if you were unable to eat or drink on your own?
PATIENT: That’s… a particularly difficult question, Doctor. I confess, I haven’t given much consideration to artificial nutrition. I suppose… my initial inclination is to say no, if there was no reasonable prospect of recovery. I believe in allowing nature to take its course, and prolonging life artificially in such circumstances seems… futile. But… I’ve also heard stories about the… distress associated with withholding nutrition. And the… comfort it can provide. Perhaps… it would be best to phrase it similarly to the previous directives? "I do not want artificial nutrition and hydration if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery and my quality of life is irrevocably diminished." Does that sound appropriate? Though… I confess, I’m growing increasingly anxious about making such definitive statements. I’m uncertain if I’m adequately articulating my wishes. It feels… daunting to contemplate such scenarios. Perhaps we could revisit these directives at a later date?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to pause and think carefully, Evann. And you are doing a remarkable job articulating your wishes, despite your anxiety. It’s perfectly acceptable – and often beneficial – to revisit these directives at a later date. We’re not rushing anything. And yes, “I do not want artificial nutrition and hydration if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery and my quality of life is irrevocably diminished” is excellent. That captures your preferences beautifully. Okay, we’ve documented your wishes regarding CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Now, let's talk about pain management. Would you want everything reasonably possible done to alleviate pain and discomfort, even if it might hasten your death?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Absolutely. Everything reasonably possible to alleviate pain and discomfort. That is… non-negotiable. Quality of life is paramount, and suffering needlessly is… unacceptable. Even if it means hastening my death, I would want to be comfortable and pain-free. There should be no hesitation in providing palliative care. That is… a fundamental principle. There is no need to elaborate further. That is… my unequivocal wish. I confess, that is the one directive I feel… entirely certain about. Perhaps… we could pause here for a moment? I’m growing increasingly fatigued. And I feel… emotionally drained. I appreciate your patience and guidance, Doctor. You’ve been remarkably understanding. Perhaps we could revisit the remaining directives at a later date? I need… a moment to collect my thoughts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That is perfectly alright. You’ve made significant progress today, and it’s completely understandable to feel fatigued and emotionally drained. We’ve documented your wishes regarding CPR, intubation, artificial nutrition, and pain management – which is a wonderful accomplishment. We can absolutely pause here and revisit the remaining directives at a later date. There’s no rush. Before we finish for today, let’s quickly review what we’ve discussed. Then, I’ll print out the draft Living Will for you to review. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… excellent, Doctor. A review would be… most helpful. And I appreciate your… flexibility. It’s… reassuring to know that I can revisit these directives at a later date. Thank you… for your patience and understanding. I confess, I was apprehensive about this process, but you’ve made it… remarkably manageable. Perhaps… a brief summary would be beneficial before we proceed with the draft? Just to ensure I’ve adequately articulated my wishes?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. I’m glad I could make the process more manageable. Okay, so to summarize: you want CPR attempted unless there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. You want intubation attempted under similar circumstances – unless there’s no reasonable prospect of recovery. You do not want artificial nutrition and hydration if there’s no reasonable prospect of recovery and your quality of life is irrevocably diminished. And, most importantly, you want everything reasonably possible done to alleviate pain and discomfort, even if it might hasten your death. Does that accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… accurately reflects my wishes. Precisely. That is… a perfect summary. I confess, hearing it articulated so concisely is… reassuring. It confirms that I’ve adequately conveyed my preferences. Thank you… for your patience and diligence. I feel… considerably more at ease now. Perhaps… could we discuss the next steps? Specifically, the process of formalizing this document? And the possibility of designating Dimitri Volkov as my healthcare proxy? Though, I understand that requires his consent, and I haven’t yet discussed it with him.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad you feel more at ease. Okay, let’s talk about the next steps. First, I’ll print out the draft Living Will for you to review. You can take your time to read it over, and we can make any necessary revisions at a later date. Once you’re satisfied with the document, you’ll need to sign it in the presence of two witnesses. I can provide the necessary forms and guidance. Regarding Dimitri Volkov, yes, you’re right – his consent is essential. He would need to agree to serve as your healthcare proxy and understand his responsibilities. We have forms for that as well, which he would need to complete. I can also provide him with resources to help him understand the role. We can also document his contact information in your chart. And, of course, I can provide you with a copy of the Living Will and the healthcare proxy designation for your records. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. A comprehensive plan. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Providing resources for Dimitri would be… most helpful. And having copies of the documents for my records is… reassuring. I confess, I was apprehensive about this process, but you’ve made it… remarkably manageable. Perhaps… could we schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss any revisions and finalize the documents? Though, I understand your schedule is likely busy. I’m flexible. Perhaps… in a few weeks? To allow me time to discuss this with Dimitri and review the documents thoroughly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. I’m glad I could alleviate your apprehension. Let’s see… I have an opening on August 16th at 2:00 PM, or August 23rd at 10:00 AM. Would either of those dates work for you?
PATIENT: August 16th at 2:00 PM would be… perfect, Doctor. That allows me ample time to discuss this with Dimitri and review the documents thoroughly. Thank you… for your flexibility. I confess, I’m… considerably more at ease now. Perhaps… could we finalize the arrangements for that appointment? And… perhaps you could provide me with some resources regarding advance care planning? To help me better understand my rights and responsibilities? I appreciate your… patience and guidance, Doctor. You’ve been remarkably understanding. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. I’m glad to hear that August 16th at 2:00 PM works for you. I’ve scheduled that appointment for you. Here are some resources regarding advance care planning, including information about your rights and responsibilities, as well as resources for healthcare proxies. I’ve also included a website with information about end-of-life care and legal considerations. I’ll also send you an email with digital copies of these resources. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
