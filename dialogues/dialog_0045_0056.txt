DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, good to meet you. I see you're 87 years young. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, if you must know… it’s this job. Honestly. All these… young people. Not respecting the order of things. It’s simply… draining. I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time. Long enough to know better than most, I assure you. And frankly, I’m rather busy. Can we expedite this?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. While I appreciate your… dedication, Mr. Schlatterer, we’re here to discuss your health. The stress of work can certainly impact that. But let's focus on you. Are you experiencing any specific physical symptoms – anything at all – that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. At my age, everything aches. It’s to be expected. I wouldn't bother you with… trivialities. It’s just… a general weariness. A lack of… enthusiasm. And honestly, it's these students. They simply don’t care about the Dewey Decimal System anymore. It's appalling. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have a rather important cataloging project waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, "general weariness" is a symptom. And it's important that we try to figure out what's causing it. It could be anything from something simple like dehydration, to something more serious. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you start feeling this weariness?
PATIENT: Dehydration? Doctor, I assure you I know how to drink water. I was born before indoor plumbing, you know. As for when… honestly, it’s been creeping up on me. Years, probably. It’s a gradual decline. It's probably just… old age. Honestly, I don't see what a doctor can do about that. Is there a form I can fill out to expedite this? I have a very precise schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your… frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. But even with age, there are things we can do to improve your quality of life. Let's rule out anything else contributing to this weariness. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… Well, I suppose I haven't been eating as… robustly as I once did. The food these days simply isn't what it used to be. And weight? I haven’t weighed myself in… goodness, decades. I have no need for such frivolities. It’s all rather… undignified. Look, Doctor, is this going to involve blood tests? Because I have a rather low tolerance for needles. And frankly, I’m wasting precious time here.
DOCTOR: Okay. We might need to do some basic bloodwork to get a clearer picture, yes. But let’s start with a quick physical exam first. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a brief neurological assessment. It won’t take long. Can we do that?
PATIENT: Neurological assessment? What are you implying, Doctor? That my mind is… failing? I assure you, I remember perfectly well the classification system for Bulgarian folklore. It’s… insulting, frankly. But… fine. Get it over with. Quickly, if you please. I have a rather important shipment of periodicals arriving this afternoon. And I need to ensure they are properly organized. Don't take too long, Doctor. My schedule is… quite tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. And I assure you, sir, this is standard procedure. Nothing to be alarmed about. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly faint murmur. Lungs are clear, but some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Anything you’ve been coughing up lately?
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? I assure you my lungs were perfectly adequate during my time in the reserves. A slight cough, perhaps. But only when the dust is particularly bad in the archive. It’s an old building, you know. And frankly, all this probing is making me rather anxious. Is this going to take much longer? I have a very precise cataloging schedule to maintain. And I simply must get those new acquisitions processed before closing time. This is… highly disruptive. Honestly, I preferred the old days. Doctors actually listened then.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Just follow my finger with your eyes. And try to squeeze my hand as tightly as you can. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but still present. Grip strength is weak, but adequate. No obvious signs of neurological deficits. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of age-related changes and some possible mild weakness. The faint heart murmur isn’t immediately concerning, but we should investigate further. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. Also, an EKG would be a good idea. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An EKG? Chest X-ray? Doctor, are you trying to frighten me? Honestly. This is… excessive. But… fine. If you insist. But I expect a thorough explanation of the results. And I simply must know how long this is going to take. I have a very important lecture to prepare for next week. Bulgarian literary criticism, you understand. It requires a great deal of… concentration. And I simply cannot afford to be… incapacitated. Can we at least schedule these tests for the afternoon? I have a rather precise schedule to maintain, you see. And frankly, I’m wasting precious time here. I’d like to know when I can expect the results, Doctor. Precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schlatterer. We can schedule those tests for this afternoon. The lab is right down the hall. The X-ray can be done immediately after. It should take about an hour, all told. The results will be sent to me, and I’ll have them reviewed by tomorrow morning. I’ll call you with the findings. I'm also going to write you a referral to a cardiologist, just to get a professional opinion on that murmur. It's likely nothing serious, but it's best to be cautious. While we wait for the results, I recommend getting some light exercise, if you're able, and focusing on a healthy diet. And please, try to reduce stress as much as possible. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Light exercise? Reduce stress? Doctor, you clearly don’t understand the pressures of maintaining a meticulously organized archive. It's… a delicate ecosystem. And frankly, I have no time for such frivolities. But… fine. A cardiologist. Whatever. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my schedule. Very well. I suppose that will be all. I trust these tests won’t take too long. And I expect a prompt and thorough explanation of the results. Precisely. Good day, Doctor. And please, don't bother calling me if it’s nothing serious. I have a very important lecture to prepare for. Bulgarian literary criticism, you understand. It requires… concentration.
