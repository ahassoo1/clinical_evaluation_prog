DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Delano Alcorta. It’s… adequate to meet you. I’m here regarding my vision. It's been… deteriorating, shall we say. It’s not a sudden thing, more of a gradual…dimming. I suppose that's the best way to put it. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta, I understand. A gradual dimming of your vision. That is inconvenient. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. First, could you tell me how long you've been noticing this deterioration?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. It’s not as though there was a specific day. Perhaps… six months? Possibly longer. Time does tend to… slip away from one as they get older, you know. Not that I’m old, mind you. But long enough to notice a difference, certainly. I used to be able to read the fine print on… well, on important documents without needing assistance. Now… not so much. And the television… a constant adjustment of the volume, you understand. It’s… distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand, six months or so, with a gradual worsening. Difficulty with reading fine print and needing the television volume louder – those are good details. Has this dimming been the same in both eyes, or has one eye been affected more than the other?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I hadn’t precisely compared them, if I'm honest. I suppose… the left eye feels… slightly more clouded. Though it’s difficult to be certain. I don’t go around covering one eye at a time, you understand. That seems… rather foolish. I’ve simply noticed things aren’t as sharp as they once were. A general… haziness, really. It’s not debilitating, yet. But I prefer to address these things before they become… problematic.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly more haziness in the left eye, but generally in both. That’s helpful. And you're right to address it now. Do you wear glasses or contact lenses currently?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Never have. Always had remarkably good eyesight, until recently, of course. My father had excellent vision, as did his father before him. It's… unusual, this decline. I’ve always prided myself on not needing corrective lenses. A sign of… good genes, you understand. Though clearly, something has gone awry. It’s rather concerning, to be perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Alcorta. It’s good that you’ve never had vision problems before, that does give us a baseline. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the dimming?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. Other symptoms… Well, now that you mention it, I have noticed… a few floaters, perhaps? Little… specks, drifting across my vision. Nothing constant, more… intermittent. And occasionally, a slight… shimmering. It’s difficult to describe. Like looking through heat waves, you understand? It doesn’t happen often, but it is unsettling. Aside from that… no, I don’t believe so. No pain, no double vision, no… flashing lights, or anything dramatic like that. Just the dimming, and these… minor annoyances.
DOCTOR: Okay, floaters and occasional shimmering – that’s good information. No pain, double vision or flashing lights is reassuring. Now, I’m going to ask some general health questions, if that's alright. Do you have any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Alright. Proceed. No, Doctor, I do not. Remarkably good health, all things considered. Always been quite careful with my diet, regular exercise… I haven’t had a serious ailment in… decades. A minor cold now and then, of course. But nothing… chronic. My doctor – my previous doctor, that is – always commented on my excellent constitution. Though I suppose that’s moot now, isn’t it? With this… vision problem. Still, I maintain a healthy lifestyle. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Alcorta. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Do you have any family history of eye problems – things like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that’s a difficult question. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about their medical histories, you understand? A rather… private bunch. My mother… I believe she wore glasses towards the end of her life, but I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… no, I don’t believe so. He had remarkably good vision, as I mentioned earlier. As for glaucoma, macular degeneration… no, I don’t recall anyone suffering from those conditions. It’s possible, of course. But I wouldn’t rely on my memory. A rather… unreliable organ, sometimes. Still, I believe my family was generally blessed with good eyesight. It makes this… situation all the more perplexing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history, or at least, not that you are aware of. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Never have been one for pharmaceuticals, you understand? I prefer to address my ailments… naturally. A bit of rest, a healthy diet… that’s usually sufficient. I might take an occasional aspirin for a headache, but that’s the extent of it. No supplements, no vitamins, no… potions or elixirs. I find most of them… rather unnecessary. A waste of money, really. I believe in letting the body heal itself. Though perhaps… my body is failing me now. It's a… disheartening thought.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Now, Mr. Alcorta, I'd like to do a quick eye exam. Just to get a better look and assess your vision. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Proceed. Though I must warn you, Doctor, my vision is rather poor at the moment. I might not be the most… cooperative patient. I’ll do my best, of course. But please, be patient. I pride myself on my… composure, but this deteriorating vision is… unsettling. Just… proceed with caution. And try not to shine any bright lights in my eyes, if you would be so kind. It’s… rather bothersome.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. No bright lights, I promise. First, could you please look straight ahead at that chart on the wall?
PATIENT: Alright. Let me see… Is that… an ‘E’? Or is it a ‘V’? It’s… rather blurry. I used to be able to read those charts with perfect clarity. It’s… frustrating, to be perfectly honest. Is that the largest letter? It seems… quite small. Are you certain I’m looking at the correct chart? It’s… difficult to tell. Please, do tell me if I’m making a fool of myself. I have a rather… sensitive disposition.
DOCTOR: No, you're not making a fool of yourself at all, Mr. Alcorta. And yes, that is the largest letter. Can you tell me what direction the legs of the 'E' are pointing?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… Are they pointing… to the left? Or perhaps… upwards? It’s… remarkably difficult to discern. They seem… fuzzy, indistinct. I’m afraid my vision is… quite poor at the moment. I hesitate to guess, lest I make a complete… spectacle of myself. Is that… too much pressure? Perhaps we should… reassess. I'm… rather uncomfortable. Is there a chair nearby? My legs are beginning to feel… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down. No pressure at all, Mr. Alcorta. Let's try something different. I'm going to use a handheld device to check your visual field – how well you see to the sides. It involves looking straight ahead while I present some lights in your peripheral vision. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Alright. A handheld device… Yes, I suppose I can manage that. Looking straight ahead… That shouldn't be too difficult. Though I must warn you, Doctor, my peripheral vision hasn’t been quite the same lately. Things seem… a bit dim around the edges. But I’ll do my best. Just… try not to startle me with any sudden movements, if you would be so kind. I’m rather… easily flustered. And please, do explain what you’re doing as you go along. I prefer to be… informed. It’s… reassuring, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I’m going to hold this device up and present some small lights. When you see a light, just say "yes". Don't blink, and try to keep your gaze fixed on the point directly in front of you. We'll start with your right eye. Okay… I'm seeing some mild deficits in the superior temporal quadrant of your right eye. And now, let’s check your left eye… Hmm. Similar findings on the left side. Moderate deficits in the superior temporal quadrant.
PATIENT: Deficits? Superior temporal quadrants? Doctor, are you… speaking a foreign language? I confess, I’m not quite following. I understand ‘dimming,’ I understand ‘floaters,’ but ‘quadrants’… it’s all rather… bewildering. Are you saying my vision is… worsening? I had hoped this was simply a temporary… inconvenience. Are these ‘deficits’ serious? And what, pray tell, does ‘moderate’ even mean in this context? I'm… rather distressed, you understand. I prefer clarity, Doctor. Simple, straightforward… explanations. Not… medical jargon. Is there a… chair with more comfortable cushions? My back is beginning to ache.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask for clarity, Mr. Alcorta. My apologies for the medical jargon. Let me explain in simpler terms. What I mean is that your peripheral vision – the area you see to the sides – is slightly reduced, particularly in the upper outer parts of both eyes. This is what we call “visual field deficits.” “Moderate” means the reduction is noticeable but not severe. It does suggest something is affecting your optic nerves, which connect your eyes to your brain. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a couple of tests: an Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT, to get a detailed look at the layers of your retina, and a visual evoked potential test to see how well your optic nerves are functioning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Optic nerves? Retina? Visual evoked… potential? Doctor, you’re… alarming me. I came in here complaining of a bit of dimming, and now you’re talking about optic nerves and… potentials. Is this… serious? Is my vision… failing? And these ‘tests’… will they be… uncomfortable? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical procedures. And what if these tests reveal… something dreadful? I prefer not to dwell on… unpleasant possibilities. Before we proceed any further, perhaps you could… summarize the likely causes of these ‘deficits’? Is this something… age-related? Or is it… something more sinister? And will these tests at least tell us why my vision is deteriorating? I need… reassurance, Doctor. Simply ordering tests without explanation is… unsettling, to say the least. And is there any chance this could be… a temporary condition? Perhaps simply requiring a change in diet, or… a bit more rest? I cling to… optimism, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your anxiety, and I apologize for not explaining things more clearly from the start. Let me address your concerns. Several things can cause these types of visual field deficits. Some are age-related, like glaucoma, which is increased pressure inside the eye damaging the optic nerve. Other possibilities include macular degeneration, which affects the central part of your vision, and optic neuropathy, which is damage to the optic nerve itself. Less common causes can include stroke or other neurological conditions. The tests I’m ordering will help us determine the cause of your deficits. The OCT is non-invasive – it uses light waves to create an image of your retina, like a scan. The visual evoked potential test involves wearing electrodes on your scalp while you look at a flickering screen. It measures how quickly signals travel from your eyes to your brain. Neither test should be painful, though the visual evoked potential test can be a bit tiring. It's too early to say definitively what's causing this, but we need to rule out the more serious possibilities. I certainly hope it’s not something sinister, and we'll do everything we can to find out. While a change in diet and rest are always good, they are unlikely to resolve deficits caused by optic nerve damage. Does that explanation help ease some of your anxiety?
PATIENT: Alright. Glaucoma… macular degeneration… optic neuropathy… It’s… a rather alarming list, Doctor. And while I appreciate your assurances, the possibility of… optic nerve damage is… disconcerting, to say the least. Very well. Proceed with your ‘tests’. But I must insist on… detailed explanations of the results. I require clarity, Doctor. No medical jargon, no… vague pronouncements. And if these tests reveal… something unpleasant, I expect a… comprehensive plan of action. I’m not one to simply… accept fate. I prefer to… actively manage my health. And please, do ensure these tests are… conducted with the utmost care. I’m rather… sensitive, you understand. And perhaps a… more comfortable chair? This one is… somewhat lacking in support.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. You have every right to ask questions, and I promise to explain everything in clear, understandable terms. I will personally review the results with you and discuss all your options, and we will create a plan of action together. I’ll make sure the tests are conducted with the utmost care and will speak to the technician about ensuring your comfort. I’ll also see if we can find you a more supportive chair. Before we proceed, I need to gather some basic information for the tests. Let me just confirm your date of birth and insurance details… Oh, it says here you are not insured. That’s alright. We can discuss options for financial assistance with the testing costs. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Insurance? That… is a rather personal question, Doctor. And frankly, irrelevant. My financial affairs are… confidential. Suffice to say, I am… capable of covering the expenses. No, I do not have any further questions at the moment. Proceed with your… tests. But I must reiterate: clarity, Doctor. Detailed explanations. And please, do not… patronize me. I may not be a medical professional, but I am… reasonably intelligent. Let us… get this over with. The sooner we have… answers, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I apologize if my question about insurance was insensitive. It was simply a routine inquiry. I assure you, I will proceed with the utmost respect and provide you with clear, detailed explanations every step of the way. Alright. If you’ll follow me, the technician will be right with you to perform the Optical Coherence Tomography. It will take about 20-30 minutes. Then, we’ll do the visual evoked potential test. Do you have any difficulty with flickering lights?
PATIENT: Flickering lights? Hmm. I hadn't precisely considered it. Perhaps… a mild sensitivity. Old age, you understand. Things become… more bothersome as one gets older. But I can… tolerate it, I suppose. Let us… proceed. The sooner we have answers, the better. And please, remind the technician to be… gentle. I’m rather… easily flustered. And do ensure the chair is… comfortable. One simply cannot… relax when one is uncomfortable. And Doctor? If this proves to be… something serious, I expect you to be… forthright. I prefer honesty, even if it’s… unpleasant. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Alcorta. I will be completely honest with you, even if the news isn't what we hope for. And I’ll do everything I can to support you through this process. Here we are. This is where the technician, Sarah, will be. I've already spoken to her about your concerns. I'll be nearby if you need anything at all. Please don’t hesitate to call for me. Just take a deep breath, and try to relax. Sarah will explain everything clearly. I’ll be right outside.
PATIENT: .
