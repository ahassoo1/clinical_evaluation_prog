DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s not really bringing me in, if you know what I mean. Just need to get some forms filled out for Medicare, that's all. Seems like they change ‘em every year!
DOCTOR: Yes, they certainly do seem to! Medicare forms can be… a bit much. I’m happy to help you with that. I do want to make sure we’re utilizing your visit to its fullest potential though, since you are here. Is there anything else at all – any health concerns, even if they seem small – that you'd like to discuss while we have this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I guess… my knees have been a little achy lately. Nothing terrible, just more of a bother than anything. Probably just getting older, you know? I work on my feet a lot, installing valves and stuff. It's physical work.
DOCTOR: I understand. Knee pain with physical work is quite common. "Achy" is a good way to describe it. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly when I’ve been bending and kneeling a lot, like when I’m hooking up the valves. It doesn’t really hurt when I’m just walking around, or sitting. It's more of a stiffness, especially in the mornings. And sometimes, at the end of the day, they feel a little swollen. Not badly swollen, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly with bending and kneeling, stiffness in the mornings, and some mild swelling at the end of the day. Has this been a gradual onset, or did it start suddenly after a particular incident?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It wasn't like one day it just started hurting. It's been getting a little worse over the last few months, slowly. I didn't really pay much attention to it at first, figured it was just a normal part of the job. But it's getting harder to ignore now.
DOCTOR: I see. And on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… at its worst, maybe a 4 or 5. It's not debilitating or anything, like I said. I can still get my work done. But it’s definitely there, and it makes it harder. I don’t like to complain, though.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s good you're letting me know even if it’s not debilitating. That's important. Now, have you tried anything to alleviate the pain – over-the-counter medications, ice, heat, or anything like that?
PATIENT: I’ve taken some ibuprofen sometimes, when it's really bothering me. It helps a little, but not for very long. And I’ve tried putting ice on them at night, but honestly, I forget a lot of the time. It’s just hard to remember after a long day.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – it’s easy to forget self-care after a busy day. Alright. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your knees. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don't mind, could you please sit on the edge of the examination table, and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to feel around your knees now. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay, I’m noting some mild tenderness on the inner aspect of both knees, and a very small amount of swelling, which you mentioned. Your range of motion is full, but there's a little bit of discomfort with full flexion. Do you feel that discomfort?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s about right. The bending one, that’s where it feels it the most. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like something’s catching a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, and I’m checking the stability of the knees now. Everything feels stable, which is good. No grinding or clicking that I can detect. Based on this exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early osteoarthritis, or possibly some meniscal irritation, but we’ll need some imaging to get a clearer picture. Would you be open to getting an X-ray of both knees?
PATIENT: X-ray… hmm. If that's what you think is best, then yeah, okay. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. An X-ray is a good first step. It will help us rule out any other issues and confirm what’s going on. I’ll write an order for that now. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use ibuprofen as needed, and trying to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain as much as possible. Also, if you're able, some low-impact exercises like swimming or cycling can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and provide some support. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. I can try that. I used to swim a little, might have to get back into it. I guess we should still get those Medicare forms done, huh? Before I forget why I even came here!
DOCTOR: Absolutely! We can certainly get those forms completed. And it’s good we addressed the knee pain as well. Let’s get the X-ray scheduled first, and then we'll tackle the paperwork. I'll have the receptionist schedule the X-ray for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point, about the knees, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. And for not making me feel silly about complaining about achy knees! I guess just… when should I expect to hear back about the X-ray results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It’s my job to listen, and there’s never a reason to feel silly about your health concerns. The radiologist usually takes 24-48 hours to read the X-rays. The receptionist will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. At that appointment, we'll discuss the findings and create a treatment plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Alright, then. Let's get those forms done! I’m sure they’re somewhere in that pile…
DOCTOR: Perfect. Let's get started. I’ll be right here if you have any questions as you fill them out. Don’t hesitate to ask. And again, thank you for coming in today.
PATIENT: .
