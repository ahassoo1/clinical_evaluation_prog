DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor. Right, well… it’s my ears, you see. They feel… blocked, sort of. Full. It’s been going on for a bit now, I think. Honestly, time… it slips away, doesn’t it? I just want it sorted, if that makes sense. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does have a way of doing that. "Blocked" and "full" are good descriptions. And it's perfectly alright that you don’t recall the precise start date. We’ll figure it out. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me if this fullness is in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Yes, both ears. It’s not… painful, exactly. Just… muffled. Like when you go swimming, maybe? But it hasn’t gone away. I don’t swim much these days, though. Not since… well, never mind. Both ears, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, both ears experiencing a muffled sensation, similar to being underwater. And no pain, which is good. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Other symptoms… Not that I recall. Maybe a little… dizziness sometimes? But I get dizzy easily, always have. I don't know if that's related. And… no, I don't think so. Nothing else springs to mind. It’s just the ears, really. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness, which you’ve experienced previously. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any changes to your hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… No, not really ringing. Maybe a very faint… whooshing? But it's hard to say. I often hear things, you know? Old house, lots of creaks and groans. And hearing… well, I’m not as sharp as I used to be. But that's just age, isn't it? I don’t think my hearing has suddenly worsened, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, and it’s good you’re able to differentiate between something new and the normal changes associated with age. A faint whooshing sound is good information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Well, I used to… I had my blood pressure checked regularly. It was fine, I think. And… my wife, bless her, she always took care of all that. Since she passed… it all gets a bit muddled, you see? I don’t really… I don't think so. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I have private insurance, if that helps.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It’s perfectly alright if details are difficult to recall, and I appreciate you sharing what you can. Losing a spouse is a significant event, and it's common for other things to feel less clear during that time. Private insurance is helpful information, thank you. Just to be complete, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… I think I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… no, I don't think so. Nothing else. I've never been a fan of hospitals, to be honest. Just the appendix, I think. A very simple operation. It wasn’t anything serious. Honestly, I'd rather not dwell on hospitals if I can avoid it. It brings back… memories.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Appendectomy in childhood, no other surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And my father… he had heart trouble. But that was a long time ago. I don’t really… we weren’t very close, to be honest. So I don’t know a lot about their medical history. Mostly just arthritis and heart trouble, if that helps. But I can’t give you specifics, I'm afraid. It’s all a bit vague.
DOCTOR: Alright, a family history of arthritis and heart trouble. That’s good to know. And it’s perfectly alright that the details are vague. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she didn’t approve. And truthfully, I never had the inclination. Always preferred a good cup of tea, myself. No, never smoked. And I don’t drink much either, if that matters. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always did the shopping, so she knew all that sort of thing. I suppose I could be allergic to something, but I haven’t noticed anything. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had an allergic reaction, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Very good. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez, thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll start by checking your ears with an otoscope. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An examination. Very well. If you must. Just… be gentle, please? My ears are rather sensitive, you see. And… quickly, if possible? I have… things to do. But yes, go ahead. Be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle and as quick as possible. I see some cerumen – that's earwax – present, but the ear canal appears clear. The tympanic membrane – that’s the eardrum – looks slightly dull, but there’s no obvious inflammation or perforation. Now, let's take a look at your left ear. Similar findings on this side – some cerumen, the tympanic membrane appears slightly dull, no inflammation or perforation visible. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs quickly just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If you must. But please, do hurry. This… poking and prodding isn’t terribly comfortable, you see? I suppose it’s necessary, though. Yes, go ahead. Quickly, if you would. My heart… it doesn't usually give me trouble. But… quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, it sounds like you may have a build-up of earwax, which is quite common, and possibly some mild fluid behind the eardrum. The slight dullness of the eardrum supports this. The dizziness could be unrelated, or it could be a result of the fullness in your ears affecting your balance. Do you have any questions about what I've said so far?
PATIENT: Earwax… and fluid? Is that… serious? Will I need… operations? I just want it fixed, you see. I don’t want any fuss. And… will it affect my hearing permanently? I rely on my hearing, you know. I suppose it’s not ideal, is it? This… wax and fluid. Is there a simple solution?
DOCTOR: No, it's not serious at all. These are very common issues and usually easily treatable. We certainly won’t jump to operations immediately! In most cases, we can start with a simple earwax removal. We can try a gentle irrigation procedure, or if that doesn't work, I can manually remove the wax with specialized instruments. As for the fluid, it may resolve on its own, or we can try some nasal decongestants to help open up the Eustachian tubes and allow it to drain. It's unlikely to affect your hearing permanently, especially if we address it now. Prolonged fluid buildup can cause temporary hearing loss, but that’s usually reversible. We’ll monitor your hearing closely, of course. Would you be comfortable trying the earwax removal first?
PATIENT: Earwax removal… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t involve… much poking. And as long as it’s quick. I really must get back. Yes, alright. Earwax removal. But gently, please. And quickly. I just want it… sorted. What does it involve, exactly? Will it be painful? I don't have a high pain tolerance, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll proceed gently. The procedure itself usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We'll use a warm water solution delivered with a syringe. It may feel a little strange, like a gentle pressure or bubbling sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. If you feel any discomfort at all, please let me know immediately, and we'll stop. I'll also prescribe a nasal decongestant to help clear any fluid in the Eustachian tubes. If the decongestant doesn't improve the fluid buildup after a week, we can discuss other options, such as a short course of steroids. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Steroids… Oh dear. I don't like the sound of steroids. But… earwax removal and decongestant first, yes. As long as the steroids are a last resort. And as long as it doesn’t take too long. I really must get home. Yes, alright. Earwax removal and decongestant. But gently, please. And quickly. Can we do it now? I have… appointments, you see. Very important appointments.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can proceed now. I assure you we’ll take it slowly and gently. I'll have a nurse prepare the earwax removal supplies, and we'll get started as soon as possible. Nurse, could you please come in and assist with the earwax removal for Mr. Guerrerolopez?
PATIENT: Right. Very well. Let's… get it over with, then. Quickly, if you would. I do hope this works. I have… things to do, you see. Important things. And I really don't want any fuss. Quickly, please.
