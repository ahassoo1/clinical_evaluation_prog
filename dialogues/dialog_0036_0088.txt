DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've been having this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That can be quite disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. It's… hard to explain. It’s not a loud ringing, exactly. More like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it sounds like… static, you know? Like on an old TV. It comes and goes. Mostly when it’s quiet, I think. It's really annoying when I'm trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. A high-pitched whine or static that comes and goes, worse with quiet – that helps me get a better picture. Has this been constant since it started, or has the type of sound changed over time?
PATIENT: It’s definitely changed. When it first started, maybe a month ago, it was just a very faint ringing. Barely noticeable. Now it's… more frequent, and sometimes the whine is louder. And yeah, the static started a few days ago. It’s weird. I can’t really pinpoint anything that makes it worse, other than quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's progressed over the last month, starting as faint ringing and now including a high-pitched whine and static. And quiet seems to be the main trigger. Have you noticed it in one ear specifically, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it's mostly in my right ear. But sometimes it's hard to tell, you know? Like it's moving around. I haven’t really paid super close attention, to be honest. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's good you're bringing it to my attention now. Okay, mostly in the right ear, sometimes difficult to pinpoint. Have you experienced any hearing loss recently, or noticed any dizziness, fullness in your ears, or pain?
PATIENT: No, no hearing loss that I’ve noticed. And no dizziness or pain, thankfully. My ears don’t feel full or anything like that either. Just… the ringing. It's just really distracting. I work as a waiter, so I need to be able to hear people. It makes things harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, no hearing loss, dizziness, or pain, and no feeling of fullness. It’s understandably concerning that it's impacting your work. Let’s go through a little bit more of your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Um… I had ear infections as a kid, I think. Lots of them, actually. When I was little. But not since I was maybe ten years old? I don’t really remember exactly. It was a long time ago. Nothing serious, just normal kid stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of ear infections as a child, but none recently. Do you have any other medical problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat okay, I don't smoke, and I only drink sometimes. I had a divorce a couple years back, so that was stressful, but other than that, nothing major. I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And thank you for sharing that – it’s helpful context. It's good you're generally healthy. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, if needed. Nothing else. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And no allergies to any medications or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any allergic reactions to anything, ever, thankfully. I get mosquito bites like everyone else, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Jaylyne, let's do a quick exam of your ears, nose and throat. It’ll just take a few minutes. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside your ears, and I'll also check your hearing a little bit with some basic tests. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let's just get this over with, if you don't mind. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your ear canals look clear, no sign of wax buildup or infection. The eardrums themselves appear normal in color and shape, no perforations that I can see. Your Weber test is midline, and your Rinne test is normal in both ears. So your hearing seems relatively intact based on this quick assessment, but it’s not a substitute for a full audiogram. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I touch around your ears or jaw?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. You can poke around as much as you need to. Seriously, no discomfort. It's just… annoying. Still there, that ringing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness to palpation. Alright, Jaylyne, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you likely have what we call tinnitus. That’s just the medical term for ringing in the ears. It’s very common. Often, it’s related to exposure to loud noises, even if it’s not something you remember specifically, or stress. Sometimes, it can be caused by something else, but based on what we've discussed, that seems less likely in your case. Given your history and the exam, I don’t think there’s an immediate, serious cause for concern, but we should rule out some other possibilities. I'd like to order a basic audiogram, a hearing test, just to get a more detailed picture of your hearing levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, tinnitus… that sounds… less scary than I thought. A hearing test sounds good. Yeah, definitely. I want to know what’s going on, and if a hearing test can help, then let’s do it. Where do I go for that?
DOCTOR: Great. The audiogram can be done right here in the clinic, and I can get an order sent to the audiology department immediately. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, there are a few things we can try to manage the tinnitus. Avoiding loud noises as much as possible is a good start. Stress management techniques – like deep breathing exercises or meditation – can also be helpful. There are also some apps and online resources that can provide sound therapy to help mask the ringing. I can send you some links after this appointment. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable in the meantime?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Avoiding loud noises, stress… I can try that. Apps… alright, I’ll look into those. Links would be great, thank you. To be honest, just knowing it’s probably not something serious is a big relief. I just… I want to get back to normal. This is making my job really hard. Is there anything right now I can do? Like, some kind of trick to make it quieter?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s frustrating when it interferes with your daily life. For a quick fix, sometimes focusing on other sounds can help distract you from the ringing. Listening to calming music or white noise can be useful. You can even try a fan or a humidifier. Another trick is to gently massage the area around your ears and jaw. It can sometimes help relieve tension and reduce the perception of tinnitus. It’s not a cure, but it might provide some temporary relief. I’m also going to write you a note excusing you from work for a few days, so you can get some rest and schedule the hearing test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, calming music, massage… I can try that. And a note for work… that would be amazing, thank you. Seriously, that would take a lot of stress off. I'm really grateful. I think that's all I need for now. Just the note and those links, and I'll get the hearing test scheduled as soon as I can. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Here’s the note for your work. It excuses you for three days, recommending you follow up with audiology. I’m also sending those links to your patient portal now, along with information about tinnitus. Please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get to the bottom of this and find a way to manage it. Have a good day, and try to relax.
