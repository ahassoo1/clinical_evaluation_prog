DOCTOR: Right, well… let’s get this over with. You’re Jailia, 18 years old. Why are you here today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Ruocco. It is Jailia Chakka. I am here because I am… quite concerned about my weight. And frankly, I’m also terribly fatigued, constantly. It’s… unsettling. And the night sweats are rather inconvenient, to say the least. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s impacting my daily life.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately three weeks, Doctor. It began subtly, a bit of restlessness at night, but it has progressively worsened. I awaken soaked in perspiration several times each week. It’s… disruptive. And it's not as though I'm exerting myself physically; my work is primarily sedentary. Are you noting all of this? It feels rather important.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve got a waiting room full of people who actually have problems. Sedentary work… night sweats… Right. And what exactly do you do for work?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I am a graphic designer. I create visual concepts, using computer software. It requires… precision and focus. My husband handles the business aspects, thankfully. It’s a rather demanding field, despite the lack of physical exertion. I find it… frustrating that you seem to dismiss it as unimportant. It requires significant mental energy. Are you suggesting my profession isn’t a valid cause for concern?
DOCTOR: Look, I didn’t say that. It just doesn't scream "medical emergency," alright?
PATIENT: With all due respect, Doctor, I believe my assessment of my health concerns is rather valid. The fatigue is debilitating, and the night sweats are… concerning. It is impacting my ability to perform my work, and frankly, it’s quite distressing. Perhaps a thorough examination would be more productive than questioning the legitimacy of my concerns. I have private insurance, if that is of relevance.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just get this over with. Have you had any… relevant past medical history?
PATIENT: Relevant past medical history? Doctor, I’ve always been quite healthy. No serious illnesses, no surgeries. A standard childhood immunizations, of course. I did have a rather unpleasant bout of food poisoning during a trip to Pokhara last year, but that resolved completely. My husband insists I take a daily multivitamin, though I'm not entirely convinced of its efficacy. Are you referring to a family history, perhaps? My mother has mild hypertension, controlled with medication.
DOCTOR: Hypertension… right. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. To food, medications, pollen… nothing of that nature. I have a rather sensitive nose, prone to seasonal irritation, but that is hardly an allergy. I have never experienced a severe allergic reaction. It is… rather frustrating that you are asking such basic questions when I am experiencing legitimate distress. Are you making any notes of my responses? I would like to ensure everything is being properly documented.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m documenting, alright?
PATIENT: I simply wish to be certain, Doctor. Now, concerning the fatigue and night sweats… have you noticed any other symptoms? Perhaps weight loss, changes in appetite, fever, chills… anything at all that might be relevant? I am attempting to provide a comprehensive account, but I require you to actively listen and acknowledge my concerns. I wouldn't be here if these were minor inconveniences.
DOCTOR: Weight loss?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have lost weight. Approximately five kilograms, over the past three weeks. It wasn’t intentional. My appetite is… variable. Some days I have no desire to eat, and other days I find myself eating less than usual, even when I am hungry. It is rather concerning, as I generally maintain a consistent weight. My husband has also remarked on it, though he tends to focus more on the financial implications of needing to purchase new clothing. Are you documenting that as well? It feels important to note the rapidity of the weight loss.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Five kilograms… variable appetite… Right. Any medications you're taking currently, besides this… multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the aforementioned multivitamin, which, as I stated before, I question the efficacy of. I do not regularly take any prescription medications. Occasionally, I will take ibuprofen for a headache, but that is infrequent. My husband encourages me to take herbal remedies, but I am rather skeptical of those as well. It’s quite frustrating that you continue to focus on insignificant details when I am clearly experiencing a concerning decline in my health. I find myself growing increasingly anxious about this entire situation. Are you prepared to conduct any actual examinations?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's get this over with. Stand up. Let's take your vitals. And try to relax. You’re making this unnecessarily difficult. Pulse is… elevated. 98. Blood pressure… 130 over 80. Not ideal. Lungs are clear. Now, let me see your throat. Say "ah."
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. “Ah.” I assure you, this is quite unsettling. The elevated pulse is hardly surprising, given my level of anxiety. And I reiterate, I am experiencing legitimate distress, not merely fabricating symptoms. Is the examination revealing anything of substance? Or are we simply documenting superficial observations? I trust you are employing sterile equipment? I would prefer not to contract any additional ailments during this consultation.
DOCTOR: Nothing remarkable. Temperature is normal. Lymph nodes… slightly enlarged. Probably nothing. Now, I'm going to order some basic blood work. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests… Just to rule things out. Don’t worry, it’s routine. You're probably just stressed. Most likely. Come back in a week to discuss the results. And try to get some rest. Next patient!
PATIENT: “Routine,” you say? Despite my explicitly expressed concerns, and the documented weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, this is merely “routine”? I find that… profoundly dismissive. And to attribute my condition to “stress” without conducting any thorough investigation is… frankly, unacceptable. Are you certain these tests are comprehensive enough to determine the cause of my symptoms? I expect a detailed explanation of each test and the rationale behind ordering them. And will these tests rule out any serious underlying conditions? I have private insurance, so cost is not an immediate concern, but I wish to ensure a thorough assessment. I suppose I will return in a week, but I must confess, I am leaving this consultation with considerable apprehension. .
