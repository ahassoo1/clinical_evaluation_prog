DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about this…this weakness. And this awful habit I’ve developed. It's embarrassing, really. I just…feel so tired all the time, and I keep wanting to eat dirt. Yes, dirt. Not like I want to, you understand. It just…calls to me. It’s ridiculous. And I’m not a ridiculous woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to discuss things that feel embarrassing, and I assure you, we’ll approach this with sensitivity and understanding. The weakness and fatigue are certainly concerning, and the urge to eat dirt…that’s something we’ll definitely need to explore further. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it started…oh, goodness, maybe six months ago? Just feeling…dragged. Like I’m wading through mud all day. It’s not like I’ve been doing anything strenuous, you know? I mostly just potter around the house. And it’s gotten worse, obviously. Now, even getting up the stairs feels like climbing a mountain. I used to be so active! I could walk for miles. Now…forget it. And the dirt eating…it helps, a little. A very little. It’s just…a craving. Don’t ask me why.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressing over about six months, starting with just feeling generally fatigued, and now impacting your ability to do everyday activities like climbing stairs. And you mentioned the urge to eat dirt provides some, albeit limited, relief. To clarify, Ms. Hardenburgh, when you say “dirt,” could you describe what kind of dirt?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t make me elaborate on this! Honestly. It’s…well, mostly the red clay from my garden. It's not like I'm eating just any dirt, you know? It has to be smooth. And not too many pebbles. I even sift it, sometimes. Don't judge me. It’s not a big amount, but enough to…satisfy the feeling. I know it’s strange. I haven’t told anyone. Not even my sister. She’d think I’ve lost my mind. And frankly, I think I might be.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I assure you, I am not here to judge. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable sharing everything with me so we can get to the bottom of this. The specific type of clay is helpful information. And it’s good that you are being mindful about sifting it. Now, let’s talk a little more about this fatigue. Does it come and go, or is it pretty constant?
PATIENT: Constant. Absolutely constant. There are no good days, you understand? Even when I’ve had a full night’s sleep – and I do sleep well, thankfully – I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. It’s…draining. It’s affecting everything. I can’t concentrate, I’m forgetting things…well, more than usual, anyway. And I just have no energy. No motivation. It’s dreadful. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s just old age. That’s what my neighbor said. She said it’s just what happens when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant fatigue, even after a full night’s sleep, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of motivation. It's good you've been noticing these changes. While it’s true that energy levels can naturally fluctuate with age, it's important to rule out any underlying causes. Now, Ms. Hardenburgh, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and the urge to eat dirt?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think…well, my stomach has been a bit…off. Not painful, exactly. Just… unsettled. And I've been feeling cold a lot. Even when it's warm outside. And my skin feels…dry. Very dry. I put lotion on constantly, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Oh, and I get headaches, sometimes. Dull headaches. Nothing terrible, but they’re there. I suppose that’s about it. Honestly, it’s probably all connected, isn't it? It's just…everything seems to be falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so unsettled stomach, feeling cold frequently, dry skin despite using lotion, and occasional dull headaches. Those are all potentially relevant pieces of the puzzle. To get a more complete picture, Ms. Hardenburgh, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I begin? I haven't been to a doctor in…well, ages, truthfully. I used to have high blood pressure, years ago. But it was well controlled with medication. I stopped taking the medication a long time ago, though. The doctor said it was fine. I had a hysterectomy when I was 40. Nothing else…I don’t think. I haven't been seriously ill, ever. I eat fairly well, mostly. Lots of vegetables. And I don't drink or smoke. I'm a sensible woman, you understand. And I certainly don’t go around eating dirt if I could help it. It’s just…this weakness. It's driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. So, a history of high blood pressure that was previously controlled with medication but is now off medication, and a hysterectomy at age 40. And you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. Do you know what the medication was for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Honestly, it was so long ago. Let me think… I believe it was…hydro…something. Hydrochlorothiazide, perhaps? Yes, that sounds right. A little white pill. I took it for years, and then the doctor said my blood pressure was fine and I could stop. It was Dr. Abernathy. He retired years ago, now. A very nice man. I can’t remember much else about it, truthfully. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. It just makes me feel… sluggish. And this weakness makes me sluggish enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hydrochlorothiazide. That’s very helpful. And I understand your preference to avoid medication when possible. Now, Ms. Hardenburgh, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No. None at all. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I’ve handled all sorts of plants. Nothing bothers me. I’m a very sturdy woman, you see. I’m not one of these delicate types. Honestly, I’m starting to think this whole thing is just in my head. Maybe I’m just getting old and need to accept it. But this weakness…it's just so debilitating. It’s driving me absolutely mad. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, that is not too much to ask at all. And while it’s good that you haven't experienced any allergies, and I appreciate your resilience, we shouldn’t dismiss these symptoms as simply “getting old.” It's important to investigate the cause of the weakness, the fatigue, and the urge to eat dirt. To help me do that, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – experienced similar symptoms, or had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a difficult question. My mother…she was always a bit frail. She had trouble with her digestion, all her life. And she was always tired. But she never ate dirt, thankfully. My father was a very strong man. A farmer. He lived to be 85. He never had any serious illnesses. My sister… she’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. She lives in Florida, and we don’t see each other very often. She’s not one for doctors, either. Honestly, my family isn't much for talking about illnesses. It’s just not done. We just…get on with things. But no, I can’t think of anyone else who had these sorts of symptoms. It’s just me. And frankly, I’m starting to worry about it. This weakness…it's just getting worse and worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. So, a family history of digestive issues in your mother, but otherwise generally healthy. Now, to get a better understanding of your lifestyle, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
