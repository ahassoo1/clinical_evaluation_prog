DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my stomach. Bloated, okay? Feels…full. Like I ate way too much, but I haven’t. Just…bloated. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand you're pressed for time, and we’ll certainly get straight to the point. Bloating can be quite uncomfortable. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start… Honestly? I don't really remember. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It's not like it's constant. Look, I work, alright? Pile driving. Not a lot of time to sit around thinking about when my stomach puffs up. Does it matter? It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand your work is demanding, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t have a precise timeline. Knowing it’s been a few weeks and comes and goes is helpful. And yes, it does matter, as it helps us narrow down the possibilities. Could you describe the bloating a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It feels… tight. Like my stomach is going to burst. Not painful, exactly, just… full of air, I guess? And gassy. A lot of gas. It’s embarrassing, honestly. I don’t need to go into details, do I? It's just… unpleasant. And it happens after I eat, usually. Not always, but mostly. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Tightness, fullness, gas… and mostly after eating. That gives us a good starting point. Now, are there any specific foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific foods? Look, I eat what I eat. I’m not one of those guys who pays attention to every little thing. Burgers, fries, sometimes steak… whatever’s quick, really. I don't think I’ve noticed anything specific. Maybe… beans? Yeah, beans don’t usually sit well. But I don’t eat them that often. Honestly, I don’t sit around analyzing my food like some kind of scientist. Is that what you want me to do?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kristofik, I don’t expect you to become a food scientist. I'm simply trying to identify any potential triggers. So, beans sometimes cause trouble, and otherwise it's a fairly standard diet. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. Not really. I get tired, but I always get tired. Pile driving’s hard work, alright? I mean, that’s just part of the job. Sometimes… I guess my stomach gurgles a bit. Loudly. But that’s probably just the gas. And… no, that’s it. I don’t go looking for problems, doc. I just want this bloating to stop. Look, is there a pill you can give me or what? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution, Mr. Kristofik. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this. The fatigue could be related to your work, or it could be something else, so we'll keep that in mind. Now, regarding your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Ugh. Look, my wife… she took care of all that stuff. She passed away a few years back. I don’t really… remember what she told me I had, if anything. High blood pressure, maybe? Something like that. I take a pill for it, I think. A little white one. I just… take it. Honestly, I’m not good with remembering details. It’s been rough since she’s gone. Does it matter? I’m here about my stomach, not… everything else.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife’s passing. It’s completely understandable that you wouldn’t be focused on medical details at this time. High blood pressure is good to know, and the fact that you're taking medication for it is important. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No! Look, I told you, I don't remember these things! It’s a little white pill, okay? That’s all I know. I just take it every morning. She used to fill the pill organizer for me. Now I just… grab one. I'm a pile driver, not a pharmacist! I don't need to know what’s in every single pill I take. Is this really important? Can we just get back to the stomach thing? I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Kristofik. You’re right to be frustrated, and I shouldn’t press you on details you don’t remember. A little white pill, taken for blood pressure… we'll make a note of that. Let’s shift back to your stomach. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Look, I don't want to talk about this! This is ridiculous. I'm here about bloating, not… that. I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? Is that good enough? I don't need to give you a detailed report on my… everything. I'm a grown man. Can we just get a prescription for something? I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for asking personal questions. You are absolutely right, you don't need to share details you're not comfortable with. Given your frustration and the limited information, and to rule out anything serious, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
