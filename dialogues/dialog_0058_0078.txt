DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a little difficult to explain. I feel like I need a… a reset, perhaps? Or a jumpstart. I just don’t feel quite right. I’m not sick, exactly, but I’m not well, you understand?
DOCTOR: A “reset,” hmm. That’s… not a medical term I often hear. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: I realize that sounds… vague. It’s just… everything feels a little dull. My energy is low, I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to, and I’m just… not enjoying things the way I once did. It’s not a sudden change, it’s been building for a while, I think. Perhaps a little bit like a car that needs a tune-up? I apologize for the continued non-medical descriptions. I just… I’m not good with the technical terms.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to get a bit more concrete. You mentioned low energy and trouble sleeping. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say precisely… I would say, at least six months, maybe longer? It started gradually, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. Then the sleep started to become… less restful. I wake up feeling like I haven't really slept at all, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. And now… well, I find myself just not looking forward to things as much. It’s rather frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not that I’ve noticed, specifically. Perhaps a little more… forgetful than usual? Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, the name of an acquaintance… nothing major. And sometimes, just a general feeling of… being overwhelmed, I suppose. But that could just be life, you know? I work with my hands a lot, shaping things… it requires a lot of focus. It’s not necessarily a symptom, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's go through a quick review of systems. Do you have any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is about the same as always, I suppose. I eat fairly regularly, though perhaps not as healthily as I should. I enjoy a good arepa, you know? And a little bit of chocolate now and then. I haven't noticed any significant changes in how much or what I eat, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any problems with your bowels?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? Everything is… regular, I suppose. No major issues there. I apologize if that’s not a helpful answer. It’s just… a little awkward to discuss.
DOCTOR: Right. And any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Sometimes… a little bit of stiffness in my shoulders and back. From the work, you know? Shaping the clay and… well, it's physical work. Not a sharp pain, just… achy. And occasionally, a little bit of a headache, but nothing that a little rest doesn't fix. It’s probably just from straining my eyes. I do a lot of intricate work, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not regularly. I have some ibuprofen for aches and pains, when I need it. And sometimes, a little something for a cold, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just over-the-counter things, you understand? I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if it can. And I have Medicare, so I try to avoid unnecessary visits and prescriptions, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I haven’t had any adverse reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past. That’s another reason I’m hesitant to start taking anything regularly, you see? I don’t want to risk a reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. As an adult… I had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, many years ago. It required a C-section. But I recovered well, thankfully. And… I had my appendix removed about ten years ago. But that was all straightforward, really. Otherwise, nothing major. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything else, and I rarely even visit the doctor, to be honest. That's why I'm not sure what's happening now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit complicated. My mother… she had some heart trouble when she was older. High blood pressure, mostly. And my father… he had diabetes. He wasn’t very good about taking care of himself, I’m afraid. As for my siblings… my sister is perfectly healthy, thankfully. And my brother… he had some issues with his kidneys, but he’s managing it, thankfully. It’s not a particularly healthy family, to be honest. Which is probably why I worry so much about my own health.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Well… I’m married, as you know. My husband and I have lived in this area for many years. I work from home, shaping clay and casting… it’s a quiet life. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I don’t really have much of a social life, to be honest. We mostly keep to ourselves. It's a simple life, but a happy one. Is that helpful? I’m not sure what you’re looking for, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Pitzel. Let me just quickly examine you. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your reflexes. Just a quick look to rule out anything obvious. Can you please sit up and lean forward?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I should have worn something more… practical. This scarf is rather cumbersome, isn't it? But please, proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Can you cross your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, there we go. Though my knees aren’t quite what they used to be, I must admit. A little bit stiff. Is that something to worry about, Doctor? Perhaps it’s just the age… or the work. It’s rather cold in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not drastically. Nothing immediately concerning. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, everything seems… normal, physically. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, sleep disturbances, forgetfulness – and your normal physical exam, it's possible you are experiencing early signs of perimenopause. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, and often presents gradually, as you've described. Or, it could be related to stress and vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, thyroid panel, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. That will help us rule out any underlying medical issues and give us a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Perimenopause… Oh. I hadn’t… I hadn’t considered that. It’s been many years since my last child, and… well, I suppose it is a possibility. It’s just… I hadn’t associated those symptoms with it, specifically. Blood work sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, let’s do the blood work. Anything that might help us figure this out, I’m willing to try. And… what does that mean, exactly? If it is perimenopause? Are there… treatments? I apologize for all the questions, but I’m rather out of my depth with all of this.
DOCTOR: It's alright to ask questions, Ms. Pitzel. It’s my job to explain things. Perimenopause is the transition period leading up to menopause. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, mood changes, and difficulty concentrating. The blood work will help us confirm if that’s what you’re experiencing. If it is perimenopause, there are treatments available. Hormone therapy can help alleviate some of the symptoms, but it’s not right for everyone. There are also lifestyle changes that can help – regular exercise, a healthy diet, stress management techniques. We can discuss those options once we have the blood work results. I’ll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab at the clinic down the street. They should be able to get the results back within a few days. Do you have any questions about where to go, or how to prepare for the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage that. The clinic down the street… yes, I know where that is. No special preparation, I presume? Fasting isn't necessary? I just… I don’t want to complicate things unnecessarily. Hormone therapy… that sounds… rather serious. Perhaps we can explore the lifestyle changes first. I’d rather try those before resorting to medication, if possible. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing there are options.
DOCTOR: No fasting required. And you're right to want to start with lifestyle changes. We’ll explore those first. Hormone therapy is an option, but it's not the first line of defense. We'll discuss all the pros and cons once we have the blood work results. I'll also print out some information on healthy eating and stress management techniques for you to review. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week from today… yes, that should be fine. I’ll make a note of it. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and understanding. It’s… it’s nice to finally have a plan. Perhaps a little less “reset” and a little more… direction. I hope the blood work doesn’t reveal anything too alarming. I suppose one can always hope. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. We'll take things one step at a time. I hope everything turns out alright as well. Have a good day. .
