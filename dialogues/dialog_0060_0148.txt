DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um… it’s a bit awkward to discuss, truthfully. It's… pain. Down there. In the… well, in the groin area, I suppose. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. Not a constant thing, but… present. I apologize for the vagueness. It's difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's perfectly alright to be a bit vague, Ms. Stepro. These things are difficult to talk about. "Down there" is perfectly acceptable. So, this pain in the groin area... how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It feels like… several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or two? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Time… it seems to slip away. It wasn’t sharp at first, just a dull ache. It comes and goes, mostly when I'm… well, when I'm working, I believe. With the wood, you know? Lifting and such. But I honestly can't be certain. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, several weeks, coming and going, worse with work… and you do woodworking?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. It’s… well, it's how I earn my living. Small pieces, mostly. Furniture repair, sometimes. It keeps me busy, thankfully. Though, perhaps it’s too busy. I do enjoy it, but maybe I’m pushing myself too hard. Is that… relevant? I often forget if I've overdone it until after the fact.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Stepro. We need to figure out what's causing this pain, and how you're using your body is certainly a factor. So, is the pain on one side, or both?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me concentrate… I believe… it's mostly on the left side. Yes, definitely the left. Though, sometimes it feels… a bit spread out. Not terribly, but… not only on the left, if that makes sense. It’s a… fuzzy sort of pain. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" is fine, Ms. Stepro. We’ll get there. And it’s good you’re trying to recall details. Now, on a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give this pain when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A scale… Hmm… When it's really bad… I suppose… maybe a six? No, perhaps a seven. It’s not debilitating, you understand. I can still work, but it's… distracting. And uncomfortable. Definitely not a ten, thankfully. But not a gentle ache, either. A solid… seven, I think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Now, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not that I can recall. My life is rather… simple, Doctor. Routine, mostly. I eat the same things, sleep the same hours… I don't travel. I see my neighbors occasionally. I… no, nothing has changed, really. Except for the pain, of course. Is there something specific I should be thinking about? I sometimes forget things, you know, and I don't want to leave anything out.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a difficult question. I’ve seen doctors over the years, naturally. For… the usual things. Colds, the flu, a bad back once. But diagnosed? I don’t believe so. Not anything serious. Just… the aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I did have my gallbladder removed many years ago, when I was younger. But other than that… no, I don’t recall any diagnoses. My memory, as I mentioned… it’s not what it used to be. Is that information useful, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… alright. And have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think very carefully. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall. I did have… wisdom teeth removed when I was young, but that hardly seems like surgery, does it? Just… a few extractions. Nothing major. No, no other surgeries, Doctor. I’m quite certain. My mother always said I had a weak constitution, but I’ve managed to avoid… anything serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Medications… Just the basics, Doctor. I take a multivitamin, and sometimes a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, mostly. Over-the-counter. Nothing prescribed regularly. And occasionally, a pain reliever for headaches. But nothing else. Really. I prefer to avoid medications if I can. My grandmother always said they were… unnatural. I apologize for being so… scattered. I'm trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years. Shellfish, nuts… I haven't had any… reactions, as far as I know. A little bit of sneezing sometimes, with pollen, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just… seasonal. No, no allergies, Doctor. Really. I pride myself on having a strong stomach. Though, perhaps that's not so relevant now, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Stepro, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and gently palpate it to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Palpate… that sounds… a bit intrusive, doesn’t it? But if it’s necessary… then please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. My skin is rather sensitive. I apologize for being… a bit of a worrier. It’s just… these things are never pleasant, are they?
DOCTOR: If you could please change into a gown, we’ll get started. It will allow me to examine you more effectively. I'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. A gown. I… suppose I should go change, then. This is… rather embarrassing. I apologize for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. If you could lie back on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is this alright? I hope I’m not… in the way. Please, just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noticing some tenderness in your lower left quadrant, as you described. It’s not severe, but there is definitely some discomfort when I press here. Are you feeling pain right now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's… yes, that’s where it hurts. Not sharp, but… a dull ache. And a little bit of pressure, now. It's… unpleasant. Is that… bad? It feels… different when you touch it. More noticeable, certainly. I apologize for being such a… difficult patient. Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Stepro, but it is something we need to investigate further. There doesn't appear to be any rebound tenderness or guarding, which is good. But given your description of the pain, and the tenderness I'm finding, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a urinalysis. We should also consider imaging, perhaps an ultrasound, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you have any history of kidney stones or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Kidney stones… no, I don't believe so. My mother always said I had a weak bladder, but nothing like… stones. And urinary tract infections… I may have had one or two when I was younger, but nothing recently. Certainly nothing in the past few years. I do remember a little bit of burning sometimes, when I… well, when I go to the bathroom, but I always assumed it was just… age. Is that relevant, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to remember these things. An ultrasound… that sounds… a bit frightening, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not frightening, Ms. Stepro, it’s just a precaution. It uses sound waves, it's non-invasive, and it will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. The burning you’re experiencing could be indicative of a urinary tract infection, which is why I want to run a urinalysis. We need to rule out all possibilities. I’m also going to ask you a few questions about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in your stool recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Bowel movements… That’s… rather personal, isn’t it, Doctor? Well… no, not really. Everything seems… normal, I suppose. The same as always. Nothing unusual. I do have a bit of trouble sometimes, constipation, but that’s nothing new. It comes and goes. I always assumed it was just… my diet. Is that… relevant? I apologize for being so… hesitant. It’s just… these things are never easy to discuss.
DOCTOR: Constipation can sometimes contribute to abdominal discomfort. Alright, Ms. Stepro, let's get those lab orders processed and schedule that ultrasound. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and eating a diet rich in fiber. If you experience any fever, severe pain, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, Doctor. Thank you. The ultrasound… how long will it take to get the results? And… is it possible it could be something serious? I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… I don’t like feeling unwell. And… what if it is serious? What would happen then? I understand if you can’t tell me specifics, but… just a general idea would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. The ultrasound results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. As for whether it could be something serious… it's too early to say. The vast majority of the time, these types of pains are caused by something relatively minor, like muscle strain, constipation, or a mild infection. However, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, like kidney stones, gallbladder issues, or, in rare cases, something more concerning. If it is something more serious, the treatment will depend on the diagnosis. It could range from medication to physical therapy to, in rare cases, surgery. We'll discuss all of your options thoroughly if and when we have a definitive diagnosis. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll get those tests done, review the results, and then come up with a plan. In the meantime, try to relax, drink plenty of fluids, and eat a healthy diet. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s everything. Thank you for your patience. And for… explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your kindness. It’s… comforting to know you’re taking this seriously. I suppose I should… go get changed, then? And schedule the ultrasound? Thank you again, Doctor Nooruddin.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepro. Please, take your time getting changed. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the lab orders and schedule your ultrasound. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take care of you. .
PATIENT: .
