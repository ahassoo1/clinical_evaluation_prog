DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My neighbor, Eunice, she’s been coming here for years, raving about you. Thought I’d see what all the fuss is about. Not that I need anything, you understand. I’ve been a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, a long time. A very long time. I mostly just wanted to… look around, I guess. Is this all new? Everything looks so… shiny.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say, and I’m glad Eunice sent you our way! We did some renovations a few months ago. It’s nice to have a comfortable space for our patients. Even if it’s just a “look around,” I always like to do a quick check-up when someone new comes in. Just to get a baseline, you know?
PATIENT: A baseline? Oh, dear. Is that like… a test? I really don't do well with tests. Always did better assisting with them, not taking them. Honestly, I mostly just keep up with Eunice’s gossip these days. She worries about everything, that one. But a quick look… I suppose that’s alright. As long as it doesn't involve needles. I had a terrible experience with a needle once… back in the 70s, I think it was. Everything’s a blur these days, though.
DOCTOR: No, no big tests, I promise. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, maybe check your blood pressure and a few other basic things. No needles unless absolutely necessary, and we can definitely talk about that if it comes up. It sounds like you’ve had a long career in healthcare yourself! It’s always helpful to know a patient's background. Do you mind if I ask roughly how long you’ve been a surgical tech?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Really long. Let me think… I started right after… well, after my husband passed. That must have been… 1983? Something like that. So… forty-two years? Maybe more. It all blends together, you know? Hospitals all look the same after a while. And all the doctors… faces, names… they all just become a blur. I was very good at it, though. Very precise. Steady hands. Though these days… …they aren’t quite as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Forty-two years – that is a long time! And a very important career, especially with the precision it requires. You must have seen a lot of changes in the field. It’s perfectly normal for things to change with time. Now, just to get a more complete picture, do you have any current health concerns?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Well… my knees ache, of course. Everyone’s knees ache at my age. And my back. Don’t get me started on my back! And sometimes I forget things. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast… things like that. Nothing major. Honestly, I think it’s just old age creeping up on me. Eunice keeps telling me I should get my memory checked, but… what’s the point? It’s not like I’m going to suddenly remember everything, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Aches and pains are common with age, and a little forgetfulness is normal too. We can certainly talk about some ways to manage the pain if you’d like. And while you're right, we can't necessarily "fix" memory, we can rule out anything that might be contributing to it, and there are things that can help. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… The doctor, Dr. Henderson, he told me something years ago. Something about my cholesterol being a little high, I think? He put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn't seem to be doing anything, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. And I think… yes, arthritis. Something in my hands, he said. That explains the stiffness, I suppose. Everything’s always stiff these days. Honestly, I can barely open these jars anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, high cholesterol and arthritis. Thank you for letting me know. And it’s good you told me about stopping the cholesterol medication; we can discuss alternative options if needed. Now, just to get a full picture, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… I take a little something for my water retention, Eunice’s friend gave it to me. Said it was all natural. And a multi-vitamin, every morning. Can't remember the brand, though. It’s in a little orange bottle. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really acting up, I take some of that ibuprofen stuff. The pink pills. Does that count? Honestly, I mostly just take what Eunice tells me to. She reads all those health magazines, knows everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diuretic for water retention, a multi-vitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. It's helpful to know about everything, even the things recommended by friends. It’s good you’re taking something for the arthritis, but we should be careful about long-term use of ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. Except… well, once I had a rash after eating some shrimp. But I always thought that was just bad shrimp. And sometimes my eyes get itchy in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I suppose. Eunice is allergic to cats, terribly allergic, but I love cats. Never bothered me a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible shrimp allergy and seasonal pollen allergies. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must have been… the 80s? And I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago, before I even met my husband. Honestly, it all feels like a lifetime ago. And… oh, I was in the hospital for a week once with the flu. A really bad flu. But that was probably… 20 years ago? Everything just runs together, you know? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, and a past hospitalization for the flu. That's helpful to know. Now, one final set of questions. Do you have any family history of serious illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she died young, from something with her heart, I think. But I wasn’t very close to her. And my father… he lived a long time, but he always smoked. Never seemed to bother him, though. And my brother… he had some kind of cancer, I think. Lung cancer, maybe? But he smoked too. Honestly, we weren’t a very healthy family. We mostly just… ignored things until they got really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and lung cancer. That’s good to know, even if it wasn’t a very healthy family. Thank you for sharing that with me. Alright, Ms. Calvery, that gives me a pretty good overview. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam. Well, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And no needles, remember? I still haven’t forgotten that one. Though I suppose listening to my heart and lungs sounds harmless enough. My knees might creak a bit when I stand up, though. They always do.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. And creaky knees are perfectly normal! Let’s just take things slowly. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: There we go… Oh, goodness. A little stiff, but alright. Reminds me of my old nursing days. All that bending over. You know, I used to be so strong.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing is a bit shallow. And I do notice some swelling and stiffness in your knuckles. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? Oh dear. I knew I shouldn’t have had that extra cookie with my tea this morning. Eunice always tells me I need to watch my salt intake. She's probably right. Shallow breathing, you say? Well, I have been feeling a little tired lately. I just thought it was my age. Everything's slowing down, you know?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily the cookie, Ms. Calvery, though watching your salt is always a good idea. High blood pressure can have a lot of causes, and it’s good we’re checking it. The shallow breathing could be related to a number of things, and the fatigue could be connected. We should run a few tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to have some blood work done and perhaps a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. More tests. Well… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I don’t particularly like needles, you understand, but if it’s for the best… Blood work… that's just a little prick, right? And a chest X-ray… is that safe? I always worry about those things. Eunice’s sister had something to do with radiation, and… well, I don't remember exactly, but it didn't sound good.
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood work is just a small prick. And the chest X-ray involves very minimal radiation exposure—it's a very low dose and the benefits of getting information about your lungs far outweigh the risks. It's a standard procedure and perfectly safe. I understand your concerns, and we can discuss any further questions you have about it. If it helps, I can explain the process and what we’re looking for. We can also start with just the blood work if you prefer. Would that make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Just the blood work… yes, that would be better. One step at a time, you know? I get overwhelmed easily these days. Just the prick… alright. Where would I go for that? And how long will it take? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I wouldn't want to miss that. Eunice would never let me live it down.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, one step at a time is perfectly fine. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take too long—about 15-20 minutes total, including the wait. We’ll get the results back in a few days. I'll have the nurse give you a requisition form and instructions before you go. After we review the results, we can discuss a plan for your blood pressure, fatigue, and arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… manageable. Fifteen minutes… I can handle fifteen minutes. And the nurse will explain everything? Good. I always prefer things in writing. It’s just… my memory, you know. Things tend to… slip my mind. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with an old lady like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. I'll just let the nurse come in and get you set up for the blood work. Is there anything else I can help you with before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… the blood work. And try not to let them use a big needle, okay? Eunice always says I faint at the sight of needles. Though I haven’t fainted in years… I hope. Thank you again, dear. You’ve been a real sweetheart.
DOCTOR: I’ll make a note of your needle phobia. I promise we’ll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery. Nurse Johnson, could you come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright… a good day. I suppose it could be worse. I just hope this doesn't take too long. And I really, really hope that nurse is gentle.
DOCTOR: .
