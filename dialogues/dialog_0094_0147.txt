DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been feeling a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen for a little while now. It's been worrying me, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's certainly worth getting checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… it’s… it’s not painful, usually. Sometimes a little discomfort, like after I’ve been on my feet a lot. I first noticed it maybe a month or two ago, and it hasn't gotten much bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either. It just… is there. It feels…firm, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, no pain normally, just occasional discomfort with activity. You noticed it about a month or two ago, hasn't significantly changed in size, and feels firm to the touch. Good. That gives me a starting point. Now, can you tell me exactly where in your lower abdomen you're feeling this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… lower down, definitely. …Kind of in the middle, maybe a little to the left? Not right in the groin area, but… below my belly button, for sure. It's hard to explain precisely. It's not on the surface, either; you can't see it, you have to feel for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower abdomen, middle to slightly left of your belly button, not visible but palpable. That helps narrow things down. And you mentioned it’s been there for a month or two. Have you noticed any other changes at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. …No fever, no changes in my bathroom habits… no weight loss. My appetite’s been normal. I’ve been a little tired lately, but… I work long hours as a choreographer, so I often feel tired! It’s hard to say if that's related or just the job.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you’ve been observing things carefully. Fatigue can be caused by many things, as you said, and long hours certainly contribute. No fever, no changes in bowel habits, no weight loss – those are all helpful pieces of information. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a child, and I broke my wrist once, but nothing major. No serious illnesses or surgeries. My wife always jokes that I’m annoyingly healthy. I have Medicare, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! So, generally healthy with a history of chickenpox and a broken wrist – nothing ongoing or requiring regular treatment. And thank you for mentioning your Medicare coverage. Have you ever had any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Not ever. I avoid hospitals when I can. My wife had to have her wisdom teeth out a few years ago, and that was stressful enough for both of us. Nothing for me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a little more complicated. My parents both passed away several years ago. My mother… she had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart problems. I don’t know the specifics, really. And I only have one brother, and we haven’t spoken in a long time, so I don’t know anything about his health either. It’s not something we discuss. Sorry, that's probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Amy. You've told me what you know, and that is helpful. A history of high blood pressure and heart problems in your parents is something to keep in mind. Now, to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife sometimes worries because I try everything at festivals, but I’ve been lucky so far. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to stay away from medications if I can. Just lots of coffee to keep me going! I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. Really. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications, vitamins, or supplements. That’s very helpful. Now, Amy, would you be comfortable if I performed a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Please do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what's causing it. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could lie down on the exam table for me, please. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll gently palpate – feel – the area where you're experiencing the lump. I'll be looking for any tenderness or changes in texture. Alright, breathing normally, please. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, does this area feel tender when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just… a little discomfort, like you said, but not pain. It feels…firm, like I mentioned. But mostly just a bit strange. Not sharp or anything. It’s hard to explain. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discomfort, firm texture, no sharp pain. That's helpful. I'm feeling a palpable mass, about… … approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, located just to the left of your midline, as you described. It’s not fixed; it moves slightly when I palpate it. There's no rebound tenderness, which is good, and I don't feel any guarding. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin or abdomen, which is also reassuring. Now, based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the examination, there are a few possibilities. It could be a muscle strain, a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor – or, less commonly, something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests, and possibly an ultrasound of your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Blood tests and an ultrasound… whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’d like to know what’s going on, so I’m happy to do whatever it takes. I’m a little worried, I admit, but I trust your expertise. When would I be able to get those done?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Amy, and it's good you're proactive about getting this checked out. We can get the blood tests done right away. There's a lab just down the hall. I'll give you a requisition form. As for the ultrasound, I'll write a referral for that. You can schedule an appointment with the radiology department at your convenience. They usually have appointments within the next few days. I'll give you the contact information for the radiology department as well. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense, thank you. Blood tests and a referral for an ultrasound… and contact the clinic if anything changes. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
