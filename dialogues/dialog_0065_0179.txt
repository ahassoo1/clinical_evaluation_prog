DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. Um, well, it is the words. They… they don't come so easy now. It is very strange. I try to say something, and it feels like… like they are stuck. Not all the time, but often enough to be… concerning.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” you say. Concerning is a good way to put it. Alright. To clarify, you're experiencing difficulty finding the right words when you speak?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… a good way to describe it. Finding the words. It is not that I… I do not know what I want to say, it is just… they are not there when I need them. Like a… a memory, almost, but not quite. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, I can imagine. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a difficult question. It has been… some time. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It started very slowly, I think. I would miss a word here or there, and… I thought it was just my age. But it is getting… more frequent. I cannot say exactly when it started, I am afraid. My memory… is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Six months, approximately. And would you describe this difficulty as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. Not always. Some days are… better. Other days, it is… very difficult. It seems worse when I am… tired, perhaps. Or if I am trying to explain something complicated. Simple things, like saying “good morning,” are usually fine. But… a longer sentence? That is when the trouble begins.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been impacting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It has. I… I used to enjoy talking to people. Sharing stories. Now… I hesitate. I worry I will not find the right words. It is… embarrassing, sometimes. I also… I used to help my wife with… with paperwork. Numbers and things. That is becoming difficult too, because I need to… describe things to her. And now… well, she is gone. And it makes it… harder.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that this is adding to the stress. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with finding words?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Um… let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little… unsteady. Not falling, exactly, but… like I might. And… my wife used to say I was mumbling. Before… before she passed. I did not pay much attention, but… perhaps it is connected? I also… sleep is not always easy. But I think that is just… age.
DOCTOR: Unsteadiness, possible mumbling, and difficulty sleeping. Okay. Any history of headaches, vision changes, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. A little ache sometimes, but nothing serious. Vision… I wear glasses, as you can see. It has not changed much recently. And weakness… no, I don’t think so. I can still walk and… and do most things. Maybe a little slower than before, but… no weakness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor put me on medicine, and it seemed to help. I stopped taking it a few years back, the doctor said it was okay. And… my wife, she took care of most of the details. I am not very good with remembering… medical things. Medicare takes care of everything, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… yes. I had my appendix out when I was young. And… a knee replacement, about ten years ago. That was… successful. No hospitalizations… not really. Just… for the knee surgery, of course. And… a few overnight stays when my wife was sick. I stayed with her.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… my mother… she had… something with her memory, when she got older. Not like me, exactly, but… forgetting things. My father… he was healthy, mostly. A strong man. He did not have any… problems like this. It is… difficult to remember, Doctor. My wife… she kept track of these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you can't recall everything. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. I used to… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not anymore. And… no. No drugs. Never. My wife… she did not approve.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I take a… a vitamin D tablet, sometimes. The doctor said I was low. And… that is all, I think. Just the vitamin D. And… sometimes, if my knee is sore, I take a painkiller. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your reflexes, balance, and a few simple cognitive tests. This won’t be painful, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… acceptable. If it will help. I want to… understand what is happening. I just… I hope it is not something serious. I am… a little nervous, to be honest. But… yes. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things slowly. First, let’s just check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll move on to the neurological exam. Please, have a seat on the examination table. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Within normal limits, though the blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm, please. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh… this is… difficult. I feel a little unsteady. . I… I don’t think I can hold it for very long. It feels like I might fall.
DOCTOR: Easy now, Mr. Gyamfi, that’s alright. Please, open your eyes and sit down. That’s a bit more than I was expecting. Some mild unsteadiness with eyes closed. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. I… I think I remember them. It… it took a little effort.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… um… It is… 20… 2025, yes. August the second. I… I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you spell the word “World” backwards?
PATIENT: … D-L-R-O-W? Is that… correct? It is… difficult to think backwards. My wife was always better at these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Thank you for your patience with the examination. Based on your history and the physical and neurological exam, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Your symptoms – difficulty with word finding, occasional unsteadiness, and some challenges with recall and cognitive tasks – could be indicative of several things, including early cognitive decline, a possible transient ischemic attack , or a medication interaction. Given your age and the constellation of symptoms, and the fact that you recently stopped taking blood pressure medication, I’m concerned about possible vascular contributions to your cognitive difficulties. While it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Brain… MRI? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Are you saying… something is wrong? I… I don’t want to worry my wife. She has been through so much already. The tests… yes, if you think they are necessary. But… please, Doctor, be gentle. And… tell me, honestly, what you think is happening. I would rather know, even if it is… bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gyamfi. The MRI is a precautionary measure. It allows us to visualize your brain and rule out any underlying structural issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. It does not automatically mean something is seriously wrong. Regarding your symptoms, it’s too early to say definitively what's happening. However, it is important to investigate them thoroughly. Your history of high blood pressure is a concern, as uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of small strokes or vascular changes in the brain, which can affect cognitive function. I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive cognitive evaluation. They are specialists in diagnosing and managing cognitive disorders. It's important to get their expert opinion. I will order the blood tests right away. We’ll schedule the MRI and neurology appointment as soon as possible. We’ll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. I want to reassure you that we are taking your concerns seriously and we will work together to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to address them. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes. That… that sounds good, Doctor. I… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. The tests… and the neurologist. Yes, I will do whatever you think is best. I just… I want to feel like myself again. And… I want to be able to remember things. For my wife. And… for myself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Gyamfi. We will do everything we can. I will have my nurse draw the blood tests now. She will also schedule you for the MRI and neurology appointment. I will call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes. And, if you experience any sudden weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now, Doctor. You have answered everything. Thank you. And… thank you for being so kind. I… I suppose I will see you again soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. Please take your time getting up. Yes, we will see each other again soon. My nurse will escort you to the lab. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
