DOCTOR: Hi Odell, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh... hi. Yeah. I... need something for travel. My wife... she would always handle this. Now... I just... gotta go. Somewhere. For work. It's... hot there. Really hot. I think. I don't really remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. That’s alright, take your time. It sounds like you're needing some advice or preventative measures for a trip to a warm climate. You mentioned your wife usually handles this – is this a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent... yeah. Very recent. She... passed. Last month. It's... hard. Everything is hard. I just... need to go. The job... they need me. I don't want to cause trouble. So... what do I need? To not get sick. Like she always made sure of.
DOCTOR: I’m so very sorry for your loss, Odell. It’s completely understandable that everything feels difficult right now. Please don’t worry about causing trouble; we're here to help you stay healthy, and we’ll take things at your pace. It's good you're thinking about staying well for your trip. Knowing where you’re going would be helpful. Do you know what part of the world you’ll be traveling to?
PATIENT: Uh... somewhere in... Africa, I think. The company said... Nigeria. Yeah, Nigeria. Lots of... oil stuff. I just put things together. They told me what to pack, but... nothing about... sickness. Just... work clothes. And... bug spray. Is that enough? She always got... shots, and pills. Is that what I need?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nigeria. That’s helpful. And yes, you’re right to think about preventative measures beyond bug spray – it’s good you’re remembering your wife’s precautions. Nigeria does have some specific health considerations we need to address. Let’s start with a bit more information. Have you travelled internationally before, Odell?
PATIENT: Uh... not really. Just... India, once. A long time ago. With her. That was... different. She did everything. Booked the doctor, the flights... everything. I just... followed her. I don't... I don't know anything about... travel stuff. It's all confusing. She always said to drink bottled water. And... not eat the street food. Is that still right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some international travel experience, but not recent, and you relied on your wife for the arrangements. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll get you sorted. Bottled water and avoiding street food are excellent starting points. To get a clearer picture of what we need to do, let's talk about your general health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh... no. Not that I know of. I... I haven't been to a doctor in... years. She always took care of that too. I feel okay. Mostly. Just... tired. And... sad. But that's... normal, right? I work hard. Lifting things. Building things. Nothing really hurts. I take some... pain pills sometimes. For my back. But not often. Just when it's really bad. They're... the blue ones. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, but haven’t been to a doctor recently. It’s common to feel tired and sad after a loss, Odell, and that’s perfectly understandable. And it’s good you're telling me about the pain pills – even occasional use is important to know. Do you remember the name of those blue pain pills, or roughly how often you take them?
PATIENT: Uh... no. I don't remember the name. Just... blue. Small ones. And... I only take them when my back really hurts. Maybe... once a month? Sometimes not even that. If I lift something wrong. Or... sleep funny. She... she always got them for me. I just... take one or two. To get through the day. I don’t really pay attention to the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, small blue pain pills, used occasionally for back pain. We’ll need to figure out exactly what those are later, just to be safe. It’s good you’re being honest about that, Odell. Now, let's quickly go through some other things. Do you have any allergies – to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh... no. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I mean, I used to. Now... I don't really have much appetite. But I haven't... reacted to anything. She... she always asked me that too. I would say no. And I always did. I think. Everything is... blurry now. I just... want to go. And come back. And... get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It’s alright that things feel blurry, Odell. We'll take this slowly. To help me get a better understanding of what we need to do for your trip, could you tell me a little bit about the work you’ll be doing in Nigeria?
PATIENT: Uh… building things. For the oil company. They’re building a new… platform. I put things together. Metal things. Big metal things. It’s hot work. Outside. All day. The company said… safety training. And… wear a hard hat. And… don't talk to strangers. Mostly… just building. She… she would ask about the safety things too. Make sure everything was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, building a platform for the oil company, hot outdoor work. Safety training and hard hat, good. To make sure we cover everything, let’s quickly go through a few more questions. Do you have any history of serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Uh... no. Nothing serious. I broke my arm once. When I was a kid. Climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. She... she always asked about surgeries. I would say no. I never had any. Just... the arm. That's it. She... she made sure I went to the doctor when I was little. She... she was always so careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Finally, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of serious medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he had… problems with his heart. A long time ago. He passed away when I was young. My mother… she was okay. Mostly. She had… high blood pressure, I think. But that was… old age. Nothing serious. She… she always went to the doctor. She… she would know more. But… she's gone now. Everything is… gone now. I just… want to go to work. And… come home. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems and high blood pressure. Thank you for sharing that, Odell. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot recently, and I really appreciate you coming in and telling me everything. We will get you prepared for this trip. Knowing your wife was so diligent about your health gives us a good starting point. Based on what you've told me, and the fact you’re travelling to Nigeria for work, we need to consider a few things. We'll want to get you up-to-date on recommended vaccinations, discuss malaria prevention, and make sure you have a plan for managing potential health concerns while you're there. First, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline reading. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Uh... okay. Yeah. That's fine. Whatever you think. Just... get it over with. Vaccinations... malaria... I don't even know what that is. She... she always handled it. Just... do what you need to do. I'll... I'll sit here. Whatever you say. Just... be quick, okay? It's... hard to talk about all this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. We’ll take it as quickly and comfortably as possible. I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I’m going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Okay, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Blood pressure is 130 over 80 – a little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears and throat appear normal. Everything sounds good so far, Odell. Now, can you tell me a little about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Uh… just the blue pain pills. Sometimes. When my back hurts. Like I said. Small ones. I don't know the name. She… she got them for me. At the pharmacy. Just… when I need them. I don't take them every day. Maybe once a month. Or… less. I don’t really keep track. I just… take one or two. And… that's it. I don't take anything else. I swear.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blue pain pills occasionally for back pain. We really need to identify those pills, Odell. It’s important to know what you’re taking, even if it’s infrequent. Do you happen to remember what the pharmacy was called?
PATIENT: Uh... no. I don't remember. She always went. She... she knew everything. The name of the pharmacy... the name of the doctor... everything. I just... followed her. It was… near our house. A small one. With a… green sign, I think. But… I don’t know the name. Honestly. I just... don't remember. I'm sorry. Everything is... a blur. Can we… just get this over with? I need to… go to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It’s alright. We’ll figure it out. It’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. We can try to get the information from your insurance records later. Since you don’t recall the name of the pain pills, we’ll need to be cautious. Given the trip to Nigeria and the possibility of malaria exposure, I want to be extra thorough. I’m going to order some blood work. It will check your overall health, look for any underlying conditions, and rule out anything that might contraindicate certain medications. It will also help us establish a baseline in case you need medical attention while you're abroad. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uh… blood work? Yeah. Okay. Whatever you need. Just… be quick. I hate needles. She… she always held my hand. But… she’s not here. Just… get it over with. Can I… sit down? I’m starting to feel… dizzy. This is… a lot. I just… want to go home. Can we… just finish this?
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. Please, sit down. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about needles and overwhelmed with everything. I’ll be as quick as possible. And I’ll make sure someone stays with you to keep you comfortable. The blood work will be relatively quick, just a few vials. I'll also need to get a urine sample. Do you have any issues with providing that?
PATIENT: Uh... no. I can do that. I guess. Just... where do I go? Is there a… bathroom? I just… want to get this over with. This is… hard. She… she always made it easy. But… I just… want to go home. Can I… just sit here for a minute? I feel… weak. This is… too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. Take all the time you need. There’s a bathroom just down the hall, and I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and help you when you're ready. Don't rush. We can also discuss the vaccinations you'll need for Nigeria while you're gathering the sample. And I'll give you some information on malaria prevention – the importance of mosquito repellent, protective clothing, and potential medications. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uh... yeah. Okay. Vaccinations... malaria... Just... tell me what to do. I just... want to be safe. I don't want to get sick. She... she always knew what to do. Just... tell me what to do. And I'll do it. I promise. Just... be quick. And... try to be gentle, okay? This is... hard. Really hard. Can we… just get this over with? I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. We will get through this together. I understand this is difficult, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. Sarah will be in shortly to help you with the urine sample. Then, we can discuss the necessary vaccinations. For Nigeria, you'll need Yellow Fever vaccination, and I recommend Typhoid and Hepatitis A vaccinations as well. We can also talk about malaria prophylaxis - medication to prevent malaria. There are several options, and we’ll choose the one that’s best for you. And don't worry, I’ll explain everything in detail. We’ll make sure you feel confident and prepared before you go. Is there anyone you would like me to contact for you at this point?
PATIENT: Uh… no. No one. Everyone is… gone. Just… get it over with. Just… do what you need to do. I just… want to go home. And… go to work. That’s all. Just… don’t make me talk anymore, okay? Just… do the tests. And tell me what to take. And… then I can go, right? Can I… just sit here until you're ready? Please? This is… too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. You don’t need to say another word. Just sit here and relax. I'll let Sarah know you're ready, and she’ll be in shortly. You’ve been incredibly brave today, sharing everything with me. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable and prepared before you leave. Just focus on breathing, and remember, you’re not alone. We’ll get through this together. Sarah?
