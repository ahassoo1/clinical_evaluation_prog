DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Odell. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, travel. I need… something for travel. My wife, she always took care of this. Before… I don’t really know what I need, to be honest. She did all the papers and the… the shots.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a little overwhelming when you're not used to handling these things. “Travel” can mean a lot of different things medically. Are you planning a trip internationally, or domestically?
PATIENT: International. Yeah, to… Nepal. Visiting family. It’s… been a long time. It’s… hot there, right? Is that… something I need a shot for?
DOCTOR: Nepal, okay. Yes, it can get quite hot, depending on the region and time of year. And yes, there are several vaccines and precautions we should discuss for travel to Nepal. Before we get into specifics, have you had any vaccinations recently, or do you have a record of any previous immunizations?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not really. Like I said, my wife… she did everything. I think… maybe when I was a kid? But I don't remember. There were papers… somewhere. I don’t know where they are now. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem. We can certainly work with that. It's always best to be up-to-date, even if we need to repeat some things. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions—like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. I… I work. I build things on airplanes. It’s… pretty physical. I’m healthy. Mostly. Just… tired, sometimes. But everyone is, right? No problems. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm once, when I was little, falling from a tree. But that’s it. Just a cast. Nothing serious. So, what do I need for Nepal? Is it… dangerous?
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries, that’s good to know. Nepal is a beautiful country, but there are a few things we need to consider to make sure you stay healthy while you’re there. Before we get into specific vaccinations, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… I don't think so. I eat everything. My wife… she made sure I didn't eat anything bad. Maybe dust? Sometimes I sneeze a lot when it’s dusty at work. Is that an allergy? It doesn’t bother me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medication or food allergies, and a possible sensitivity to dust. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I just… work. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I take a painkiller if my back hurts from work, but that’s it. Just… the regular stuff you can buy at the store. Is this going to take long? I need to get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to get back to work, Odell. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more quick questions. Have you had any recent illnesses—like a cold, the flu, or anything else—in the past few months?
PATIENT: Uh… I think I had a little cough, maybe in the spring? It didn't last long. Just… a normal cough. Everyone gets coughs, right? I didn’t go to the doctor or anything. Just… drank tea and rested. I don't get sick much. My wife… she always made sure I was healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you’ve been generally healthy. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with. I got things to do. Is Nepal… safe? I heard things on the news, you know? About… earthquakes.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Ears look clear, throat looks normal. Overall, you appear to be in good physical condition. Regarding Nepal, you are right to be aware of the potential for earthquakes. It's a seismic zone. We'll discuss precautions you can take. Given your travel plans and medical history, I recommend the following vaccinations: Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a Tetanus booster. We should also discuss Malaria prophylaxis. Do you have any questions about those?
PATIENT: Malaria? What’s… Malaria? Is that… bad? I don’t even know what those words mean. And… how much is this going to cost? My wife… she handled all the money stuff too.
DOCTOR: Malaria is a serious infection transmitted by mosquitoes. It’s prevalent in some parts of Nepal. We’ll discuss medication to prevent it. Let’s start with the vaccinations. Hepatitis A is a liver infection, Typhoid is a bacterial infection you can get through contaminated food and water. Both are common in areas with less developed sanitation. We can administer those here today. As for cost, let me check with insurance to give you an estimate. One moment. The good news is, your insurance does cover these vaccinations with a copay of $75 per shot. The Malaria medication will be about $150 for a month's supply. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: $225? That’s… a lot of money. I don’t… I don’t know if I have that much right now. And… mosquitoes? Can’t I just… wear long sleeves? My wife… she always said long sleeves would protect me. This is… complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Odell. It is a bit of an expense. While long sleeves can help, mosquitoes are quite resourceful and can bite through clothing. And unfortunately, they can carry diseases that can be very serious. We could discuss starting with just the Hepatitis A vaccine today, and then come back for the others when you're able. That's $75. It will give you some protection. Would that be more manageable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… the one shot, then. The… Hepatitis A. $75. Just get it over with. I just want to go see my family. That’s all. My wife… she would want me to go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Odell. That’s the most important thing. We’ll get you started with the Hepatitis A vaccine today. It’s a simple injection, and it will provide good initial protection. Alright, that's done. A little soreness at the injection site is normal. I'll give you a card with information about potential side effects. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the remaining vaccinations and Malaria prevention when you're ready. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I just… I need to go.
