DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 74 years old. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Yes, 74, that is correct. I am here… well, to try and stop smoking. It’s been a habit for a very long time, and I’ve decided it’s time, finally, to see if something can be done about it. Perhaps you can assist me?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It’s… commendable that you’ve decided to address this now. Many patients find it difficult to even consider quitting. Let’s get some details. How many years have you been smoking, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a very long time. I started when I was… sixteen, I believe. So, that would be… fifty-eight years. Fifty-eight years this November, if you can believe it. A lifetime, really. Mostly cigarettes, though I did try pipes for a spell. Didn’t care for them much.
DOCTOR: Fifty-eight years is… a significant duration. And how many cigarettes would you typically smoke in a day, on average?
PATIENT: That varies, Doctor, it does. When I was working, perhaps two packs a day. Now that I am retired… closer to one and a half, maybe. Though if I’m feeling… unsettled, or bored, it can be closer to two again. It’s a difficult habit to regulate, you see. I don’t smoke first thing in the morning, but then it’s fairly constant throughout the day.
DOCTOR: Constant throughout the day. Alright. Have you attempted to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, a few times. Not successfully, I must admit. I tried those… patches, I believe they were called. Didn’t care for them, made me feel quite unwell. And my nephew, he suggested some gum once. That didn't help either, just made my jaw ache. I’ve mostly tried… willpower, but after fifty-eight years, it’s proving… insufficient.
DOCTOR: Willpower alone is rarely sufficient, especially after such a prolonged period. And the patches and gum… they don’t work for everyone. Do you have any other medical conditions, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Let me see… my knees, they bother me some days. Arthritis, the doctor said. And my blood pressure, it runs a little high, but I don’t take any medication for it. Nothing else that I am aware of, no. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite some time, to be honest. Just the knees when they flare up.
DOCTOR: It’s important to maintain regular check-ups, Mr. Knoch, even if you feel well. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I know of. I haven’t had much need for medication, thankfully. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, but nothing regular. I recall being given penicillin as a child, but that was… well, a very long time ago, and I had no ill effects. A simple man, I am, with few ailments.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just a bit of chamomile tea before bed sometimes, if I’m having trouble sleeping. But that’s not a medication, is it? Just… a warm drink. I prefer to avoid pills and potions whenever possible, if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Knoch, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline, you understand. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. I understand the need for such things. Please, proceed. I am a patient man, and I will cooperate fully. Though I must warn you, my knees may creak a bit when I stand.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, as expected. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are somewhat diminished, and I detect a slight irregularity in your heart rhythm. It’s not alarming, but it requires further attention. Throat appears clear. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that sufficient? I do have a bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but I assumed it was just… dust. I keep my house fairly clean, but one can never be certain, can one? The air in this city isn’t always the best, either. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Your breathing is somewhat labored, Mr. Knoch, and the diminished sounds are concerning given your smoking history. The irregularity in your heart rhythm is also something we need to investigate further. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram – an EKG – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’ll also need a blood test to check your overall health and lung function. We need to rule out any serious underlying conditions before we can formulate a plan to help you quit smoking. It’s not simply a matter of willpower, Mr. Knoch, and delaying proper evaluation could be detrimental.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… serious, Doctor. X-rays and blood tests… I haven’t had those done in… decades, I suspect. Is it something to be very worried about? I do feel a little breathless sometimes, especially walking uphill, but I attributed that to my age and the knees. I must admit, I hadn’t considered… something more serious. I suppose I should have come sooner. What sort of conditions are you looking for, if you don’t mind me asking?
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, smoking significantly increases your risk of developing lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – COPD – and cardiovascular disease. The X-ray will help us identify any abnormalities in your lungs, such as tumors or fluid buildup. The EKG will assess the electrical activity of your heart and detect any arrhythmias or signs of heart damage. The blood test will provide information about your overall health, including your oxygen levels and any signs of inflammation. While I don't want to alarm you unnecessarily, it's crucial to be proactive. Early detection is key to successful treatment. I’ll have the nurse draw blood now, and we’ll schedule the X-ray and EKG as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? No, I don't believe so. I've never had any dyes injected before, as far as I recall. I've mostly avoided medical procedures, to be honest. I always hoped… it wouldn’t come to this. So, the X-ray involves a dye? Will it be uncomfortable? And… what if something is found? I suppose I should prepare myself for the worst, shouldn’t I? This is all rather… overwhelming, Doctor. I just wanted to stop smoking, not… uncover a host of ailments.
DOCTOR: The X-ray may require contrast dye, depending on the initial findings. It's not always necessary, but we need to be prepared. It can cause a slight warming sensation, but is generally well-tolerated. As for "what if something is found," Mr. Knoch, we will address any concerns as they arise. We will discuss all options and develop a treatment plan together. However, I must stress that delaying diagnosis and treatment will only worsen any potential issues. I understand your anxiety, but it’s crucial to remain calm and focus on taking proactive steps to improve your health. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. She can also provide you with a requisition form for the X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t suppose I do. Just… a little overwhelmed, as you say. Blood tests, X-rays, EKGs… it’s a lot to take in. I suppose I should be grateful for the thoroughness, Doctor. And you’re right, delaying things wouldn’t be wise. Very well. Please, send the nurse when you’re ready. I’ll try to remain calm, as you suggested. It’s just… after fifty-eight years of smoking, it’s hard to imagine my lungs functioning properly at all. But I suppose we’ll see, won’t we? Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll inform the nurse you’re ready. In the meantime, try to relax. We'll take things one step at a time. .
PATIENT: .
