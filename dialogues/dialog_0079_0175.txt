DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 65 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 65, getting up there, huh? Well, it's this pain... it's been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: “A little while.” Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little ache here and there. But it's gotten worse lately, you know? It's pretty consistent now.
DOCTOR: Consistent. And where exactly is this pain, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my lower back. Right here, on the left side. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but mostly it stays in my back.
DOCTOR: I see. And would you describe this pain as sharp, dull, burning… or something else entirely?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. But when I move a certain way, or try to stand up straight, it gets sharp for a second. Then it goes back to being a dull ache. It’s hard to explain, really. Not a constant, stabbing pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable. And does anything relieve this pain, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Well, when I lie down, it gets a little better. And if I take it really easy, don’t do too much… that helps. But, you know, I still gotta live my life. I can't just lie in bed all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you tried any over-the-counter medications for this pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve been taking some ibuprofen. The orange pills. It helps a little, takes the edge off, but it doesn’t really fix it. And I don’t like taking too many, you know? My stomach doesn't always agree with them.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. And how many milligrams are you taking, and how frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Now you're asking technical questions. Let me see... the bottle says 200 milligrams? And I usually take two of them when it's really bothering me. Maybe three times a day, if it’s a bad day. I'm not really good at keeping track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Two hundred milligrams, two to three times daily. Alright. Now, Mr. Way, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a better overall picture. Have you had any recent injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I can think of. I didn’t fall or lift anything heavy or anything like that. It just… started. That’s why I'm a little worried, you know? I haven't done anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, my left foot has been a little… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, just here and there. It's not bad enough to really bother me, but I've noticed it a few times, especially when I've been on my feet for a long time.
DOCTOR: Tingly sensation in left foot… intermittent. Alright. And how about bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Bowel or bladder… oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Everything seems pretty normal there, Doctor. No problems with that, thankfully. I hope that's not too personal of a question.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Way. Standard procedure. Now, do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Other than that, not much. Nothing major. I also had a bad case of the flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, right?
DOCTOR: Hypertension, controlled. Appendectomy. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, the blood pressure pills, like I said. And… that’s it, I think. Oh, sometimes I take something for allergies, but only during the spring, when the pollen is bad. It's just a little over-the-counter stuff, a red pill.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Way, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you don’t mind. We'll start with your back.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Let me know if I need to do anything special. Just point me in the right direction.
DOCTOR: If you could lie face down for me, please. We'll begin with palpation of your lower back. Try to relax as much as possible, and let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I'll try my best to relax. It's just... sometimes hard to keep still when something hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Tell me if you feel any sharp pain or discomfort. Hmm… tenderness present over the L4-L5 vertebral level, left paraspinal muscles. No palpable muscle spasm noted at this time. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's gonna be tough. Oh… that's a bit painful, Doctor. I can't quite reach my toes, and it feels tight in my lower back. That's not a very good sign, huh?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with forward flexion. Pain reported with movement. Now, let’s try extending your back.
PATIENT: Okay, trying that now… That's… also painful, but not as bad as bending forward. It feels like something's blocking me, you know? Like it’s hard to get a full stretch. This is all making me a little nervous, Doctor. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with extension as well. Reports discomfort. We'll need to assess your reflexes and strength next. Please roll over onto your back. I'll be testing your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Okay, rolling over now. Just let me know what you need me to do, Doctor. I'm a little worried about this, to be honest. Is it a pinched nerve, maybe? My sister had a bad one once…
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes 1+ bilaterally, slightly diminished on the left. Straight leg raise negative bilaterally. No radicular pain elicited. Plantar flexion and dorsiflexion 5/5 bilaterally. Your reflexes are slightly diminished on the left, and there is some weakness in your dorsiflexion. This, combined with your limited range of motion and reported pain, suggests a possible… muscular strain or early nerve compression, although further investigation is required to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Nerve compression… that doesn’t sound good, Doctor. So, what does that mean? Do I need… an X-ray? Or maybe an MRI? My sister had an MRI for her nerve, and it looked scary. Is it something I did? I haven’t been lifting anything heavy lately, I promise. I mostly just garden and walk my dog…
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Way. An MRI is not necessarily required at this stage. However, to rule out any structural abnormalities, I’m going to order some blood work to assess for inflammation and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And yes, we will obtain lumbar X-rays to visualize your spine and assess for any obvious fractures or bone spurs. As for your question about what you did… it’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of lower back pain. It could be a simple muscular strain from everyday activities, or it could be related to age-related changes in your spine. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I will also prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help alleviate your pain and reduce inflammation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… alright. I just want to get back to my garden, you know? And walking Buster, my dog. He misses me when I can’t take him for long walks. So, when will I get the blood work and X-rays done? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm hoping it won’t be too long. I don’t want to be stuck inside all summer.
DOCTOR: I've just written you a lab order for complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they can take the X-rays right away. It typically takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activities, and be sure to follow the instructions on the medication bottles. If your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for seeing me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I'll go get the blood work and X-rays done right away. And I'll be careful, I promise. Hopefully, it’s just a little muscle strain, like you said. I'm just glad I came in to get it checked out. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Way. Please let the receptionist know when you’ve completed the tests. Have a good day. .
