DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Soodeen, is it? Fancy name. Well, I suppose it’s about… these feet. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. They’ve gotten me this far, haven't they? Though, my daughter insisted I come. Said I was being “stubborn.” Honestly, the youth these days…
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Soodeen is correct. And it’s good of you to come in, Ms. Gunasekara, even if it was at your daughter’s insistence. It's always wise to have things checked out. So, these feet… can you tell me more about what’s been bothering you with them?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Nothing’s bothering me. It's just… they want me to have… procedures. Some kind of cutting and poking, I think my daughter said. And honestly, at my age? What’s the point? I've lived a long life, seen a lot. I don't need anyone messing with perfectly good feet. Though they are a little… swollen, I suppose. But that’s just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about procedures, especially at any age. And you’re right, some swelling can be a normal part of aging. However, swelling can also indicate other issues that are worth investigating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice? That’s a difficult question. Everything seems to blend together after a while, you know? Probably… a few months ago, maybe? It came on gradually. I honestly didn't pay much attention at first. I just figured it was the heat, or maybe I was walking too much. I do like to garden, you know. But really, it hasn’t been that bothersome. Not enough to warrant all this fuss.
DOCTOR: A few months ago, gradually worsening… and associated with walking and gardening. Okay. Has the swelling been getting worse recently, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… hard to say. Maybe a little worse? I don't really look at my feet all that often, dear. I have better things to do, you know? Like watching my stories. Though I did notice yesterday when I was trying on my sandals… they felt a bit snug. Which is odd, because they always fit just fine before. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Just my imagination.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s good you mentioned the sandals feeling snug – that’s a helpful detail. Ms. Gunasekara, I see here in your chart you’ve been diagnosed with hypertension in the past. Is that currently well-controlled?
PATIENT: Hypertension? Oh, that old thing. Yes, well, mostly. I take my pills, when I remember. My daughter keeps after me about it, of course. She's very organized, that one. Sometimes I forget if I've taken them or not. It's not like I’m feeling any different, you know? Honestly, all these doctors and pills… it's just too much to keep track of. It’s probably all connected, isn’t it? The feet, the blood pressure… everything just falling apart.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with managing multiple health concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. And you’re right to consider if there might be a connection between your blood pressure and the swelling in your feet. High blood pressure can sometimes contribute to swelling in the lower extremities. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your feet, your ankles, and take your blood pressure, just to get some baseline measurements. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you have to. But don't go poking around too much. And please, no needles. I hate needles. I suppose a quick look won’t hurt. But I expect you to be gentle. And fast. I have my stories to get back to, you know. Don't keep me waiting too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. No needles, I promise. And I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Your pulses are good, and I didn't detect any unusual sounds in your ankles. However, I do notice some swelling in both of your feet and ankles, as you mentioned. And your blood pressure is a little elevated at 150 over 90. Do you usually check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. Well, I used to have one of those machines… my daughter bought it for me, you know. But it was so complicated! All those numbers and buttons. I just couldn’t get the hang of it. It ended up in the closet somewhere. I don’t bother with it anymore. Honestly, it just made me anxious. And as for checking… no, I don’t. I leave that to the doctors, which clearly isn’t working out very well. Is it bad? Don’t tell me it’s bad. I just want to watch my stories in peace.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Ms. Gunasekara, but it is higher than we’d like it to be. And, given the swelling in your feet, it’s something we need to address. The swelling could be related to a few things – your blood pressure, fluid retention, or even just prolonged standing or walking. To help me narrow down the cause, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests. These will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, honestly. More poking and prodding? Is this really necessary? I mean, I feel fine. A little swollen, yes, but perfectly capable. My daughter is going to be thrilled. She always wants me to have every test imaginable. Is it going to be a lot of blood? I get faint easily, you know. And honestly, the whole process is just so… undignified. What exactly will these tests tell you that you don't already know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara. And I assure you, it won’t be a lot of blood – just a few small tubes. The tests will give us a clearer picture of how your kidneys are functioning, which can affect fluid balance and blood pressure. It will also help us rule out other possible causes for the swelling, just to be thorough. Think of it as gathering information, so we can best manage your health and get you back to enjoying your stories in peace. If you’d prefer, we can start with just a basic kidney function test. That will give us a good starting point. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A basic one. That sounds… less dreadful. Just one test, you promise? No surprises? And please, tell the person drawing the blood to be gentle. I really don't like needles. And make sure they use a small one. A very small one. Honestly, all this fuss over a little swelling… it’s just ridiculous. But if it will get my daughter off my back… fine. Do it. But quickly, please. I have my stories to get back to.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the basic kidney function test to start. I'll make a note to the lab technician to be as gentle as possible and use a small needle. I'll also write down clear instructions on your chart regarding your aversion to needles. While we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your feet whenever possible, and limiting your salt intake. That can help reduce some of the swelling. And it would be beneficial to check your blood pressure regularly, even if it’s just at the doctor’s office. I'll have the lab draw the blood now. Then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Elevate my feet… and less salt? Honestly, it sounds like a lot of work. But alright, I’ll try. Though I do enjoy a good salted pretzel now and then. And checking my blood pressure… I suppose I can ask the nurse when I come for my stories. Yes, a follow-up appointment sounds… necessary. But quickly, please. I don't want to spend all day in a doctor's office. Now, let’s get this over with so I can get back to my stories. And please, remind the person drawing the blood to be gentle. I mean it. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I've already made a note to the lab about your preference for a gentle draw. And I’ll schedule your follow-up appointment for as soon as the results are available. It should only be a few days. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let her know if you’re feeling anxious at any point. Is there anything else I can assist you with before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… please, tell the nurse again to be gentle. And to hurry. I really need to get back to my stories. They’re at a very exciting part, you know. Honestly, all this fuss over a little swelling… it’s just ridiculous. But if it will get everyone off my back… fine. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Gunasekara. I'll personally let the nurse know to be as gentle and efficient as possible. I’ll step out now so you have some privacy. Please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
PATIENT: .
