DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, you say? Hmm. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Need a doctor, you know? Medicare said I should come. Something about a check-up, maybe? It’s all a bit… blurry. I do makeup, for the theater. Very important work, really. Not like… painting faces for children. This is art.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It's common to feel a little overwhelmed with new things. A general check-up is a great place to start when establishing care with a new doctor, especially with Medicare. And that's wonderful about your work – theater makeup sounds fascinating! To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit more about why you were advised to come in for this check-up?
PATIENT: Advised? Hmm. The lady on the phone, mostly. Said something about… being new. And old. Not old old, but… you know. A certain age. She asked about… problems. I don’t really have problems. Just… tired sometimes. It's the lights, I think. Very bright lights for the stage. Make a man weary. Is this… a test? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t a test, Mr. Szmyd, and we’ll certainly take things at your pace. We can absolutely avoid needles if possible, at least for now. It’s good you mentioned the tiredness. It could be related to the bright lights, but let’s explore a bit further to be sure. When you say tired, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe…? Like… heavy. Everything feels heavy. My legs, mostly. And… I lose focus. During the show, sometimes I forget what comes next. Not a good look for the lead makeup artist, eh? People expect… perfection. It’s a demanding job. Very demanding. And my wife… well, my ex-wife… she always said I was… distracted. Before she left, that is. A long story. Not important now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heavy legs and difficulty focusing – those are helpful details. It’s good you’re able to tell me this. Losing focus during a performance must be concerning. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on. To get a better sense of things, have you noticed this tiredness or difficulty focusing getting worse over time, or has it been fairly constant?
PATIENT: Constant, I think. Always been a bit… scattered, to be honest. But maybe worse lately. The shows are bigger now. More complicated makeup. More pressure. And… less sleep. I worry about the details. The shading, the highlights… Everything has to be just so. It's exhausting, really. Not that anyone understands. They just see the finished face. They don’t see the hours… the worry… the tiny brushes.
DOCTOR: I can appreciate that, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you put a great deal of care and precision into your work, and that can be very demanding. It’s completely understandable that would be exhausting. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm. Let me think. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Fell from a tree. Badly set, I think. Still aches sometimes, when it’s cold. And… I had the flu, many times. Everyone gets the flu. My ex-wife… she always took me to the doctor for everything. I don't remember much of it. She handled all that. I just… did the makeup. Is this important? Perhaps I should call her? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t feel you need to call her, Mr. Szmyd. We can work with what you remember. The broken arm is good to know, and the flu is helpful, too. We're mostly trying to understand if you have any ongoing health conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes, or if you've had any serious illnesses in the past. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions ever?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… no. Not that I recall. She—my ex-wife—she might have mentioned something, once. About my… nerves? She said I worried too much. That’s not a diagnosis, is it? I just… I need things to be perfect. Everything in its place. The colors, the angles… It’s a gift, really. A very stressful gift. And I take my vitamins. Every day. Lots of them. They’re expensive, too.
DOCTOR: It sounds like she was concerned about your anxiety, and that's good to know. While worrying isn't a diagnosis in itself, it's definitely something we can talk about. It's very common, and there are things we can do to help. And taking vitamins is good. Do you recall which vitamins you take, and how much of each?
PATIENT: Hmm. So many… little pills. There’s… a big bottle of multi-vitamins. For energy, I think. And… fish oil? She said it was good for the brain. And… something for the joints? My knees ache, you know. And… oh yes! Something red. Little red capsules. For… circulation? I really don't pay attention. She just told me to take them with breakfast. I just… swallow them. It’s a habit, really. A very expensive habit. She always bought the good ones, from the health food store.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like you’re taking a multi-vitamin, fish oil, something for your joints, and a circulation supplement. We can talk about those later to see if they're appropriate for you. Now, are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Prescription… ah. Let me think. No. No, I don't think so. She—my ex-wife—she gave me something for sleep, once. Little blue pills. But I didn’t like them. Made me feel… strange. So I stopped taking them. Didn't need them anyway. Just needed a good night’s sleep. Which is hard to come by, with all the worrying. And the lights, of course. Very bright lights. That’s probably it. No, no prescriptions. Definitely not. Just vitamins. Lots and lots of vitamins.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No current prescriptions, just the vitamins. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t like liver. But that’s not an allergy, is it? And… I get itchy sometimes, when I use certain makeup. The cheap stuff, mostly. The good brands are fine. But I haven’t had any… serious reactions. Nothing that required a doctor. Just a little itch. That’s all. No, no allergies. Definitely not. Although… my ex-wife said I was allergic to responsibility. But that's not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's definitely not a medical allergy, Mr. Szmyd. Just a little itch from some makeup is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she died when I was young. Very young. I don’t remember much about it. She was… sickly, I think. Always coughing. My father… he was a strong man. A carpenter. He lived a long life. But he… drank. A lot. And he smoked. Cigarettes. Terrible habit. He died of… something. I don’t remember what. My sister… she lives in Russia. I haven’t spoken to her in many years. She’s probably fine. She always was very… resilient. No, I don’t think anyone in my family had any… serious problems. Just… life. You know? Life happens.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like your mother was ill, and your father had some unhealthy habits. It’s often difficult to remember details about family health history. To move forward, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. We can start with your blood pressure and heart rate, and then listen to your lungs and heart. Just a quick check to get a baseline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Hmm. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Makes me nervous. But… alright. Alright, I suppose. If it’s quick. And gentle. No needles, right? You promised. Blood pressure… I always worry about that. My father had high blood pressure, I think. It’s probably hereditary. Just be quick, Doctor. And gentle. And no needles. Please. I have a show next week, you know. Very important show.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. No needles today, I promise. And I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll just do a basic check to get a better understanding of your overall health. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. If you could just lie down on the table, we can start with your blood pressure. It's good you mentioned your father. Knowing that history is helpful.
PATIENT: Alright. But hurry, please. The lights… they bother me, you know. Very bright lights. And try not to poke too much. I'm a sensitive man. An artist. We bruise easily. Is that cuff… tight? It feels a bit tight. Perhaps it’s my imagination. Just get it over with, quickly, please.
DOCTOR: It's a little snug, yes, but it's necessary to get an accurate reading, Mr. Szmyd. It only takes a few moments. I’ll let you know when I’m starting. Okay, taking your blood pressure now… 148 over 92. A little elevated, Mr. Szmyd. Not drastically so, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart. Relax and take some deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Good. And finally, I’ll listen to your lungs. Take deep breaths in and out…
PATIENT: Deep breaths… difficult. The air feels… thin. And my chest… it feels a bit tight. Not a good feeling. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… concerned. Are my lungs… bad? I told you, the lights! They’re terrible for the lungs. I should have brought a fan. Or a mask. This is terrible. Just get it over with, quickly, please. Is everything alright? Tell me the truth. Are my lungs… okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd, take a few slow, deep breaths. You’re doing fine. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. They sound perfectly healthy, to be honest. It sounds like you're a little anxious, which can make you feel short of breath, but there’s nothing concerning in your lungs. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, too, likely due to the anxiety. Overall, the physical exam is normal, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate. However, we need to investigate why your blood pressure is a bit high and address your anxiety. To help us get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some routine blood work. This will help us check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We'll also do a basic EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work…? More poking and prodding? An EKG…? What is an EKG? Is that… painful? I don’t like this, Doctor. I really don’t like this. Can't you just… prescribe me something for the anxiety? A little pill to calm me down? I don’t need all these tests. I’m an artist. I’m sensitive! Tests are… stressful. And what if the results are… bad? What if something is seriously wrong? I’m too old for this. Just a pill, Doctor. Please. Just a little pill to calm me down. It's all this stress, you see. The show… the lights… the worrying. It's too much. Just a pill. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. You're right, the tests can be stressful, and I want to assure you that we'll take everything at your pace. While I can understand wanting a quick fix, prescribing medication without knowing the underlying cause of your anxiety and elevated blood pressure wouldn’t be the responsible thing to do. The blood work and EKG will give us valuable information so we can determine the best course of treatment. The blood work is just a small sample taken from your arm, and the EKG is painless – we just attach a few stickers to your chest to monitor your heart rhythm. It’s quick and easy. We can discuss the results together and decide on a plan that works for you, whether that includes medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. Would you be willing to consider the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes…? What kind of lifestyle changes? Do you mean… stop worrying? That’s impossible! It’s my nature! And what if the results are… frightening? I don’t want to know if I’m… dying. Alright. Alright, fine. But quickly, please. And gently. No needles, you promised. And tell me everything is going to be alright. Please. Just tell me everything is going to be alright. And if the results are bad… don’t tell me. Just give me a pill. A very strong pill. And let me go home. I have a show to prepare for, you know. Very important show. Quickly, please. And gently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We'll take things one step at a time. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. The lab technician is very skilled and will explain everything clearly. I can’t promise you that everything is going to be alright, but I can promise you that we’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and develop a plan to help you feel better. We’ll discuss the results together, and you can decide how much information you want to know. If you’re not comfortable with a specific test or treatment, we’ll explore other options. Let’s head to the lab now. The nurse will draw your blood, and then we’ll do the EKG right here in the clinic. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright. But hurry, please. The lights… they’re making my head spin. And tell the nurse… be gentle. Very gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And no surprises, please. Just tell me when it’s over. Just tell me when it’s over. And no needles… you promised. I don't like surprises. Just get it over with. And quickly. Very quickly. I have a show to prepare for. Very important show.
DOCTOR: We’re almost there, Mr. Szmyd. The nurse is expecting us. Her name is Maria, and she’s very gentle and experienced. She'll explain everything clearly before she starts. Maria, this is Mr. Szmyd. He’s going to have some blood work and an EKG done. Alright, here we are. Maria will take good care of you. Take a deep breath, and remember, we’re right here if you need anything. .
