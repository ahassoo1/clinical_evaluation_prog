DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Korrell. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe it was called an endo test, and they weren’t quite right. That’s why I’m here, to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: An “endo test,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what the paperwork called it. It involved… well, a small camera, I recall. They sent a tube down, and looked at my stomach and… intestines, I believe. The results came back with something abnormal, and I haven’t the slightest idea what that means. I apologize if I’m being vague; medical things are rather new to me.
DOCTOR: Right. An endoscopy. Yes, that would explain the “tube down.” Abnormal findings… well, that’s rather unhelpful on its own, isn't it?
PATIENT: Indeed. It’s quite frustrating, actually. The letter mentioned something about… inflammation, perhaps? And a small growth. But no explanation of what that means for me. I’ve been feeling… a little tired lately, but I attributed that to my age, truthfully. Is the inflammation serious, Doctor? And this growth… is it something I should be terribly concerned about?
DOCTOR: Let’s pull up those results here. Inflammation… and a growth. Yes. Well, Ms. Minatra, "inflammation" is your body's response to something, could be any number of things. And growths…those need investigating. Do you have a copy of the report with you?
PATIENT: I do, thankfully. I always like to have a copy of everything, you see. Here it is. Though, I warn you, I’m not sure I’ll be able to decipher much of it. It’s filled with… terminology I don't understand. Is it alright if you simply explain what’s most important?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, quite a bit of jargon here. It seems the endoscopy revealed mild inflammation in the antrum of the stomach, and a small polyp in the descending colon. Now, the polyp is the more concerning finding. We need to determine what type of polyp it is. Is there any family history of colon cancer or polyps?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… Oh dear. No, not that I’m aware of. My husband… he passed away some years ago, and his family wasn’t terribly forthcoming with medical information, truthfully. I had a sister, but she… she didn’t live a long life, and I don’t recall anything about her health specifically. So, no, Doctor. No family history that I know of. What does this polyp mean? Is it… dangerous? Is this something that requires immediate attention? I apologize for all the questions, I am simply… anxious.
DOCTOR: Understandable, Ms. Minatra. A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue in the colon lining. Most are benign – harmless. However, some can become cancerous over time. That’s why it’s important to investigate. We'll need to do a colonoscopy, if you haven’t had one recently. It allows us to visualize the entire colon and remove the polyp for biopsy – that is, to examine it under a microscope to determine its type. Have you had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve had… various tests over the years, but nothing quite like that, I don’t think. It sounds… unpleasant. Is it painful? And what does “biopsy” entail, exactly? I’m trying to prepare myself for what’s to come, you see. This is all very new to me, and a little frightening, truthfully. I do hope it isn’t too invasive.
DOCTOR: It’s not entirely comfortable, no. But we do give you sedation to make it more tolerable. You’ll be asleep during the procedure. As for the biopsy, it involves taking a small sample of the polyp tissue with a tiny instrument passed through the colonoscope. It shouldn’t be particularly painful; you shouldn’t feel it. The important thing is to get this assessed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Sedation… that sounds… reassuring. I confess, the thought of being awake for this procedure was quite alarming. So, I’ll be asleep, and you’ll take a small sample. And then… what happens? Do you know if the results take long to come back? And if it is something… concerning, what are the next steps? I know I’m asking a lot, but I like to be prepared. It’s just… it’s hard to think clearly when you’re worried.
DOCTOR: Quite alright, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly reasonable to ask questions. The sample will be sent to pathology, and the results typically take about a week. If it’s benign, we’ll likely schedule regular surveillance colonoscopies to monitor it. If it’s abnormal, we’ll discuss further treatment options, which could include removing more tissue, or, in rare cases, surgery. But let's not jump to conclusions. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We'll schedule the colonoscopy, get it done, and then we'll have a clearer picture. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that does sound… sensible. To proceed with the colonoscopy, and wait for the results. That’s… a plan. I suppose worrying beforehand won’t change anything. Very well, Doctor Korrell. Let’s schedule it. When would be a good time? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? Any special diets or… anything at all? I want to be as ready as possible. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. It has eased my mind considerably.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… we have an opening next Tuesday afternoon. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday afternoon would be perfectly acceptable. That gives me a little time to… prepare myself mentally, I suppose. And to arrange for someone to take me home, naturally. Thank you again, Doctor. What about the preparations? What do I need to do before the procedure? Is there anything specific I need to avoid?
DOCTOR: You’ll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure. No solid foods. And you’ll need to take a bowel preparation – a laxative – the day before to completely empty your colon. We’ll give you detailed instructions when you check in, but essentially it will involve drinking a large amount of a special solution. It’s… unpleasant, but essential for a clear view during the colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A clear liquid diet… and a… solution. I see. That does not sound particularly appealing, but I understand it’s necessary. I suppose I can manage. What liquids are allowed? And is there anything I should avoid completely, even within the “clear liquid” category? I want to be absolutely certain I do everything correctly. I wouldn’t want to have to reschedule due to improper preparation. And… will I be able to drive myself home afterwards, or will I need someone to accompany me?
DOCTOR: Clear liquids include broth, clear juices – apple, cranberry – gelatin, and water. Avoid anything red or purple, as it can be mistaken for blood during the procedure. And you absolutely cannot drive yourself home. The sedation will impair your judgment and reflexes. You must have someone accompany you, and they'll need to stay with you for a few hours afterwards. It’s a strict requirement. Do you have a designated driver already?
PATIENT: Yes, thankfully, my neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez, has kindly offered to take me and bring me home. She’s a very good woman. No red or purple liquids… I’ll remember that. Broth, apple juice, gelatin… and water. I think I can manage that. And no driving… I expected that, truthfully. Well, Doctor Korrell, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you again for your patience and clear explanations. I feel… a little less anxious, at least. I suppose I’ll see you next Tuesday then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Minatra. We’ll get you checked in and go over all the instructions again. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. We'll see you next Tuesday. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I will certainly call if anything arises. Goodbye, Doctor Korrell.
