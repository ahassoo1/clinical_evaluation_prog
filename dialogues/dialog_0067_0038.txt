DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pfennig. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I believe I am here to discuss something regarding future care, should the need arise. A friend suggested I look into an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? Honestly, I don’t entirely recall the specifics, and the details are… fuzzy. I simply want to be prepared, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Evann. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both excellent ways to ensure your wishes are known should you ever be unable to speak for yourself. Let’s start with the Advance Directive. That covers a broader range of situations and allows you to name someone to make healthcare decisions on your behalf, and to outline your values and preferences. Have you had any prior discussions with family members about this, or do you have anyone in mind as a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… I… believe my sister, Naraa, would be the most appropriate person. Though, to be frank, Doctor, our conversations haven’t been… detailed, regarding these matters. We haven’t specifically discussed who would make decisions, or what those decisions might be. It’s been… some time since we last spoke at length. I am divorced, and my ex-husband… well, that’s not a viable option. I suppose I would need to contact Naraa and discuss this with her. Is that correct? And… what exactly is involved in outlining my “values and preferences”? It sounds… daunting.
DOCTOR: Yes, contacting Naraa is the first step. She would need to be willing and able to act as your healthcare proxy. It’s important she understands your wishes. As for outlining your values and preferences, it doesn’t have to be daunting. It’s about thinking through different scenarios – what kind of medical care you’d want if you were seriously ill, what’s important to you in terms of quality of life, and whether there are any specific treatments you would or would not want. This pamphlet has some helpful questions to get you started. Now, a POLST form – that’s a bit different. It's a medical order, specifically for individuals with a serious illness or frailty. It details what medical treatments you want, or don’t want, right now. It’s more concrete than an Advance Directive. Given your age and stated health, we likely don't need to focus on that form today, but it's good to be aware of it. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. An Advance Directive is more… general, and a POLST form is specific to current medical conditions. I understand. It seems… odd to think about outlining what I wouldn’t want, but I suppose it’s responsible. I suppose starting with the Advance Directive and discussing it with Naraa is the most sensible approach. Are there forms I need to complete, or is this something we do collaboratively? And… will Naraa need to be present for any of this? I apologize for all the questions; I simply want to ensure I’m doing this correctly.
DOCTOR: No questions at all, Evann. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed, and wanting to do this correctly is exactly what you should be doing. There is a form, yes. It outlines the sections we'll need to cover – your healthcare proxy, your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, and any other specific preferences you may have. We can go through it together, and I can answer any questions you have along the way. Naraa doesn’t need to be present for the initial form completion, but she will need to sign it as a witness once it’s complete, and ideally, we should discuss her role and responsibilities with her present. It's important she understands what she’s agreeing to. Would you like to start working through the form now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Starting now would be… helpful. It asks for Naraa’s full legal name and contact information. I believe I have that readily available. This section regarding “healthcare decisions”... does this pertain to all medical scenarios, or are there exceptions? And, if I were to… change my mind at a later date, could this document be altered?
DOCTOR: That's a great question. This section about healthcare decisions is intended to cover a broad range of medical scenarios, but you can be as specific as you like. You can outline preferences for different conditions, or indicate that your healthcare proxy has discretion to make decisions based on the situation. As you can see here, it states you can revoke or change this document at any time, as long as you are competent to make those changes. It's a living document, really. It should reflect your current wishes. And yes, you're right to think about it being a “living document”. It’s a good idea to review it periodically, especially after any significant life event or change in your health. Let’s start with Naraa’s information. Do you have her full legal name and contact details handy?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Her full name is Naraa Buoniconti, with a “c” – B-U-O-N-I-C-O-N-T-I. Her address is… Oh dear. It appears I have the old address. She moved approximately six months ago. I do, however, have her mobile phone number. Would that suffice, for now? I apologize for the inconvenience. My memory… isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. Addresses change! Her mobile number will work for now. We can update the address later when you have it. So, mobile number… And regarding your memory, that’s very common. It doesn't diminish your ability to make these important decisions. It just means we might take a little extra time, and that’s perfectly fine. Now, let's move on to outlining your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. This is where you can indicate your preferences for things like mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition and hydration. It can be a difficult topic, but it's important to think about what's important to you. Would you like to discuss each option individually, or would you prefer to start with a more general conversation about your values and beliefs?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather overwhelming, Doctor. Perhaps a general conversation about my values and beliefs would be best, to begin with. I believe… quality of life is paramount. Prolonging life at all costs, without any semblance of dignity or comfort… that doesn't appeal to me. I cherish my independence, and I wouldn’t want to be a burden to others. I value my mind, as well, and… losing that would be… deeply distressing. I suppose those are my core values. How does that translate into… medical decisions? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Evann. That’s a very clear and thoughtful articulation of your values. Quality of life, independence, and preserving your cognitive function – those are excellent guiding principles. In terms of medical decisions, that would likely mean prioritizing comfort and symptom management over aggressive interventions if you were seriously ill and unable to recover. It would mean focusing on treatments that would help you maintain your dignity and independence as long as possible. It also suggests we might want to discuss a "Do Not Resuscitate" order, which would indicate your wishes regarding CPR in the event of cardiac arrest. That's something we can discuss further, but it’s important to know that it's an option. Now, let's move on to the next section, which asks about your preferences for artificial nutrition and hydration. This is where you can indicate whether you would want to receive these types of support if you were unable to eat or drink on your own. Would you like to discuss that in more detail, or would you like to take a break for a moment?
PATIENT: That… that is a difficult question. I believe… I would want to avoid prolonged suffering, if possible. Being sustained artificially… it doesn’t sound appealing. Unless… there was a reasonable expectation of recovery? If it was a temporary situation? But if it was… clear that there was no hope… then, no. I would prefer not to be kept alive artificially. Though… I feel terrible saying that. It sounds… callous. I apologize for being so indecisive. This is all rather overwhelming, and I don't want to make the wrong choice.
DOCTOR: You are not being indecisive at all, Evann. These are incredibly difficult questions, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and uncertain. And you are absolutely not being callous. It's responsible to think through these scenarios and express your wishes, even if it's difficult. So, what I’m hearing is that you would want artificial nutrition and hydration if there was a reasonable expectation of recovery. But if it was clear there was no hope, you would prefer not to be sustained artificially. We can certainly document that. Now, let’s move on to the final section of this form, which asks about your healthcare proxy’s authority. This is where you can specify what decisions your proxy is authorized to make on your behalf. Do you want them to have the authority to make all healthcare decisions, or would you like to limit their authority in any way?
PATIENT: All healthcare decisions… Yes, I believe that would be best. Naraa is a sensible woman, and I trust her judgment implicitly. Though… perhaps with a caveat? Perhaps she should consult with another family member before making any… major decisions? Just for a second opinion? I don't want her to feel unduly burdened by the responsibility. It seems… unfair to place that entirely on her shoulders. Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: That is absolutely possible, and a very thoughtful suggestion, Evann. It’s wise to consider the burden on your proxy and to ensure there’s a support system in place. We can certainly document that Naraa should consult with another family member before making any major healthcare decisions. Perhaps you could specify who that family member should be?
PATIENT: My nephew, Temujin, would be the most appropriate person. He is a physician, and I trust his medical expertise implicitly. Though… he lives quite far away. Perhaps… either Temujin, if available, or my sister’s husband, Baatar? Would that suffice? I apologize for being so… particular. I simply want to ensure that Naraa has access to sound advice, if she needs it.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. That's perfectly reasonable and responsible. We can document that Naraa should consult with either Temujin, if available, or Baatar before making any major healthcare decisions. Alright, I believe we’ve completed the Advance Directive. Would you like me to print it out for you to review and sign?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. I feel… much better having completed this. It’s a weight off my shoulders. I do appreciate your patience and understanding. And… thank you for not judging my indecisiveness.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed by these decisions, and I’m glad I could help. Take your time reviewing it, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Now, we discussed the POLST form briefly earlier. Given your age and overall health, it’s not something we need to focus on today. However, I do want to ensure you have a copy of this Advance Directive readily available, and that Naraa is aware of its location. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most helpful, and I am grateful for your time and patience. I will ensure Naraa receives a copy of this document immediately. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. Have a pleasant day. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Evann. You have a pleasant day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. .
