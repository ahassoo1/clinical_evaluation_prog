DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Well, it’s a bit…difficult to explain, truthfully. It’s been happening for some time now, and frankly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I believe…I’m going to the bathroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. It’s just…a lot of water, you see.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. Okay. And how long has this "more than usual" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s the tricky part. Several weeks, I believe. Perhaps a month? It's hard to pinpoint. I…I’ve not kept strict track, you understand. It just gradually became…noticeable. Is that helpful? I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verbos. We'll work through it. “Several weeks” is a start. Now, is it mostly during the day, or are you waking up at night to urinate as well?
PATIENT: Hmm. Both, I think. Though…perhaps more at night. I do find myself getting up once, sometimes twice, during the night. It disrupts my sleep, naturally. Not terribly, but enough to notice. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking up one or two times a night to urinate. And when you do go, is it a full bladder emptying each time, or just a small amount?
PATIENT: Usually…full. Yes, I believe so. A normal amount, if you will. Not just a trickle, certainly. It feels…complete, each time. Though, after a short while, the feeling returns. It's a bit…contradictory to explain, I realize.
DOCTOR: Contradictory is fine, Mr. Verbos, we're trying to figure things out. So, full emptying, but the urge returns relatively soon after. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a bit. And no burning sensation either. It's simply…the frequency, you understand? And the disruption to my sleep, of course. It’s more of an inconvenience than anything, truthfully. Though a bothersome one, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain or burning. We’ve established frequent urination, more noticeable at night, with full emptying, but the urge returns relatively quickly. Now, have you noticed any changes in your thirst?
PATIENT: Changes in…thirst? Hmm. That's a good question. Perhaps…a little more thirsty than usual, yes. I do find myself reaching for a glass of water more often. But I also live in a rather warm apartment, so I’ve attributed it to the weather, to be honest. I drink plenty of water, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially increased thirst, but attributed to the weather. Alright. Now, let’s talk about other fluids. Do you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages – coffee, tea, soda?
PATIENT: Ah, coffee. A small indulgence, yes. Perhaps two cups in the morning. I enjoy the ritual, you see. Nothing excessive, I assure you. No soda, and I rarely drink tea. Mostly just water, as I said. And occasionally, a small glass of wine with dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, two cups of coffee in the morning, occasional glass of wine. And, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite…no, not really. I eat much as I always have. Perhaps a little less in the summer, it's too hot to have a large meal. As for weight… I haven't weighed myself in some time, actually. I suppose I haven’t noticed any significant changes, but I don't keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. We've covered quite a bit. Before we proceed, let me ask you one more question. Any family history of diabetes or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes…hmm. My mother…I believe her sister had something of the sort, yes. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. As for prostate problems… not that I am aware of. My father…he was a robust man, perfectly healthy as far as I know. It’s all a bit hazy, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Verbos, based on what you’ve told me – the frequent urination, particularly at night, the increased thirst, and the family history – it could be a few things. The most likely, given everything, is Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia – or BPH – an enlarged prostate. It’s common in men your age, and can cause these symptoms. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like diabetes, or a urinary tract infection. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. We'll also need to do a prostate exam. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: A prostate exam…? Oh dear. Well… I suppose so. If it’s necessary. It doesn't sound particularly pleasant, but I trust your judgement, Doctor. A urinalysis and blood test are perfectly acceptable, of course. Though…perhaps you could explain a little more about this… BPH? It's not a term I'm familiar with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. BPH simply means the prostate gland gets larger as you age. It's very common, and it's not usually anything to worry about, but it can press on the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your bladder – causing the symptoms you’re experiencing. The exam involves a quick digital rectal exam – I'll insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size and shape of your prostate. It's not comfortable, but it's very quick – usually just a few seconds. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the blood test will rule out diabetes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A…digital rectal exam. Oh. Well. Yes, I believe I understand. It doesn’t sound…ideal. But, as you say, if it's necessary. I suppose I trust your professional opinion, Doctor. Infection and diabetes… it's best to be certain, of course. So, yes. Let us proceed with the tests. When can we schedule these?
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. We can do the urinalysis right away. I'll have the nurse come in and collect a sample. The blood test, we can do that in the lab next door, it will only take a few minutes. And the exam, we can do that right here, right now, or if you'd prefer, we can schedule it for another day. It’s up to you. I understand it’s not comfortable. We’ll get you a gown, and I’ll explain everything step-by-step. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Perhaps… perhaps it’s best to get it over with. Now, if you don't mind. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can… well, the sooner I can know what’s going on. Yes. Now, if you would be so kind as to explain the procedure… and then… proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. I’ll have the nurse bring in a gown. You'll lie on your side on the examination table. I'll lubricate a gloved finger and gently insert it into your rectum. I'll feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It shouldn't hurt, but you may feel some pressure. It will only take a few seconds. I will explain each step as I go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No… I don't believe so. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. And… explain everything, as you promised. I confess, I'm a bit… apprehensive. But I trust you. Let us… proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verbos. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. The nurse will be in shortly with the gown. Just lie down on the table once she's finished, and we’ll get started. Remember, it's quick, and it's important to get a proper diagnosis. .
