DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. So, you’re here today… tell me what brought you in. Don’t leave anything out, even if it seems small. I've got a feeling this is going to be… interesting.
PATIENT: Well, frankly, it’s about having a baby. And I’d like to do it right this time. No… complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’m 51. I want to be sure everything works before… well, before it’s too late. I had one already, years ago, but I want another, and a healthy one. Is that clear enough? Don't need a life-story, just the important bits.
DOCTOR: Right. A healthy baby at 51. Ambitious. And yes, that’s… clear. We'll need to do some thorough investigating, of course. Just to be… sure everything is working as it should. First, let's talk about your previous pregnancy. Can you tell me a bit about that one?
PATIENT: It was… decades ago. A boy. Perfectly normal, as far as I recall. Gained a bit of weight during it, naturally. Standard stuff. No unusual difficulties, though my ex-husband, may he rot, always complained about everything. It ended… amicably, shall we say. He wanted a girl. Honestly, the entire situation was a headache. Is knowing about him important? I was married young, a mistake. Now, what exactly are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: Right, amicably. And no, I don't need a detailed biography of your ex-husband, thank you. Though... a history of complications is important. And honestly, even marital stress can play a role in… well, things. Let’s focus on your health during that pregnancy. Were there any gestational diabetes?
PATIENT: Gestational… what now? Look, I wasn't exactly taking medical classes while I was pregnant. I ate what I wanted, within reason, and the doctors told me everything was fine. Maybe I gained a little extra weight. Is that what you’re getting at? They checked my blood, of course, standard things. Everything came back normal. Perfectly normal. I had a good doctor back then. Rural, of course, not fancy like this, but competent.
DOCTOR: Right. "Perfectly normal." Well, we'll need to verify that, of course. Things change over decades, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm just being thorough. Do you have any history of diabetes or high blood pressure now?
PATIENT: Now? No. Absolutely not. I watch my weight. I don't eat a lot of sweets, though I do enjoy a good strudel occasionally. Blood pressure? Never had a problem. I exercise, walk the dog, keep myself active. I'm perfectly healthy for my age. Honestly, I suspect I'm healthier than most people your age. Now, are we going to do something or just… chat all day? I have errands, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Very active. We will do something. But first, we need some baseline information. A physical exam is essential. And some blood work. Just to… confirm everything. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. Can I start with your weight and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Finally. Sensible. Yes, go ahead. Get it over with. I already told you I'm perfectly healthy. I'm 86 kilograms, roughly, and my blood pressure is… I haven’t checked it recently. Probably fine. Honestly, this is all a waste of time, but if you must… Just don’t keep me all day. I have a bicycle to repair. A very expensive one.
DOCTOR: Alright. 86 kilograms, noted. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, Ms. Shteynberg. Not alarming, but something we’ll want to monitor. Let’s move on to a quick abdominal exam and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a general overview. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Elevated? See, this is precisely what I feared. You’re going to tell me I'm a mess, aren’t you? I told you I probably hadn't checked my blood pressure recently! A little stress, you know, with everything. And I just had a strong coffee. Really, all this fuss over a coffee and a little walking. But fine, go ahead. Just be quick about it. I'm not comfortable in these… medical situations.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Nothing obviously concerning, Ms. Shteynberg. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medications, allergies, and family history. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. A little Vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. But no prescriptions, no pills, no potions. And I don’t have allergies, thank goodness. Family history? My mother lived to be 90, perfectly healthy. Her secret? Strudel, probably. My father… well, he wasn’t very healthy, let’s just say. Chain smoker. That’s why I avoid those… habits. Are we getting anywhere with this, or just collecting pointless information?
DOCTOR: Right. Strudel. Interesting. And a history of smoking in the family is noted. Now, about your previous pregnancy… Do you remember any details about the prenatal care you received?
PATIENT: Details? Honestly, it was decades ago. Rural clinic, basic checkups. They measured my belly, took my blood. They told me the baby was healthy. Nothing fancy. No ultrasounds every week like you young women have these days. Just the standard stuff. The doctor was… thorough, I suppose. He delivered the baby safely, and that's all that mattered. Honestly, I remember more about the annoyance of it all than the actual care. The waiting rooms, the endless questions… Now, are we done with the past? I’d like to focus on the future.
DOCTOR: Right. The future. To assess your suitability for pregnancy at 51, we need to be thorough, Ms. Shteynberg. I need to order some blood work, including hormone levels, a complete metabolic panel, and a full lipid panel. And an EKG is a good idea, given your elevated blood pressure. These tests will give us a baseline to evaluate your overall health and determine if you are a candidate for pregnancy. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever it takes. Just get it over with. Hormone levels, lipid panels, EKGs… honestly, you're treating me like a science experiment. But if it means I can have a healthy baby, then yes, consent. Just don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. And please, try to be as quick as possible. I have a very valuable bicycle waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take this to the lab down the hall. They’ll draw the blood and do the EKG. It will take approximately an hour. I'll review the results when they’re available, and we can discuss them then. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. You've made your opinion perfectly clear, I suspect. I'm an old woman trying to have a baby, and you're going to run a bunch of tests to prove it's a bad idea. Honestly, just tell me, straight up: Do you think I’m wasting my time? Be honest. Save me the hour in the lab.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg. Pregnancy at 51 does carry significant risks. The chance of complications – miscarriage, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities – is substantially higher. It's… not ideal. However, everyone is different. And until we see your lab results, I can't definitively say whether or not it's a viable option. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us make an informed decision. I'm not trying to dismiss your desires, but I need to be realistic with you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please proceed to the lab. .
PATIENT: Realistic. Of course. Everyone says that. Well. I’m not afraid of a little risk. I've lived a long life. A few complications won't scare me. Strudel and a bicycle. That's a better plan than listening to patronizing doctors, anyway. .
