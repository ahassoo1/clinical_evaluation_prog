DOCTOR: Good morning, Marquie. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Good morning. It's… it's my breathing, I think. It's been… hard. Like, I get really short of breath, just doing normal stuff. Honestly, it's been happening for a little while now, but it's gotten worse recently. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s common to not remember exact dates. So, you’ve been experiencing shortness of breath, and it's been gradually worsening. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "normal stuff"?
PATIENT: Yeah, um… like, walking up the stairs. Or even just walking to the mailbox. Things I used to do without thinking. Now I have to… stop and catch my breath. Sometimes even talking feels hard. It’s… frustrating. My wife has noticed too, she keeps telling me I sound winded. I work… I work with water, at the plant… and even that's been harder lately. I don’t know if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes a difference, thank you for telling me. Working with water could be relevant. So, shortness of breath with everyday activities like walking, stairs, and even talking. And it's impacting your work at the plant. Has this shortness of breath been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me see. I think… sometimes my chest feels tight. Not always, but when I’m really struggling to breathe. And… I get tired easier, I guess. Like, really tired. I just figured it was from working, but maybe it's connected? Honestly, I’m not sure. I haven't really paid much attention. I don't really… go to the doctor often.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness with the shortness of breath, and increased fatigue. It's good you're bringing this up now. We'll figure things out. Do you notice any coughing with this, and if so, is there anything specific about the cough—like, is it dry, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Coughing… yeah, sometimes. It's not… constant. More like when I'm really trying to catch my breath, I'll cough a little bit. It's usually… dry. Not much comes up, if anything. Just feels like a tickle in my throat. I really don’t know much about it, Doctor. Sorry. It just… happens sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being unclear at all, Marquie. It's helpful to know it's an occasional dry cough. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. I've never been told I have anything like that. I mean, I've been sick, like, with colds and the flu, of course. But never anything… serious, that a doctor told me about. I haven’t really… needed to go to the doctor much in my life. I really don't remember ever being told I had a lung problem. Is that a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a bad sign, Marquie. It just helps me understand your history. Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Um… my father, he… he smoked for a long time. He had some breathing problems when he got older, I think. But I don’t… I don’t really know what specifically. He didn’t really talk about it much. And my mother, she was pretty healthy, as far as I know. No… no lung problems that I remember. It was a long time ago though, so… I don't really have a lot of details. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Your father had some breathing problems, and your mother was generally healthy. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke. Never have. My wife… she tried it once, a long time ago, but she didn’t like it. She doesn't either. I always thought it was bad for you, especially after… well, after my father. I always tried to stay away from it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, sometimes. Not a lot. Maybe a beer or a glass of wine with dinner, on the weekends. Nothing crazy. I don't drink every day, or anything. It’s just… relaxing sometimes. My wife drinks with me sometimes too. Nothing that would… cause a problem, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. Absolutely not. I don't… I don't do any of that. I don't have any experience with any of that. Just wanted to make that clear. I hope that's okay.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, and thank you for being open with me. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around… cats, I think. But it's not a bad allergy, just a little sneeze here and there. And I think… I think I'm a little sensitive to certain perfumes, but that’s about it. No serious allergies that I know of. Nothing I have to carry an EpiPen for, or anything like that. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild allergies to cats and perfumes. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe… maybe some ibuprofen for a headache sometimes, if it’s really bad. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking medicine if I can. I don't like feeling… all those side effects. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that. Just the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Marquie. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope you can figure out what's wrong. It’s been worrying my wife, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me too. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope, and then I’ll check your heart rate and blood pressure. Then I'll take a look at your throat and check your oxygen levels with a small clip on your finger. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, Marquie. That means there’s some narrowing of the airways. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 92 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Both are within normal limits, but we’ll keep an eye on them. Your throat looks clear. Your oxygen level is 94%, which is good. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I suspect you may be experiencing some early symptoms of asthma or possibly bronchitis. The wheezing in your lungs suggests some airway inflammation. However, to get a more definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uh… a chest X-ray and a test? Is that… is that serious? I mean, I don't want anything… too invasive. I just… I just want to be able to breathe again. I don’t really… like hospitals. But… if you think it’s necessary, I guess so. If it’ll help figure out what's wrong. What does the test involve? And… will it hurt? Sorry, I’m just… nervous. I don’t really understand all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Marquie, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. The chest X-ray is a simple imaging test that takes a picture of your lungs. It doesn’t involve any needles or invasive procedures. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds while the picture is taken. It’s painless and doesn’t involve any radiation exposure. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a tube connected to a machine. It measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It also doesn't involve any needles and is painless, but you will need to follow some specific instructions to make sure we get an accurate reading. Both tests are standard procedures and will help us determine the cause of your shortness of breath and guide our treatment plan. It's important to get a clear understanding of what's going on so we can get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Okay… breathing into a tube… and a picture… That doesn’t sound too bad, I guess. Not like surgery or anything. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, so… I don’t want to get a huge bill. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to get back to work, you know. My wife… she’s been picking up the slack, but we really need the money. I just… I just want to know what’s going on, and I want to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Marquie. That's a very valid point, and it's something we can definitely discuss. I will have the billing department give you an estimate of the costs for both tests before we proceed, and we can explore options for financial assistance if needed. This clinic does have a program to help patients without insurance, and we can also discuss payment plans. The tests usually take about 30-45 minutes to complete, and the results typically come back within 24-48 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I can give you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler to help relieve your shortness of breath. It works by opening up your airways, and it may provide some temporary relief while we wait for the test results. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… to help me breathe now? Yeah, that sounds… good. Really good. I could really use something to help me breathe. Just… what are the side effects? And… is it addictive? I don't want to get hooked on anything. I just… I just want to be able to work and take care of my wife. This shortness of breath is making everything so hard.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Marquie. It’s good you’re asking about side effects. The most common side effects of bronchodilators are mild and include a slightly increased heart rate, nervousness, and sometimes a tremor in your hands. These side effects usually go away as your body gets used to the medication. It is not addictive. It doesn’t cause dependence or withdrawal symptoms. It simply helps to relax the muscles around your airways, making it easier to breathe. I'll prescribe you a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler, which means it provides relief when you're experiencing symptoms. We'll start with a low dose, and we can adjust it as needed. I’ll give you instructions on how to use it properly, and I'll ask you to monitor your symptoms closely. We’ll also schedule the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test for tomorrow morning. And remember, I'm here to answer any questions or concerns you may have along the way. Does this sound like a plan you're comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… okay. A plan sounds good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And thank you for not making me feel like I’m silly for asking so many questions. Let’s do the tests tomorrow. And… thank you for the inhaler. I hope it helps. I really hope it helps. What time should I come in for the tests? And… should I bring anything with me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. It's my job to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable. There’s no such thing as a silly question when it comes to your health. Tomorrow, please come in at 9:00 AM. The tests shouldn’t take too long. Please bring your insurance card, even though you mentioned you're uninsured—sometimes it can help with billing. It would also be helpful if you could bring a list of any medications you've taken in the past, even over-the-counter drugs. Also, please avoid caffeine and smoking for at least 4 hours before the pulmonary function test, as these can affect the results. I'll write you a prescription for the inhaler now, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to use it. If you experience any chest pain, dizziness, or severe shortness of breath after using the inhaler, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything so well, Doctor. Thank you. Really. I’ll come in at 9:00 AM tomorrow. And I’ll remember to avoid caffeine. Thank you again. I just… I just hope I can breathe easier soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. I’m glad I could help. I’m optimistic that we'll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better soon. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you at 9:00 AM. .
