DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Burlingham. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. I have a lot of it. More than usual, you see. It is… embarrassing, sometimes. And uncomfortable. It started, I think, maybe a week ago? I’m not sure exactly.
DOCTOR: "Embarrassing," yes. Well, we all have…digestive issues from time to time. A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week, I believe. Or maybe a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. It’s not painful, exactly. More… rumbling. And it smells… not good. I eat pretty normal, I think. Nothing too fancy. Just… food. Do you need to know what food? I can try to remember everything I ate last week, if that helps.
DOCTOR: It might help, yes. Though, honestly, most foods cause gas in some people. But let's start with a basic question. Any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Changes… let me think. Not really, no. I had a pickle last Tuesday, which was a bit different, but I eat pickles sometimes. And Mrs. Petrova, my neighbor, gave me some cookies—biscotti, I think they were called—last week too. But that was only three of them. Otherwise… no, everything is about the same. I had chicken on Wednesday. And soup. Usual things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Biscotti…right. Those can be a bit rich. And pickles…well, pickles are pickles. Any new medications?
PATIENT: No, no new medications. I just take a vitamin, the usual one for older people, you know? The one with all the letters. And… nothing else. I don't really like taking pills if I can help it. I try to stay healthy. That is why I am here, you see? Something is not right. The gas is… unusual.
DOCTOR: "Unusual," yes. Well, let's try to narrow things down. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me see. No stomach pain, like I said. No… I don’t think so. Oh! Sometimes I feel a little… bloated, after I eat. Like my stomach is very full, even if I didn’t eat much. And… occasionally, a little heartburn. But not often. Just when I lie down right after eating, maybe. It's very minor. I thought it was just… old age.
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. Well, things do change as we get older, but we still want to rule things out. Bloating and occasional heartburn… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh dear. That is a… personal question. But yes, actually. I am… going to the bathroom more often, if you understand. Not diarrhea, exactly. Just… more frequently. And sometimes it's a little… softer than usual. Is that what you meant? It started around the same time as the gas, I think. Everything is connected, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Connected, yes. That's what we're trying to determine. Alright, Mr. Goodstein. I’m going to need to do a quick examination, if you don't mind. Just a listen to your abdomen, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. A listen to my… abdomen. I hope it is not too unpleasant. I am a bit… sensitive, you see. But I want to find out what is wrong. Please, go ahead. I will try to be still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie back for me, please. And try to relax. Take a deep breath… and exhale… good. Hmm. Normal bowel sounds, a little… gurgly, as expected. No tenderness that I can detect. Alright. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but nothing alarming.
PATIENT: Good. That is… reassuring. Reassuring to hear it is not… alarming. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something I ate? Or… something else? I worry sometimes. My mother… she had problems with her stomach. It’s not the same, I don’t think, but… one always worries, you see? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Goodstein, based on what you've told me and the quick examination, it could be something as simple as a bit of dietary indiscretion – meaning something you ate didn’t agree with you. However, given the change in bowel habits, we can't rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a stool sample, just to check for any infection. And a basic blood test to rule out any inflammation. We’ll get the results back in a few days. It’s best to be thorough, you see. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A stool sample… Oh dear. That does not sound pleasant. But… if it helps, then I suppose I must. And a blood test… alright. A few days, you say? That is good. I do have one question, Doctor. Is it… contagious? I sometimes visit my neighbor, Mrs. Petrova. She is… older. I wouldn’t want to make her sick. It's probably silly, but…one worries.
DOCTOR: Contagious?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is the… gas, or whatever it is, something I could give to someone else? I often share cookies with Mrs. Petrova. And we play cards. I wouldn’t want to spread anything. It is probably a silly question. But one must be careful, you see? Especially with older people.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, with all due respect, I highly doubt this is contagious. The symptoms you're describing—gas, bloating, minor changes in bowel habits—are rarely, if ever, indicative of a contagious illness. It’s much more likely to be a digestive issue. However, to be absolutely certain, and for your peace of mind, we'll still run the tests. Now, let’s focus on getting those tests scheduled. Do you have any difficulty getting to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that is good to hear, Doctor. Very good to hear. I was very worried about Mrs. Petrova. She is a dear friend. No, I do not have any difficulty getting to the lab. It is just down the street, really. I walk there every day for my newspaper. So, no problem at all. You think the tests will give us a better idea? Of what to… do? Is there anything I should stop eating in the meantime? Just in case?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us rule things out, yes. And as for what to stop eating… honestly, Mr. Goodstein, there’s no point in drastically changing your diet before we have results. But, perhaps, limit overly processed foods, excessive sugar, and… large quantities of biscotti for the time being?
PATIENT: Biscotti… yes. Perhaps you are right. I do enjoy them, but… one must be sensible. Sensible and careful. I will limit the biscotti. And the processed foods. And… sugar. I will try. So, what happens after the tests? Do I need to make another appointment? Or will you call me? I worry about missing the call, you see. My hearing isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: We will call you with the results, Mr. Goodstein. And don’t worry, we can repeat the message if necessary. We'll ensure you receive it. And yes, we will likely schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have been very patient with me. And very kind. I appreciate your help very much. I will limit the biscotti. And I will wait for the call. Thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. You're welcome. And try not to worry unnecessarily. Good day, Mr. Goodstein.
