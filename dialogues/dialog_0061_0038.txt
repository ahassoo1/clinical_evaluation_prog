DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Evann! It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though my memory isn't what it once was. I believe I’m here regarding some paperwork? Something about… planning for the future, in case of illness? I was advised to seek assistance with an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form… but the details are rather hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s very common to feel a little overwhelmed by all that paperwork, and memory can definitely play tricks on us. It sounds like you were advised to come in to discuss advance care planning – setting up what happens with your medical care if you were unable to make decisions for yourself. Both Advance Directives and POLST forms fall under that umbrella. Let me pull up your file here… Ah, yes, I see a note from Dr. Lee recommending we discuss this. Before we dive into the specifics of those forms, could you tell me a little bit about why Dr. Lee suggested this now?
PATIENT: Doctor, that is… kind of you to say. I truly wish I could recall the specifics of my conversation with Dr. Lee. It was some time ago, and… well, things don’t always stick, you see. I believe it had something to do with… a recent check-up? Perhaps a slightly concerning blood test result? Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I just want to be prepared, if that makes sense. I’d rather have these things sorted, even if I can’t quite pinpoint why it’s suddenly important.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Evann. It’s very responsible of you to want to get this sorted, even without a clear reason. Sometimes, a routine check-up can prompt these conversations, just as a preventative measure. Let’s see… reviewing your recent labs from June 12th… Your cholesterol was a little elevated, and your Vitamin D was low. Nothing immediately alarming, but Dr. Lee likely wanted to discuss preventative steps and, as you said, prepare for the future. Do you have any family history of heart disease or other chronic illnesses that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: That… rings a faint bell. The cholesterol, yes. I vaguely remember him mentioning lifestyle changes. As for family history… that is a difficult question. My parents… they passed away some years ago, when I was quite young. I didn’t spend much time with my extended family, so I don’t really know much about their medical backgrounds. I believe my mother had some issues with her… joints, perhaps? But I couldn’t say for certain. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t particularly involved in those matters. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. It’s very common not to have detailed family history information, especially if you didn't have close relationships with extended family. We can still move forward without it. So, no strong family history of heart disease that you’re aware of. Let’s talk a little bit about you then. Besides the cholesterol, do you have any other health conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I… try to stay active, though I’ve admittedly been less so lately. I work as an etcher and engraver, so it requires a lot of… fine motor skills and concentration. It’s a rather solitary profession, I suppose. I do experience some stiffness in my hands from time to time, but I assumed it was simply due to the nature of my work. I haven’t really consulted a doctor about it, as it’s never been particularly debilitating. I have insurance, of course, a private plan. But I prefer to avoid medical interventions unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, solitary work as an etcher and engraver, some hand stiffness, generally good health otherwise, and a preference for avoiding interventions when possible. That helps me understand your perspective. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A baseline would be prudent, I suppose. Though I confess I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations. But if it's necessary, then I will cooperate. Please, proceed at your convenience. I will remain as still as possible. Though, if I fidget, please do forgive me. It’s a nervous habit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann. No need to apologize at all. We’ll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I notice some slight swelling in your knuckles and some decreased range of motion. Any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Yes… there is a discomfort, particularly when I grip things tightly. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. It tends to worsen at the end of the day, after prolonged work. I usually just try to rest them. I haven’t used any creams or taken any medication for it. I assumed it was simply a consequence of the profession. It’s never been severe enough to warrant a visit to a specialist, I suppose. It feels… like the joints are stiffening, becoming less flexible. It’s a rather unsettling sensation. Though, I’m hardly an expert.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Ache with gripping, worsens at the end of the day, no creams or medication used. Stiffness and decreased flexibility. There’s some tenderness to the touch around the knuckles. It’s possible this is early signs of osteoarthritis, which is common with repetitive hand movements. It’s not a definitive diagnosis without further testing, but it’s something we should consider. Given your history and the exam findings, I’d recommend an X-ray of your hands to get a clearer picture of the joint spaces. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, I suppose that would be… sensible. If it provides a clearer understanding of the situation, then I am agreeable. Though, I confess I’m not particularly fond of radiation exposure. But if it’s deemed necessary by a medical professional, then I will comply. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Is it a lengthy procedure? And will it involve any discomfort? I do have a rather low tolerance for pain, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: It's a very quick procedure, Evann, and the radiation exposure is minimal – comparable to a cross-country flight. You’ll simply stand or sit while the technician takes a few images. There’s no discomfort involved at all – you won’t feel anything. I’ll write an order for the X-ray now. You can go to the radiology department right across the hall, and they’ll take care of you. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. While we’re waiting for the X-ray results, we should also talk about that advance care planning. Would you like to discuss Advance Directives and POLST forms now, or would you prefer to focus on the hand issue for today?
PATIENT: The hand issue is… concerning, naturally. But I believe it would be prudent to address the advance care planning as well. If something were to… happen, I would prefer to have my wishes clearly documented. Though, I confess I find the entire prospect rather… daunting. I don’t relish the thought of discussing my mortality. But I suppose it’s a necessary evil. Perhaps you could explain the difference between the two forms, and then we can decide which one is more appropriate for my situation? I’m afraid my memory is… unreliable, so I may require repeated explanations. Please, forgive my shortcomings.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. It is daunting, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. I'm happy to explain everything as many times as needed, and we'll go at your pace. So, an Advance Directive is a broader document that outlines your overall wishes for medical care – things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment if you're unable to communicate, what kind of pain management you prefer, and who you want to make decisions on your behalf. It covers a wide range of scenarios. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific form. It’s typically used for people with serious illnesses or frailty. It translates your wishes into specific medical orders – things like "Do Not Resuscitate" or "Comfort Measures Only." It's a more concrete set of instructions for your healthcare team. Given your general good health, an Advance Directive would likely be the more appropriate option for you right now. It allows you to think through your wishes without being in an immediate crisis situation. We can document who you want to be your healthcare proxy – the person who would make decisions for you if you're unable to – and what your overall values are. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that clarifies things somewhat. An Advance Directive is broader, for general planning, while a POLST is more specific for serious illness. Given my current health, an Advance Directive is the more sensible option. The… healthcare proxy. That is a point of concern. I am divorced, and I haven’t maintained close contact with my family. I don’t have any particularly close friends either, I’m afraid. It’s a solitary existence, you see. Who… who would I designate as my proxy? I haven't given that much thought, to be honest. It’s a rather unsettling prospect, entrusting such important decisions to someone else. And I'm not certain I have anyone suitable. Would it be possible to… designate a lawyer? Or perhaps the clinic itself could act as my proxy, in the event of an emergency? I understand that may not be standard procedure, but I am at a loss.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Evann, and you’re not alone in that situation. It’s perfectly alright to feel unsure about who to designate. You can designate almost anyone you trust to make healthcare decisions for you, as long as they are over 18 and not your healthcare provider. It doesn’t have to be a family member. It can be a friend, a colleague, or even a lawyer, although a lawyer might not be the best choice as they aren’t familiar with your personal values and wishes. The clinic itself cannot act as your proxy, unfortunately, as that would create a conflict of interest. However, we can document your wishes very thoroughly and share them with anyone you designate. Perhaps you have a long-time friend, even if you don’t see them often?
PATIENT: A long-time friend… no. I've… drifted apart from most people over the years. My work consumes much of my time, and I tend to isolate myself. I’m afraid I don’t have anyone who I would feel comfortable entrusting with such important decisions. Perhaps… there is a colleague, Mr. Ito. He's a fellow engraver, and we occasionally collaborate on projects. He's a quiet man, very reliable, and he's always been respectful. I haven't known him for very long, perhaps a few years, but he seems… trustworthy. Would that be sufficient? I don't know him intimately, and I'm hesitant to burden him with such a responsibility. But he's the only person who comes to mind. I would prefer to avoid involving strangers, if possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ito sounds like a reasonable option, Evann. It's good that you feel he's reliable and respectful. It doesn't require a close personal relationship, as long as he's willing to honor your wishes. We’ll need his contact information, and we’ll send him a form explaining his role and responsibilities. He’ll need to sign it to acknowledge that he’s willing to be your healthcare proxy. Once we have that, we can start documenting your wishes for medical care. We'll go through a series of questions to understand what's important to you – things like your values, your beliefs about end-of-life care, and what kind of treatment you would want in different scenarios. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds manageable. Mr. Ito’s contact information is… 555-123-4567. His email address is ito.engraving@email.com. He works at the Artisan’s Guild downtown. Documenting my wishes… I confess I haven’t given much thought to end-of-life care. It’s a rather morbid topic. But I understand it’s important to have a plan. I suppose I would prefer… comfort. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no hope of recovery. And I would prefer to avoid prolonged suffering. I suppose that’s a rather vague answer, but I’m not certain what else to say. It’s a difficult topic. Perhaps you can guide me through the questions. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That’s perfectly alright. Many people haven’t thought about these questions, and it’s my job to guide you through them. You’ve already expressed a desire for comfort and avoiding prolonged suffering, which is a good starting point. Okay, I’m noting Mr. Ito’s contact information. I’ll send him the paperwork. Let’s start with a more general question. What are some things that are most important to you in life?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. I’ve always found solace in my work. The precision, the detail, the artistry… it’s a form of meditation, you see. Creating something beautiful, something lasting… that’s important to me. I suppose… independence is also important. I prefer to be self-sufficient, to rely on myself. I don’t enjoy being a burden to others. And… perhaps a sense of peace. I’ve always sought tranquility, a quiet existence. Though, I haven’t always found it. I suppose those are my… values. Creating, independence, and peace. Does that answer your question, Doctor? It’s difficult to articulate, to put such abstract concepts into words.
DOCTOR: That’s a beautiful answer, Evann. Creating, independence, and peace – those are very meaningful values. And you articulated them perfectly. Okay, I’m noting those values. We’ll use those as a foundation when we discuss your wishes for medical care. Now, let's think about a specific scenario. Imagine you were seriously ill, unable to communicate, and there was no reasonable hope of recovery. Would you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, to prolong your life?
PATIENT: A ventilator… a feeding tube… No. I don’t believe so. I would prefer… natural death, if that’s not too indelicate a term. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no hope of recovery. It wouldn’t be living, you see. It would be… existing. I would rather focus on comfort, on pain management. I don’t want to be a burden to others, to prolong their suffering as well. I understand it’s a difficult question, but I’m certain of my wishes. I don’t want life-sustaining treatment in that scenario. I would prefer to… let nature take its course. Does that make sense, Doctor? It’s difficult to talk about, but it’s important to be clear, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Evann. You’ve thought about this carefully, and you’re expressing very clear wishes. It's incredibly important to be clear, and you are doing a wonderful job. Okay, I’m documenting your wish to forgo life-sustaining treatment if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. We’ll also document your preference for comfort care and pain management. Now, let's talk about pain management. If you were experiencing severe pain, what level of pain relief would you want?
PATIENT: Severe pain… I would want… as much relief as possible, naturally. I have a rather low tolerance for pain, I’m afraid. I would prefer to be comfortable, not suffering. I understand there are different options, different medications… I would trust your judgment, Doctor. I would prefer to avoid prolonged suffering, even if it means… hastening the inevitable, if that’s not too indelicate a term. I would want sufficient pain relief to be comfortable, to avoid prolonged suffering. I trust your expertise in managing the pain. I don’t want to be… incapacitated, if possible, but I would prioritize comfort. Does that make sense, Doctor? It’s difficult to articulate, to explain such abstract concepts. It's a rather unpleasant subject.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Evann. You want sufficient pain relief to be comfortable, prioritizing comfort and avoiding prolonged suffering, while also being as alert as possible. You are expressing your wishes very clearly. Okay, I'm documenting your preference for adequate pain management, prioritizing comfort, with a desire to remain as alert as possible. We've covered a lot today. Is there anything else you'd like to add, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No… I believe that covers most of it. I’m rather exhausted, to be honest. It’s been a… draining conversation. I suppose I’m grateful for your guidance, Doctor. It’s a… relief to have these things documented, to have a plan in place. Though, I sincerely hope I never have to use it. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. And thank you for… listening. I appreciate it. Perhaps I should schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the X-ray results? And to ensure everything is documented correctly?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I understand it’s been a draining conversation, and you handled it beautifully. It’s good that you feel a sense of relief now, and I’m glad I could help. Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the X-ray results and review everything we’ve documented today. I’ll have my assistant come in and set that up for you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We've covered a lot today, and you’ve done a wonderful job expressing your wishes. For now, let's focus on getting your follow-up appointment scheduled and getting you home to rest. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. Perhaps I’ll see you next week? Or whenever the X-ray results are available? I’m not particularly good with dates, I’m afraid. Thank you again, Doctor. I’m grateful for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. My assistant will contact you with the date and time for your follow-up appointment once the X-ray results are available. Don't worry about the dates—we'll handle that for you. For now, just focus on resting. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor.
