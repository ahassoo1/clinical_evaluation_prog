DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay if I sit? My back... sometimes hurts to stand for long. My husband, he make appointment for me. For… the place? The senior place? I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, do sit. And you are quite correct, your husband scheduled an appointment for you regarding a consultation for assisted living facilities. Though, frankly, I wish more patients came with a clearer understanding of their reason for being here. Now, can you tell me a bit more about why you are considering these facilities?
PATIENT: Oh. Assisted… yes. Is because… I get old, you know? My son, he say is better. I live with my husband, always. Long time. But sometimes… I forget things. Small things. Like names. And… I trip. Fall sometimes. Not bad falls, but… he worry. My husband. He want me safe. Is okay with me. I think. Maybe.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily concerns about memory and balance, prompting discussion about assisted living. And your son is the one initiating this conversation, it seems. Can you elaborate on these memory issues?
PATIENT: Yes, my son, Mateo, he very good boy. Always thinking for me. The memory… is not big things. I remember my husband, I remember Mateo, I remember how to cook my special beans. But… I go to the store, I forget what I need. Or I start to tell a story, and the name… the name of the person I’m talking about… it just… gone. And sometimes… I put things in a place… and I cannot find them. Little things. Not like… not like sick forgetfulness. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're describing what many people experience as they age – some normal cognitive changes. But it's prudent to investigate further. Now, about these instances of tripping and falling… How frequently has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not… every day. Maybe… one time a month? Two months? Sometimes, I just… lose my footing. The rug, maybe. Or… I don't know. I feel… dizzy sometimes, just before. Not a bad dizzy. Like… the room move a little. My husband, he say I need to be careful. He worry about my hip. I break it one time, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, approximately once or twice a month, you experience a loss of balance, sometimes preceded by mild dizziness, and your husband is concerned given your prior hip fracture. Do you experience any pain in your hip currently?
PATIENT: No, no pain now. Not bad pain. Sometimes, when is cold… a little ache. But I take something for it. The doctor give me something last year. I forget the name… a little white pill. Is okay. Not much pain. Is the falling he worry about. He say… if I fall again… is bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll address the fall risk. Now, let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… The doctor, he say my pressure… sometimes is high. But I take a pill for that too. A little blue one. And… I had something with my stomach, long time ago. But they fix it. They… cut it out. Long time ago. No problems now. I think. I forget. Is hard to remember… all the things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a history of hypertension – managed with medication – and a prior abdominal surgery. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pills for your blood pressure and, as you mentioned, the one for your stomach?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. The… the bone pill! The doctor give me that after I break my hip. For… for my bones. Make them strong. A white one, I think. And… sometimes, when my feet hurt, I take something for that. But not every day. Only when they really hurt. Is a yellow one. I think. So many pills! I have a bag… you want to see the bag?
DOCTOR: No, that's quite alright, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. We can review the specifics of your medications later. For now, let's stick to a general overview. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any. I eat everything. Except… sometimes spicy food makes my stomach upset. But that is not allergy. Just… upset. No allergy to anything. I sleep good. I don't have trouble breathing. I just… old. And forgetful. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I need to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – experienced memory problems, neurological conditions, or frequent falls?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she forgetful too. When she get very old. But she live long time. And my father… he strong. Never sick. And my brother… he okay. Mateo, my son… he never sick either. I think… nobody have problems with falling. Except me, maybe. Is just me, I think. Old age. Is what my husband say.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. AbdoLLAHI, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as assessing your balance, gait, and neurological function. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination. I’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is okay. Just… please be gentle. My arm sometimes… feels funny. And… don't mind if I hold your hand? Sometimes I get nervous. Is okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. That is perfectly acceptable. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Please, walk slowly across the room and back. I’m observing your balance and coordination.
PATIENT: Is okay? I try to walk slow. My legs… they feel heavy sometimes. And the floor… is slippery. I think. Is hard to tell. I need my glasses to see good. Maybe is the floor. Is okay? Is slow, but… I make it.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is common at your age. And your hand strength appears adequate. Now, I'm going to check your balance with a simple Romberg test. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes for 30 seconds.
PATIENT: Oh dear! I… I don't like this. I feel… dizzy. And I… I might fall. Maybe I should sit down? Is okay. Just… not good with eyes closed. Is scary. Can I sit now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. Please, sit down. It's quite alright. Based on your self-reported symptoms, the physical examination findings – slightly unsteady gait, diminished reflexes, and difficulty with balance – and the medication list we've compiled, my preliminary assessment suggests possible age-related balance issues, contributing to your falls and memory concerns. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies – particularly B12 and D – and thyroid problems, as these can sometimes mimic your symptoms. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your neurological function and memory. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Is that… bad? Is something wrong with my brain? I don’t want anything wrong with my brain! I just… forget things. Small things. I don’t want… tests. Is okay with the blood. Blood is okay. But… the neurologist? What will they do? I just want to be safe. And… not fall. That is all. Is okay with the blood, but… tell me about the neurologist, please, Doctor. Is scary.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. AbdoLLAHI, a referral to a neurologist is not necessarily indicative of something being seriously wrong. It simply means a specialist will perform a more thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your balance and memory concerns. They will likely ask you detailed questions about your history, conduct cognitive tests – simple quizzes to assess your memory and thinking skills – and may order imaging studies, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Think of it as gathering more information to create a clear picture. It’s a preventative measure. The results will help us determine the best course of action. For now, I'm prescribing a Vitamin D supplement, as deficiency is common and can contribute to weakness and falls. I'll also provide a referral to physical therapy for balance exercises to improve your stability. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to review the blood work results and discuss the neurologist appointment. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No. I think… too much. So many things. Blood, and neurologist, and… exercises. And I forget everything already! Is okay. Just… thank you, Doctor. For trying. And… can I have a little help with the appointment? I… I don't know how to make appointments. Is too hard. My husband usually do it. But he busy now. Is okay. Just… help me. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. My nurse will assist you in scheduling both the blood work and the neurologist appointment. Please ensure Ms. AbdoLLAHI has all the necessary information and assistance with transportation if needed. And… follow up with her to ensure she understands the post-appointment instructions. We'll get this sorted, Ms. AbdoLLAHI. Remember to take the Vitamin D supplement as directed, and please contact the office if you experience any concerning symptoms. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
