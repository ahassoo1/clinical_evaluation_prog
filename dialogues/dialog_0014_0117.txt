DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… my cough. It ain’t been good. Been coughin’ up… stuff. Red stuff. Sorry, don't remember much else right now. Been smokin’ a long time, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. A cough, with some…red coloration to the mucus. And you mentioned a long smoking history. Okay. How long exactly have you been smoking, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Long time… real long. Since I was… young. Maybe forty years? Somethin’ like that. I don't keep track of dates so good. It's always been a pack a day, I think. Or close to it. I just… smoke. Don't remember when I started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Forty years… a pack a day. Alright. And this cough… when did this start?
PATIENT: This cough… …a few weeks, maybe? It started kinda normal, just a smoker's cough. But then the… red stuff showed up. Maybe a month now? Time gets away from me. It's been gettin’ worse, though. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: A month, getting worse… and you’re experiencing some…red-tinged mucus. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… … I get tired easier, I guess. Real tired. And… kinda short of breath when I walk. Not all the time, just when I push myself. I ain’t been feelin’ too strong lately, but… old age, maybe? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and shortness of breath… Okay. Any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I noticed. Chills… sometimes, but it gets cold here, you know? And weight… …I ain't been weighin' myself. Maybe lost a little, but I ain’t been eatin' much either. Hard to get hungry when you feel… like this. I don’t really keep track of those things. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we’ll get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Just… try to be quick, alright? I got things to do. This cough… it's worryin’ me, but I ain't got time for a long visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. Deep breath in… and out… good. Again… in… and out… Your breathing sounds a bit wheezy, and there’s some diminished sound in the lower lobes. Oxygen saturation is 91%. That’s a little low. Any chest pain at all, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Chest pain… … Not really pain, exactly. But a kinda… tightness. When I cough real hard, sometimes. Like somethin’s squeezin’ my chest. It don't last long, just a few seconds. It’s not bad enough to go to the hospital, though. Not yet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your smoking history, the cough, the red-tinged mucus, the shortness of breath, and now the tightness in your chest… I'm concerned about the possibility of something serious. We need to get a chest X-ray to take a look at your lungs. I'm also going to order some blood work to check for infection and other issues. I'm going to be frank with you, Mr. Reyno, this isn't something we can ignore. It could be bronchitis, pneumonia, or…something else. We need to rule things out.
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood work? Look, Doc, I appreciate it, but I ain't got insurance except for Medicare. Is all this gonna cost a lot of money? I don't wanna get stuck with a big bill. And I really don't have time for a lot of tests. Just tell me if it's bad. Tell me straight. Can't we just get me somethin' for the cough?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand your concerns about cost and time. Medicare should cover the X-ray and blood work, but we can definitely check with billing to confirm that before we proceed, and I’ll make sure they bill Medicare first. As for just getting something for the cough… that would be irresponsible without knowing what’s causing the cough. We’re not just treating a symptom; we’re trying to find the root of the problem. If it is something serious, delaying treatment could have serious consequences. I need to get more information to provide you with the best possible care, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to keep the costs as low as possible.
PATIENT: …Alright. Fine. X-ray and blood work. But you gotta promise me you’ll tell me straight. No fancy medical words, just… is it bad? And make ‘em hurry. I got things to do, remember? Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. I promise I’ll explain everything clearly. I'll get the orders sent to radiology and the lab right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. As for the X-ray, the radiology department is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule it as soon as possible. It shouldn’t take too long. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help manage the symptoms, but remember, this is just temporary until we get the results back. Please let me know if you experience any side effects. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as we can.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks, I guess. Just… let me know when I gotta go get poked and prodded.
