DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like it's... flapping. Not always, but it happens. It's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, "funny," like flapping… I understand. And it's not constant, just happens sometimes?
PATIENT: No, not all the time. Maybe… two, three times a week? Sometimes not for a few days. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels weird. Like a fish, maybe? When it’s flapping in the water. It stops after a little bit, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few times a week, and it stops on its own after a bit. And you described it like a fish flapping – that gives me a good idea. Is it related to anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I’ve been trying to think. Sometimes when I’m working, maybe? I work with… machines, big machines. Chemical stuff. But it also happens when I’m just… sitting, watching TV with my wife. So I don't know. It doesn't seem to be anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem to be consistently linked to work or activity. That's helpful. When you feel this “flapping,” do you notice any other symptoms at the same time?
PATIENT: Other things? Let me think... Sometimes I feel a little… out of breath, maybe? Not really short of breath, just… like I need to take a bigger breath. And sometimes I feel… tired. But I always feel a little tired, if that makes sense. It's hard to say if it's from the heart or… just life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be hard to pinpoint things when you're feeling generally tired. So, a little shortness of breath sometimes, and that tiredness... You mentioned the feeling comes and goes. How long does each episode usually last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe… thirty seconds? A minute, the longest? It starts, and then it stops. Like a switch. It’s not scary, just… annoying. I don’t want it to happen when I’m at work, you know? It makes me worry about… things.
DOCTOR: Okay, thirty seconds to a minute, then it just stops. That’s good information. And it's understandable to be concerned about it happening at work. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if we can hear or feel anything unusual. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t like feeling… unsure.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfectly understandable. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart rate is a little fast, actually. I'm hearing a regular rhythm, but it's quicker than I'd expect. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not critically high. Your lungs sound clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Pulse is also a little strong. Now, I'd like to order an EKG, just to get a more detailed look at your heart's electrical activity. We should also do some blood work to check your thyroid levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… EKG and blood work. Sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is it something I should worry about a lot? I don’t like tests, if I’m being honest. I don't like doctors much, either, but I came here, so… what’s an EKG? And what will the blood work show? Just… tell me what to expect.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Puder. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. Let me explain. An EKG – it's a simple, painless test. We'll attach some small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs, and it records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all, and takes just a few minutes. As for the blood work, we'll be looking at a few different things. Checking your thyroid levels is important because thyroid problems can sometimes cause similar symptoms to heart issues. We’ll also check your electrolytes and other basic markers. It's mostly to rule things out, to help us figure out what's going on. I don’t want you to worry unnecessarily. We're doing these tests to be thorough, and to get a better understanding of what might be causing your “flapping” feeling. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s best to investigate. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and blood. Yes, I understand. So, not necessarily serious. That's good. I guess stickers and blood are okay. My wife, she always says I worry too much. You think it could be my… thyroid? I’ve been feeling tired a lot lately, like you said. And sometimes I get… hot for no reason. It's weird. But the flapping, that’s the main thing. I don't want it to happen when I'm working with the chemicals. That scares me.
DOCTOR: It could be your thyroid, yes. The fatigue and hot flashes you're describing are consistent with that, along with the heart palpitations. And your concern about it happening at work is completely valid, especially given the nature of your job. We need to rule out any underlying heart conditions first, of course, which is why the EKG is important. We'll get the EKG done right away, and I'll send the blood work order to the lab. You can have that done at the clinic, or at any lab that's convenient for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to tell me, or any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just the tiredness, the hot flashes, and the flapping. I don't want to bother you with too much. I just want to know what's going on. My wife will be glad to hear you're checking my thyroid. She says I need to take better care of myself. I guess she’s right. Okay, stickers first then? Where do they go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. And you’re not bothering me at all, Mr. Puder. That’s what I’m here for. I’ll just need you to lie back on the examination table again. The stickers – they're small, and we’ll place them on your chest, arms, and legs. It’s a quick and painless procedure, and the technician will explain everything as they go. I’ll have them come in right away. Do you have any allergies to adhesives or bandages that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Just… I don’t like needles much. But stickers are okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It makes me feel… less worried. I'll just… lie down then? Where is the table? Is it cold? I get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. No needles today, just stickers. And you're very welcome, Mr. Puder. It’s my job to make you feel comfortable. The examination table is right over here. And no, it's not cold, it has a warm covering. We can also provide a blanket if you’d like. Shall we get started with the EKG then?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s do it. The stickers first, please. And… maybe the blanket? Just in case. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me get the technician in here with the EKG equipment and the blanket. Just lie back and try to relax as much as possible. Maria, could you please come in here with the EKG machine and a blanket for Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m lying down. I’ll try to relax. It’s hard when you’re worried, but I’ll try. My wife says I overthink things. She's probably right. Just… stickers and then blood, right? And hopefully, it's not too bad. I'm ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Puder. You're doing great. Maria will explain the process, and it shouldn’t take long at all. She’s very gentle and experienced. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just try to relax, and let Maria do her work.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will try.
