DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… embarrassing. I’ve been to the doctor about this already, twice, and they just keep giving me pills that don’t do anything. It’s… well, it’s the runs. Non-stop. And it’s been going on for weeks. It's just… awful.
DOCTOR: “The runs,” you say. Right. And these other doctors… what did they tell you it was?
PATIENT: Ugh, they mumbled something about “viral” and “stomach bug.” Honestly, I don’t even remember exactly. It was all doctor-speak. They just kept saying it would “run its course.” Well, it is running a course, straight to the bathroom, if you get my meaning. And it's not getting better. It’s just… inconvenient, frankly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Well, “viral” and “stomach bug” are… remarkably vague. And frankly, if it's lasting weeks, those aren’t terribly helpful diagnoses. Let's try to get a clearer picture. So, tell me, is it just the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, it’s not just that. I’m tired. Really tired. And I’ve been cramping, a lot. Like, doubled-over cramping. And… well, I haven’t been eating much because every time I try, it just… goes right through me. I’ve lost weight, I think. Though, honestly, maybe that’s a good thing. I was getting a little thick around the middle. But still. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, cramping, weight loss… and you're not eating because of the… urgency. Okay. And the diarrhea itself… how frequent are we talking?
PATIENT: Frequent? Ugh. All the time. Like, I can barely leave the house. I wake up in the middle of the night. I can’t go anywhere without… well, you get the picture. It's just constant worry, honestly. I’ve tried everything. Pepto, Imodium, charcoal… nothing works. I’m starting to think I’m just… cursed. Or something.
DOCTOR: “Cursed” is… not a medical term we use, Ms. Woodring. But I understand your frustration. And self-treating with over-the-counter medications… that can sometimes mask the underlying problem and make it harder to figure out. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Not that I’ve seen. Look, I’m not staring at everything that goes down the toilet, okay? I just know it's… watery. And it smells awful. Really awful. And sometimes there's… things in it. Undigested things. It’s… gross. I don’t want to talk about it anymore, frankly. I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to go into graphic detail. Undigested food… that is concerning. And the persistent nature of this, despite previous treatments… Frankly, a simple “viral” explanation isn’t cutting it. We need to run some tests. I’d like to order a stool sample – a comprehensive one – to rule out any parasites or bacterial infections. And I think a blood test is in order to check for inflammation and rule out anything more serious. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, I've already given so many samples. But… fine. Whatever. As long as it gets me closer to feeling normal. I just… I have a life, you know? I don't have time for all this. So, yes. Tests. Just… tell me where to go and what to do. And how long it’s going to take.
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll get this sorted. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll give you the container and instructions. It’s a fairly straightforward collection, but follow the directions carefully. The blood test will be done right here in the office; I’ll have my nurse draw it after we finish talking. Results usually take 3-5 business days. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, even if you’re not eating much. And avoid dairy, fatty foods, and anything with a lot of sugar. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable? I suppose. It’s just… more restrictions. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m living on air. But fine, no dairy, no fat, no sugar. Got it. Just… let's get this over with. Is there anything else? Because I really don't want to be here any longer than I have to be.
DOCTOR: Just the blood draw, then. My nurse will be in shortly. While we wait, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh, when I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. A long time ago. And… I had a C-section when I had my daughter. That was… traumatic. That's about it. Nothing else. Honestly, I try not to dwell on medical stuff. It doesn't usually end well.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and C-section. Alright. And any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone else. And… my husband, he passed away last year. But that wasn’t a… medical condition, exactly. Just… awful. I've been generally healthy up until this. This… this is new. And frankly, it's stressing me out more than anything. It's just… constant worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband… that’s a significant loss. And stress can certainly exacerbate… physical symptoms. It’s good you’re seeking help. Now, about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her heart, but I don’t remember the details. We weren’t close. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of that sort of thing. It doesn’t change anything. I’m just… me. Dealing with this. And frankly, I'd rather not talk about the past. It’s not helping. Is the nurse here yet? I really need to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to delve into family history further. My nurse, Sarah, should be here any moment. She’ll take care of the blood draw and explain the next steps. Just try to relax. And, Ms. Woodring, I want to assure you we will get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up. This whole thing is just… exhausting. And honestly, I have things to do. Real things. Not… sitting around worrying about my insides. .
