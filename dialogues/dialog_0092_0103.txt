DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back. It’s been hurting. Low down, you know? Not good. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a couple months. Feels…old, if that makes sense. Like it's just wearing out.
DOCTOR: I see. A couple of months of lower back pain. And you describe it as feeling “old,” like it’s wearing out. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, like…when I bend over, it just aches. Not sharp, not sudden. Just…a dull ache. And it gets worse if I stand for too long. I used to be able to garden all day, but now…not so much. Maybe ten minutes and I need to sit. I don't know what happened. I didn't do anything. Just…old, I guess. I’m 77, you know. Things break.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it's a dull ache in your lower back, worsened by bending and prolonged standing. It’s gradually gotten worse over a couple of months, and it’s impacting your ability to garden. That's certainly frustrating. And you haven’t had any specific injury that you recall?
PATIENT: No, no injury. Nothing I remember, anyway. Just…slow. Like a rusty hinge, you know? Everything just…stiffens up. And it’s not just my back, Doctor. I feel…brittle, all over. My bones just don’t feel as strong as they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a gradual onset of lower back pain accompanied by a general feeling of stiffness and reduced strength. We'll definitely want to investigate this further. Before we proceed with a physical exam, let's go over a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with pills. Stopped taking those a few years back, he said I was good. And…arthritis in my hands, maybe ten years ago? Nothing major, just a little soreness. Oh! And my wife, God rest her soul, she always said I should get my bones checked. Said her mother had something with her bones…weak bones? I can’t remember the name. It wasn't the strong kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had a history of high blood pressure that is currently well-controlled without medication, and some arthritis in your hands. And your wife mentioned a family history of a bone condition – something causing weak bones. Do you recall anything else about that condition?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. She just said her mother broke things easily. A hip, I think? And something about needing to be careful. She worried a lot, my wife. Bless her heart. I mostly just remember her telling me I should get checked, but I kept putting it off. I was busy with work, you know? Fundraising. Always something to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to put things off. We can certainly look into that family history further. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pills you stopped taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just a little something for my waterworks sometimes, but that's over the counter. Nothing a doctor prescribed. Just…helps me sleep at night, that's all. Nothing for pain, though. I try to avoid pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Mr. Vankampen. I just mean things like do you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any hobbies or activities you enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay. Well, I used to smoke, a long time ago. Stopped about thirty years ago. Best thing I ever did. As for drinking…a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not much, though. And hobbies…I used to love gardening, like I said. And I did a lot of fundraising work for the church. That was my main thing. Still do a little, but not like I used to. It’s hard on my back, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve quit smoking thirty years ago, you have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, and you enjoy gardening and fundraising. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your back, your range of motion, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, alright? It’s a little sore.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, I’m going to start by feeling along your spine. Can you tell me if any of this is particularly tender?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right…there. And a little bit…all along here. Not sharp, just…aches when you push on it. It feels…swollen, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting tenderness along your lumbar spine, particularly at the spot you indicated. And you feel some swelling there as well. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Could you try bending forward and touching your toes, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Ooh…that’s…difficult. I can’t get very far, Doctor. It hurts too much if I try to go further. It’s just…stiff. Like a rusty door.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting limited range of motion in your lumbar spine, and you experience discomfort with forward bending. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you're experiencing lower back pain likely due to some underlying musculoskeletal issue. Given your age and the feeling of stiffness, and the family history of possible weak bones, I think it’s important to rule out a few things. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a Vitamin D level and a comprehensive metabolic panel, as well as a bone density scan. This will help us determine if there’s any underlying condition contributing to your pain and stiffness. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a…bone density scan? Sounds…serious. But, alright. If you think it's best, Doctor, I trust you. I just want to be able to garden again. Is that going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Vankampen. It’s definitely a valid concern, especially without insurance. I'll see what I can do to find the most affordable options for you. Our billing department can also work with you on a payment plan. The blood tests will give us some initial information, and the bone density scan will help us assess your bone health. It will also let us assess whether or not you have osteoporosis, or thinning of the bones. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend gentle stretching and avoiding any activities that aggravate your pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage the discomfort, but please follow the dosage instructions carefully. We can also discuss some physical therapy options if the pain persists. I’ll have the lab order and the referral for the bone density scan sent to you shortly. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…reasonable. Gentle stretching, no heavy lifting, over-the-counter pills. I can do that. And you'll help me with the cost? That would be a blessing. Osteo…poro…sis? Is that what my wife was talking about? Thin bones? And what about my back right now? Is there anything I can do today to feel a little better? Besides resting, that is.
DOCTOR: Yes, osteoporosis is a condition where your bones become thinner and more fragile, increasing your risk of fractures. It's possible that's what your wife was referring to. As for today, to help ease your immediate discomfort, you can try applying a warm compress or ice pack to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time. Gentle range-of-motion exercises, such as pelvic tilts, can also help loosen up the muscles and reduce stiffness. Avoid any sudden movements or twisting motions, and if you experience any sharp pain, stop immediately. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help with the muscle spasms in your back. It's important to take it as directed, and be aware that it can cause drowsiness, so avoid driving or operating machinery while taking it. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your tests and develop a long-term treatment plan once we have them. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay, warm compress, ice pack, gentle exercises…muscle relaxant…cyclobenzaprine…That's a mouthful. And no driving. Alright. I don't drive much anyway. I think…yes, that sounds alright. I appreciate you helping me, Doctor. It's good to know someone is listening. When will I hear about the tests? A couple of days? A week?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could help. The lab results should be available within 2-3 business days. The bone density scan may take a little longer, perhaps a week, as it requires scheduling and interpretation by a radiologist. Our office will contact you as soon as the results are available to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns. Here's the prescription for the cyclobenzaprine, and a handout with some gentle stretching exercises you can try at home. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Giganti. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. It’s my pleasure. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
