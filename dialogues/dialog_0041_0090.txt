DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the internal medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I’m here for… a check-up before a surgery? It’s regarding some… cosmetic procedures I’m considering. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. It was arranged by my insurance, I think. Would you mind if I explained what I do remember, and perhaps you could help me fill in the gaps?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, please do. Don’t worry about the fuzzy details, we’ll sort it out. It's pretty common for things to get a little mixed up. Just tell me whatever you do remember about why your insurance suggested a check-up, and what kind of procedures you're thinking about. We can work backwards from there. No pressure at all.
PATIENT: Well, my husband… he passed away a little over a year ago. It was… sudden. And afterward, I just… felt very unlike myself. I wanted to feel more… confident, I suppose. More like me again. So, I spoke with a specialist about… some things. Things to help with my face and… body. I recall discussing a lift and… perhaps some contouring? But truthfully, it was all rather overwhelming, and I wasn’t thinking clearly. The insurance company then requested this appointment, to ensure I was healthy enough for everything. I just… want to feel good again, Doctor. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mackenzi. Losing someone is… incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly natural to want to feel like yourself again, and to explore options to help with that. It's good you're taking this step to ensure everything is medically sound before proceeding. So, just to clarify – you’ve already spoken with a cosmetic surgeon about a facelift and contouring?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Dr. Ramirez, in the city. A very… thorough woman. She was quite detailed in her explanations, but, as I said, I was a bit… lost in it all at the time. I believe she sent a summary to my insurance, and then they scheduled this appointment with you? I don’t recall signing any specific authorizations for you to receive details directly, if that matters. I just… showed up today, as instructed. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Mackenzi. It just means we might need to get some information from Dr. Ramirez directly. No worries, we can handle that. It’s standard procedure. Just to get a better picture of things, and to help me understand your overall health before we discuss the procedures themselves, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… Well, I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses or surgeries before this, I don’t believe. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. I did have a bout of… bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up quickly with antibiotics. And I’m a little anemic, generally. My doctor back home used to prescribe iron supplements periodically. Other than that… honestly, I struggle to recall anything significant. I’ve always tried to eat well and stay active, but I haven’t seen a general practitioner regularly since… well, since my husband passed. It just… hasn’t been a priority. Does that help? I apologize for the vagueness. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It's completely understandable. Losing track of things, especially when you're grieving, is very common. Anemia is good to know, and we'll check your iron levels today. Do you currently take any medications or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me see… I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent. And I’ve been taking a daily multivitamin, just a standard one, for… well, I can't recall how long, truthfully. Perhaps a few months? It was Dr. Ramirez’s suggestion, actually, to help prepare for the surgery. Apart from that… no, I don’t think so. I’m not on any regular prescriptions. I truly wish my memory were better. It’s quite embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It’s not something to be embarrassed about. We can work around it. Ibuprofen and a multivitamin are good to know. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother is still living, thankfully, and she's generally healthy, although she has a bit of arthritis in her knees. My father passed away when I was young, from… I believe it was heart disease. He was a smoker for many years. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from diabetes. Apart from that… I don't recall any other significant medical conditions running in the family. My family isn't very forthcoming with medical details, if I'm honest. They tend to avoid discussing such things. It’s not a particularly open family, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. Families are often like that. That's still helpful information, though. It gives us a starting point. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… Well, before my husband… we were very active. We loved hiking and gardening. Now… I still try to garden a bit, it’s very therapeutic, but I don’t do as much as I used to. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don't exercise regularly, I'm afraid. I used to, but… motivation has been difficult. I work outdoors as a landscaper, so I get some physical activity through my job, but it’s not the same as dedicated exercise. I don’t have any pets, and I live alone. It’s… a quiet life now. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mackenzi. It sounds like you had a very active life, and it's understandable that things have changed. Working outdoors is good, and it’s good to hear you’re still finding some enjoyment in gardening. Alright, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your overall condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed. I… I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax, and try to breathe normally. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen is normal. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to stress or anxiety, and we can monitor that. Do you have any specific concerns or areas you’d like me to focus on during the exam?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. I’ve never been one to complain, and I’ve always been relatively healthy. If anything… perhaps you could just check my hands? I’ve noticed a little stiffness lately, especially in the mornings. It might be nothing, just… gardening, I suppose. But it’s been a little more noticeable recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a little tenderness in the joints of your hands, particularly when I flex them. It’s mild, and it could be related to gardening, as you mentioned. But it’s worth noting, and we can keep an eye on it. It doesn't appear to be anything serious at this point, but we may want to consider some blood tests to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions, just to be on the safe side. Now, one last thing. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so, Doctor. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to any medications, as far as I can recall. I’m not allergic to any foods, and I don’t have any known environmental allergies. Actually… there was one time, many years ago, when I had a rash after using a specific hand cream. It was a floral scent, I think. But it was a minor reaction, and it cleared up quickly. I haven't used that cream since. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mackenzi. It could be a sensitivity to a specific ingredient. We'll make a note of that in your file. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be within normal limits, with a few minor things to keep an eye on. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re generally healthy enough to proceed with the cosmetic procedures, but we do need to get some blood work done to rule out any underlying conditions. Would you like me to order some routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If that’s what you recommend, then please do. I trust your judgment. I want to be certain everything is as it should be before… proceeding. I just want to feel good again, Doctor. And I appreciate you taking the time to ensure that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. That's my job. I completely understand. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests. You can have them done at the lab across the hall. They’ll send the results to me within a few days. Once I have those results, we can discuss them, and decide if any further testing is needed. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. You’ve addressed all of my concerns, and I appreciate your patience. Thank you for everything. I'll go to the lab now, and I'll await your call.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s great to hear. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you think of something else. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mackenzi. I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. Have a good day as well. .
