DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing some… well, pressure on my bladder. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… approximately three weeks, I would say. It started gradually, just a slight feeling, but it’s definitely become more noticeable each day. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and persistent. I find myself having to go to the restroom more often, even if I don’t feel like I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, gradually worsening. More frequent urination, even without the urge. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t specifically been looking, if I’m honest. Now that you mention it… perhaps the color is a little darker than usual, but it’s hard to say for certain. I drink a fair amount of water, so it’s generally quite pale. The smell… no, I haven't noticed anything different about the smell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Darker urine could indicate dehydration, even if you're drinking water, or it could be something else. We'll get to the bottom of it. Now, are you experiencing any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain during urination, and no pain after either. It really is just the constant feeling of pressure. It's… unsettling, to be quite frank. It makes it difficult to concentrate on anything for too long, constantly worrying about needing to find a restroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with urination. That’s good. And is this pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. It ebbs and flows, certainly. There are times when it’s more manageable, less noticeable. But it never truly goes away completely. Especially if I’ve been sitting for a while, or if I’ve had a lot to drink. It seems to worsen then. It's just a general, nagging discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this pressure?
PATIENT: No, no fever, no chills. And thankfully, no lower back pain either. It really is isolated to the bladder area, that feeling of… fullness and pressure. It's a little concerning, because I don't recall experiencing anything quite like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m generally quite healthy. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing chronic. I'm married, and thankfully my husband is healthy as well. I do have Medicare, as I mentioned. I had a routine check-up last year, and everything was perfectly normal then. Oh! And I've never been pregnant. I just wanted to add that in case it was relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, routine check-up last year was normal, and never been pregnant. That's helpful. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any. I try to take good care of myself – eat a reasonably healthy diet, get some exercise when I can. It’s just… this pressure is really throwing me off. It’s not something I’ve ever dealt with before, and I’m a little anxious to find out what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some issues with high blood pressure later in life, and my father had type 2 diabetes, but nothing specifically related to the bladder or kidneys that I’m aware of. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. We don’t have a particularly strong medical history, if that makes sense. It’s mostly just the usual aging-related things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history related to the bladder. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And absolutely no recreational drugs, thank you very much. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned. This is quite frustrating, as I can’t think of anything that would be causing this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Now, what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: That’s an easy one! I don’t take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, if I have a headache. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I really try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer to let my body heal itself naturally, if it can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright, Marialena, I think we have a good starting point. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a quick neurological check. Then, I'd like to do a urine sample to rule out an infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for testing, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you’ll just change into a gown, I'll be right back. And please try to collect a midstream urine sample while you're in there. There are instructions in the bathroom. I'll listen to your abdomen first, then we can move on to the neurological exam.
PATIENT: Certainly. A midstream sample, understood. Thank you for explaining. I’ll go and change now. Please let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses. I don't hear any unusual sounds. Now I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, do you have the urine sample ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I followed the instructions carefully, I believe. I tried to catch a midstream sample as you explained. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Perfect, thank you. I’m going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. It'll take about fifteen minutes to get the results back. While we wait, let's talk a little bit more about your symptoms. You mentioned the pressure is constant, but does anything specifically worsen it – like caffeine, alcohol, or certain foods?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Now that you mention it, I do feel a little more pressure after drinking coffee, but I only have one cup in the morning, so I hadn’t thought much of it. And yes, I believe alcohol does make it a little worse as well, but that’s not surprising, given that it's a diuretic. I haven’t noticed anything specific in terms of food, no. I generally have a fairly balanced diet, so I don’t think that’s the culprit.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and alcohol seem to exacerbate it. While we wait for the results, have you experienced any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain in my back or sides at all. As I mentioned earlier, the discomfort is really localized to the bladder area - just that constant feeling of fullness and pressure. It's just... unsettling, because I've never experienced anything like this before. I try to stay positive, but it's hard not to worry when you don't know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab results are back. The urinalysis shows no sign of infection. Your white blood cell count is normal, and there’s no bacteria present. That’s good news. However, there is a small amount of blood in your urine – microscopic hematuria. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood? That doesn’t sound good. What could that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I… I must admit, I’m a little concerned now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking questions, Marialena. It's important to be informed. Microscopic hematuria can have a number of causes, most of which are benign. It could be caused by strenuous exercise, a recent urinary tract infection that didn't cause overt symptoms, or even just irritation of the bladder. However, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. To be on the safe side, I'd like to schedule a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It'll give us a more detailed look at your kidneys, bladder, and surrounding structures. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you recommend, Doctor, then yes, absolutely. I’d rather be cautious and rule out anything serious, of course. When would that be scheduled? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll have my assistant schedule you for a CT scan next week. You’ll need to drink a contrast dye before the scan, so you'll be given instructions on how to prepare. It's important to stay well-hydrated beforehand. In the meantime, I'd like you to keep a bladder diary – track how often you urinate, the amount of fluid you're drinking, and any symptoms you experience. And I also recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water a day. We’ll review the results of the CT scan when they're available and discuss the next steps then. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A bladder diary… yes, I can do that. Eight glasses of water, understood. Hmm… actually, yes, I do have one question. You said most causes are benign, but what are the more serious possibilities you’re ruling out? I don’t mean to be difficult, but I like to be prepared, and knowing what we’re looking for might help me feel a little less anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Marialena. I appreciate you asking. The more serious possibilities – and I want to stress that these are less common – include kidney stones, a urinary tract obstruction, or, very rarely, bladder or kidney cancer. However, given your age and the absence of other concerning symptoms like flank pain or significant weight loss, those are less likely. The CT scan will help us get a clear picture of what’s going on and determine the cause of the microscopic hematuria. It’s important to remember that a hematuria itself does not automatically mean cancer or any serious condition. But to rule everything out, we must investigate and provide answers. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Kidney stones, obstruction, cancer… it's a little frightening to hear, but I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. I understand the need for investigation and ruling things out. I’ll keep the bladder diary, drink plenty of water, and schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. My assistant will be in shortly to review the discharge instructions and schedule your CT scan. She’ll also give you a copy of the bladder diary. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. It's important to address these matters promptly. I’ll see you then, Marialena. And remember, most likely, this will be something simple. We’re just being thorough. Please get dressed, and I’ll step out to allow you some privacy.
