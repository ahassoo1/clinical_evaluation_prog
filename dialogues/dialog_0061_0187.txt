DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just…chest pain. And my heart…feels funny. Like it’s racing. Blood pressure too high, they said at the…place. Just want to get this over with, quickly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain and a racing heart, and you were told your blood pressure was high. I understand you’d like to get this sorted out quickly, and we’ll do our best. To start, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More…what more is there to tell? It hurts. Here. <points to center of chest> Sometimes feels tight. Been happening…a few days now. Not all the time, thankfully. Waste of time to sit here describing every little thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. Even “little things” can be important. A few days of chest pain that comes and goes… okay. When it hurts, does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Walking, maybe. Going up the stairs definitely. Sitting down helps. And…thinking about it makes it worse! Look, I’m a busy man. What’s going to happen? Are you going to poke me with needles? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with activity like walking and stairs, and better when you're resting. And you're understandably worried about needles. We'll try to minimize that as much as possible. Before we talk about what might be happening, I need to ask some questions to get a better idea of what’s going on. It's important to rule things out. Have you ever had chest pain like this before?
PATIENT: No! Never. This is new. Always been healthy. Work hard, eat…okay. Never had problems like this. Don't understand why now, after so long, suddenly problems. <shakes head> Waste of time, this.
DOCTOR: Okay, new chest pain, and you've generally been healthy. That's good information. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Symptoms…other than the pain? Let me think. <pauses, tapping a finger on his knee> Sometimes I feel…winded. Like I can't catch my breath, even when not doing anything. And…my ankles have been a little puffy. Is that a symptom? Honestly, I just want to know if I'm going to die from this. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath and some swelling in your ankles. Those can be related. It's good you mentioned those. And I understand your concern about whether it's serious. Let’s take a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Don't take too long. I have appointments. And be gentle with the ankles, please. They are sensitive. <folds arms across his chest, looking impatient>
DOCTOR: <stage>Dr. Kimm gently auscultates Mr. Sobkowicz’s heart and lungs with a stethoscope, then carefully palpates his ankles, noting slight pitting edema bilaterally. She maintains eye contact with Mr. Sobkowicz throughout.> Okay, I’m listening now. Your heart sounds a little…fast, as you mentioned, and I did hear a slight extra sound. Your lungs sound clear. And yes, I do feel some swelling in your ankles, as you pointed out. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me. <stage>Dr. Kimm takes Mr. Sobkowicz’s blood pressure and pulse. BP: 160/95, Pulse: 98 bpm> Your blood pressure is a bit high, and your pulse is also elevated. This is consistent with what you were told previously. Given your age, and these symptoms – the chest pain, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling – we need to investigate a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Investigate? What possibilities? Is it my heart? I knew it! I just knew something was wrong. What are you going to do? Give me a bunch of pills? I don't want pills. I want a quick answer, and I want to go home. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s unsettling to feel something is wrong, and you want answers quickly. We’ll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. Several things could be causing these symptoms. It could be a heart problem, and that’s why we need to investigate. Things like high blood pressure over time can strain the heart. It could also be something else, like fluid buildup. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to see your lungs and heart size, and some blood work to check your kidney function and look for markers that might suggest heart strain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests! <sighs heavily> Fine. Whatever. Just…do them quickly. I have a golf game Saturday. I do not want these tests to interfere with my golf game. And who is going to pay for all this? Private insurance. That’s what I have. Is that enough? This is a waste of my precious time.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll get these tests ordered right away. I’ll make sure the request goes in quickly. We’ll do our best to minimize any disruption to your weekend. And yes, your private insurance should cover these tests – I’ll have the billing department confirm everything. While we're waiting for the results, let's go over a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Never! Healthy as a horse, I tell you. Always been. Work hard, eat…normal. Maybe a little too much salt sometimes. But nothing serious. Doctor always said I was fine. A quick checkup, a quick shot, and out the door. This whole thing is just…preposterous. You young doctors…always looking for something wrong! My father lived to 90, you know. Never saw a doctor a day in his life. <crosses arms again, looking dismissive>
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you’ve generally been very healthy. And it’s true, sometimes we find things just to be cautious. I understand your skepticism. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family? <pauses, thinking> My father…lived a long time, as I said. But he…always complained about his heart when he got old. Something about being tired and short of breath. Never went to the doctor. Mother…she died when I was young. Pneumonia, they said. Not much family history to speak of, really. Always kept to ourselves. This is pointless, isn’t it? Just…tests and questions. <shakes his head>
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter things like aspirin or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. They ache sometimes. But that’s all. <fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a small bottle of glucosamine chondroitin> See? Just this. For the knees. Nothing for my heart. This whole thing is just…a nuisance. <places the bottle on the small table beside the chair> Let's just get the tests done so I can go home. My wife will be worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. So just the glucosamine chondroitin for your knees. Now, one last thing. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, nothing. I eat everything. <waves a hand dismissively> Are you almost finished? Honestly, I haven't got all day. And be careful with the blood tests. I don't like needles. This is all very inconvenient. Just...get it done. I want to go home. And no pills. Remember, no pills. <looks pointedly at Dr. Kimm> .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. No allergies, and no pills. We’ve got everything we need for now. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood, and then we’ll get the chest X-ray ordered. We’ll take things one step at a time. I know this is inconvenient, but we need to rule out anything serious. The nurse will explain everything. I'll be back to review the results as soon as they are available.
