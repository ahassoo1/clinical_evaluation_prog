DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been having a… a constant pressure in my bladder. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely noticeable and a little uncomfortable. It just feels… full, all the time, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a constant pressure… alright. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of July. So, maybe five or six weeks now? It was gradual at first, just a little bit more frequent trips to the restroom, and now it's this… constant feeling. It hasn’t gotten worse drastically, thankfully, but it’s not improving either.
DOCTOR: Five or six weeks… and you said it’s not painful, just a persistent pressure?
PATIENT: That's right. No burning or sharp pains, no blood in my urine, nothing like that. Just… fullness. And sometimes, it feels like I haven’t fully emptied my bladder, even though I think I have. It’s a little hard to explain, honestly. Is that normal to feel that way?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a rather subjective term, Ms. Creagh. Many things can feel unusual. Let’s try to narrow things down. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good point. No, I haven’t noticed any changes in the color or smell, or anything like that. It looks pretty normal, as far as I can tell. And the amount seems… regular? I’m not going more or less frequently than usual, just feeling like I need to go more often, even if nothing much comes out. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this sensation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and my back feels completely normal. I haven’t experienced any pain anywhere else, either. It really is just this… bladder pressure, isolated to that area. I do sometimes feel a little tired, but honestly, who doesn’t these days? I don’t think that’s related.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes, I am. My husband and I are. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I’m happy to answer, but I wasn’t sure if that would be connected.
DOCTOR: It is potentially relevant, Ms. Creagh. Many conditions can present with similar symptoms, and a thorough history is crucial. Have you experienced any pain during intercourse?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No pain during intercourse, or afterward, either. Everything has been… normal in that regard. We haven't noticed anything different, and we’re both very careful, always use protection. Would that still be important to mention? Anything else you’d like to know about that? I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: "Careful" is… reassuring, I suppose. Alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had one when I was in college, maybe ten years ago? It was pretty unpleasant, and I remember having to take antibiotics. But I haven’t had one since, and I’ve been very careful to drink plenty of water and… well, just generally take good care of myself. Could this be another UTI, do you think? Though I don't have the usual burning sensation.
DOCTOR: It’s possible, though atypical presentations are not uncommon. Now, regarding your past medical history... any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was 16, but that was many years ago and healed completely. I have mild high blood pressure, but it's well-controlled with medication. And I've had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing else major that I can think of. Oh! I do have some seasonal allergies, but they haven’t been acting up lately. Does any of that sound important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy… controlled hypertension… allergies… Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And I occasionally take an over-the-counter antihistamine, Loratadine, when my allergies flare up, which hasn’t been often recently. That’s everything, I believe. I always keep a list, but I didn't think it was relevant until you asked about my medical history. I hope I'm providing enough information, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, and this is important, any family history of bladder issues, kidney problems, or related cancers?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… My mother had some bladder infections when she was older, but nothing serious. My grandmother, on my father's side, had kidney stones, I believe, but that was many years ago. And I don't believe anyone else in the family has had any significant bladder or kidney problems, or any cancers related to those areas. It's a rather healthy family, thankfully. Does that help, Doctor? I’m happy to try and recall more if you need me to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Creagh, I’m going to need to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'd like to do a quick pelvic exam. It's standard procedure, given your symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I understand. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I’ll just… adjust my clothing a little, if you don’t mind. Do you have a gown available?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a gown in the changing room just outside the door. Take your time, and then please lie down on the examination table. I'll be right back. Alright, Ms. Creagh. If you could lie back and relax, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Deep breath in… and out… normal bowel sounds. No tenderness to palpation. Anything here cause you discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing feels particularly uncomfortable at all. Just the usual… pressure, but not any sharp pain when you press. It’s difficult to explain – it’s more of a dull sensation, a constant fullness rather than a specific point of tenderness. Is that making sense? I’m trying to be as descriptive as possible.
DOCTOR: It is… adequately descriptive. Now, I’m going to perform a quick pelvic exam. Please let me know if anything causes you discomfort. Relax your muscles as much as possible… Now, can you bear down for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, I can. It doesn’t feel painful, but it is… slightly uncomfortable. It feels like there’s some pressure when I bear down, similar to the sensation I’ve been describing. Not sharp, just… full. Is that what you’re looking for, Doctor? I'm trying to be as helpful as I can. Please let me know if you need me to do anything else.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Alright. I've completed the physical exam. I do not detect any obvious abnormalities. However, given your persistent symptoms, and the fact that the physical exam isn't revealing a clear cause, I would like to order a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out a potential infection, even if it doesn't present with typical symptoms. I’d also like to order a Complete Blood Count, just to assess your overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I’m glad you’re being thorough. A urinalysis, a urine culture, and a CBC – all of that sounds reasonable. Will I need to come back for another appointment to discuss the results, or will you contact me? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like drinking more water, or avoiding certain foods? I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available in approximately 3-5 business days. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Also, if you experience any fever, chills, or increased pain, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve answered all of my questions and provided clear instructions. I appreciate your thoroughness and your time. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes, and I’ll await your call with the results. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell.
