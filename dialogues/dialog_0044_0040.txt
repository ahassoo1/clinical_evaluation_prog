DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side… lower part of my back, on both sides, really. And… I keep getting water infections, it seems. They’ve been happening more and more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain on both sides and recurrent urinary infections. Let’s unpack that a bit. First, with the back pain, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, you know? Comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s quite uncomfortable. It feels… deep inside, not really on the surface. And like I said, it’s on both sides, which is why I was a bit puzzled when it started. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse worse, thankfully, just… persistent. I haven't done anything to injure myself, that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, deep inside, on both sides, no specific injury… that's helpful. And it's not been steadily worsening, which is good. Now, when does it tend to flare up?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven't really noticed a specific time. It doesn't seem to be related to what I'm doing, or eating, or anything like that. Sometimes it's there when I wake up, sometimes after I’ve been sitting for a long time, and sometimes just… randomly. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest, because I can’t seem to pinpoint what’s causing it. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, just… a nagging discomfort.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration – those kinds of pains are the hardest to figure out. Okay, let’s switch gears for a moment and talk about these urinary infections. You mentioned they’ve been happening more frequently. Could you tell me roughly how often you're getting them?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it used to be maybe once a year, or even less. But in the last six months, I've had them… three times, I think? Maybe four. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. It’s usually burning when I go to the toilet, and I feel like I need to go all the time, even if there’s not much there. And a bit of discomfort, lower down, of course. My doctor back home used to give me some tablets, and it would clear it up, but now it just keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant increase in frequency – going from once a year to three or four times in six months is definitely something we need to look into. And you've had antibiotics prescribed before, which have helped temporarily, but the infections are recurring. Just to clarify, when you say “lower down,” are you experiencing any pain in your abdomen, or is it more specifically around your bladder area?
PATIENT: It’s more around my bladder area, yes. Not so much in my tummy, it’s… right there, where you'd expect. And sometimes it feels like I haven’t completely emptied my bladder, even after I’ve just gone. It’s not severe pain, just… annoying and uncomfortable. I try to drink plenty of water, as I’ve always been told, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder area discomfort, a sensation of incomplete emptying… good to know. Drinking plenty of water is a good habit, certainly. Now, let's go through some other things, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, any blood?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes the urine is a bit cloudy, I think. And a couple of times, I noticed a bit of… a reddish tinge to it. Not a lot, mind you, just enough to make me notice. The smell… well, it’s not always normal, let’s say that. Sometimes it’s quite strong, a bit unpleasant. I haven't kept a close eye on it, to be honest, I just noticed it when I've gone to the toilet. I get a bit embarrassed talking about this, I must admit. It's not very dignified, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel a bit embarrassed, Mr. Espinueva, but it’s very important information, and you’re doing the right thing by sharing it with me. It’s my job to ask these questions. Cloudy urine, a reddish tinge, and changes in smell… all of these things point us in the right direction. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check of your abdomen and back, and I'll also want to take a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. An exam and a sample, yes, go ahead. I just hope it isn't anything too serious. I'm not a young man anymore, and I don't want to be stuck in a hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let’s start with the exam. If you could lie down on the table, please. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, then gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. It won't be uncomfortable, I promise. After that, we'll collect a urine sample.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Take your time. No rush at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally, Mr. Espinueva. Anything feel particularly tender there?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. A little pressure, of course, but nothing… sharp, or unexpected. Maybe a bit of discomfort on the left side, but it’s nothing I haven’t felt before. Just that dull ache, I suppose. It’s hard to tell, really, to be honest. I get aches and pains all over these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what about here, along your lower back?
PATIENT: A little bit of stiffness, Doctor. That's not unusual, though. I used to do a lot of gardening, you see, and my back isn't what it used to be. It’s more of a tight feeling, really, rather than pain. When you press there, on the left side, it feels… a bit achy, yes. But again, it's not a sudden, sharp pain. It’s just that familiar ache. I do try to keep active, you know, but these old bones aren’t as forgiving as they once were.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. There is some tenderness there on the left side. Not alarming, but something to keep in mind. Alright, now if you could just provide a urine sample for me, please. There’s a specimen cup in the bathroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream, and finish. And please, try not to get any skin cells in the sample. I'll give you a few minutes of privacy. Just let me know when you’re done.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. A mid-stream sample. I think I remember how to do that. I’ll call out when I’m finished.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Espinueva. And don't hesitate to call out if you need anything at all. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: … … Alright, Doctor, I’ve got the sample for you. I hope I did it properly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. Yes, that looks perfectly fine. We’ll send this off to the lab for a full analysis – we’ll check for infection, blood, and other indicators. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. While we're waiting for the results, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your overall health. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. My weight has been pretty stable, thankfully. Maybe a pound or two here and there, but nothing significant. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables, and I don’t really indulge in sweets or processed foods. It’s hard to stay on top of things when you get older, but I do my best. I’ve noticed a little bit of swelling in my ankles sometimes, especially at the end of the day, but I put that down to getting older, and being on my feet too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight, mostly healthy diet, occasional ankle swelling… good to know. And what about any difficulties with urination itself?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes it takes me a little while to get started, if I’m honest. And I don’t feel like I empty my bladder completely, even after I've gone. It's not a new thing, it's been going on for a while now, gradually getting a little worse, I suppose. I haven't thought much of it, just put it down to getting older again. I don’t have any pain when I actually go, just that feeling of… incompleteness. And like I said, I need to go quite frequently, especially at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, hesitancy, incomplete emptying, frequency, especially at night… all of these things are important pieces of the puzzle. And just one more question for now: have you ever had any kidney stones?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. I don’t think so. I remember my mother having kidney stones once, it was very painful, but I don’t recall ever being told I had them myself. I’ve certainly never passed anything, if you know what I mean. But I’m not very good with remembering medical details, to be honest. I’ve had quite a few visits to doctors over the years, and everything tends to blend together. I think my doctor back home did some scans once, but I don't remember the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known history of kidney stones, though some past scans were performed. That’s helpful. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary findings of the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. The recurrent urinary infections, the lower back pain, the incomplete emptying, and the frequency could all be related. We'll wait for the lab results to guide us, but for now, I suspect there may be an issue with your prostate, causing some obstruction to the flow of urine. That can lead to incomplete emptying, which then increases the risk of infection. The lower back pain could be related, or it could be something separate. We’ll need to do some further tests to confirm this. I'd like to order a PSA blood test – that’s a prostate-specific antigen test – and a urine culture and sensitivity – that will identify the specific bacteria causing the infections, and determine which antibiotics will be most effective. I'd also like to schedule an ultrasound of your kidneys and bladder. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. A PSA test, a urine culture, and an ultrasound… I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and feel like myself again. When can we schedule the ultrasound? And how long will it take to get the results of the other tests?
DOCTOR: Good. We can get the ultrasound scheduled for next week, let’s say Wednesday morning at 9 am?
PATIENT: Yes, Wednesday morning at 9 am sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. And the other tests, how long will those take to come back? I’m not in a hurry, but I'd like to have some idea of the timeframe.
DOCTOR: The PSA test usually takes 2-3 business days to come back. The urine culture takes a bit longer, usually 3-5 business days, as it needs time to grow the bacteria. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to treat the current infection. It's a common antibiotic called Trimethoprim. Take the full course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. And drink plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Trimethoprim, and plenty of water. I'll make sure to finish the full course, and drink lots of fluids. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. Is there anything else I should be doing, or avoiding, while we're waiting for the results? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. For now, there aren’t any specific restrictions. Try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. And if you notice any new or worsening symptoms – fever, chills, severe pain in your back or abdomen, difficulty urinating – please contact the office immediately. I’m also going to give you a handout with some information about prostate health, and some tips on managing urinary symptoms. It’s just a general overview, but it might be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly, and I feel much more reassured now. The handout is a nice touch, thank you. I think I'm all set for now. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll see you next week, then? On Wednesday morning at 9 am?
DOCTOR: Yes, Wednesday morning at 9 am. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Espinueva. Take care, and I'll see you next week.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Asami. Thank you again for everything.
