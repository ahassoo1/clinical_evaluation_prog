DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, just… gradually. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It's quite bothersome, actually. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It just is.
DOCTOR: "Gradually" is… not particularly helpful, Ms. Kobler. We need to establish a timeline, if possible. Can you think of anything that might have coincided with the onset of these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You are right, of course. A timeline… It’s difficult. I… I was divorced last year, sometime in the spring, I believe. Perhaps it was around then? Things were… unsettled then. It's all a bit of a blur, truthfully. Was the breathing worse then? I… I honestly can’t say for certain. It feels like it’s been getting worse steadily, but pinning it to a specific moment… I'm afraid I can't.
DOCTOR: Divorce is… stressful, certainly. But stress rarely manifests as isolated respiratory and ocular dryness. Let’s try a different approach. Can you describe the breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not… a terrible struggle, Doctor. More like… a tightness, in my chest, sometimes. And I have to… take a few extra breaths to feel full. It's worse when I’m walking, or if I’ve been… exerting myself. But even just sitting, I notice it. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable. And the dryness… my eyes feel gritty, and my mouth feels like sandpaper. I’m always drinking water, but it doesn’t really help for very long.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this dryness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… more constant, I believe. It’s worst in the mornings, when I wake up. And it gets worse as the day goes on. Even with the water, it doesn't go away, it just… lessens a bit. It’s a very… persistent discomfort. I suppose I've just gotten used to it, to a degree. But it’s starting to… worry me.
DOCTOR: "Getting used to it" is precisely why you're here, Ms. Kobler. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. I’ve been… rather tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. And sometimes… my joints ache, a little. Just a dull ache, mostly in my hands and knees. Nothing debilitating, but noticeable. And… I’ve lost my appetite somewhat. Not a great deal of weight, but I don’t really feel hungry. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Kobler. Fatigue, arthralgia, and loss of appetite… these symptoms, combined with the respiratory and ocular dryness, are… suggestive. Have you experienced any fever, rash, or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I recall. No fever, no rash, and my muscles feel… normal, I suppose. A little achy sometimes, but that could just be from… everyday things. I haven’t noticed any real weakness, no. I’m still able to do… what I need to do. Just… tired afterwards. I do tend to get… lost in my writing, sometimes forgetting to eat or drink. Perhaps that contributes to the tiredness. I don’t know. I truly don’t.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, while I appreciate your attempts at self-diagnosis, it's my job to determine the cause of your symptoms. Now, let’s go through some standard questions. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You are right to ask. Allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything, as far as I know. Perhaps a little bit of… seasonal sniffles, in the spring, but nothing major. No medications, no foods that I’m aware of. I’m generally quite… robust, in that regard. Although… I did have a reaction to a bee sting when I was a child, but that was many years ago. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: A bee sting reaction is noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to… avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in… letting the body heal itself, as much as possible. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s… very sporadic. Not a regular thing. Just when I remember. And nothing else. Absolutely nothing else.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. My past medical history… That’s a difficult question. I haven’t been to a doctor in… quite a long time, truthfully. I’ve always been… relatively healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. I did have a bout of pneumonia when I was in my twenties, but I recovered fully. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a teenager. But beyond that… I don’t really have a medical history to speak of. I’m afraid I’m not very helpful in that regard. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, a lack of a documented medical history doesn’t necessarily equate to a lack of medical issues. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve always been… fortunate enough to avoid surgery. I’ve never needed it. No surgeries of any kind. I’ve always been… very careful, I suppose. And I've been… relatively lucky, in that regard. It’s just… never been necessary. Is that… helpful? I feel I’m just rambling now. I apologize. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: It’s… acceptable. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s another difficult question, Doctor. My family… wasn’t very forthcoming about medical matters. My mother… didn’t talk much about her health, and my father… passed away when I was very young. I know he had… heart problems, I believe. But beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. I didn’t… keep in close contact with my relatives, and I didn’t… ask many questions. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s… less than ideal, Ms. Kobler. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s very infrequent. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I find them… distasteful, and unhealthy. I prefer… a quiet life, focused on my writing. I find that… sufficient. It’s a very… simple existence, but I’m content with it. Is that… helpful? I’m truly trying to be as forthcoming as possible. I just… don’t have much medical information to offer.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to perform a physical examination. I'll need you to remove your shoes and socks. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll be listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate and blood pressure, and examining your eyes and throat.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I’m ready whenever you are. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if I need to adjust my position.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear to auscultation with mild crackles bilaterally at the bases. Heart rate is 88 beats per minute, blood pressure is 130 over 80. Your eyes show some mild injection and dryness. Throat is slightly red, but no signs of acute infection. I’m also noting some dryness of the oral mucosa. Lymph nodes are normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Please, let me know if I need to adjust anything. I confess, I’m rather anxious about all of this. Not that I don’t trust you, Doctor, but… medical examinations have never been my forte.
DOCTOR: Reflexes and muscle strength are normal bilaterally. There's some mild tenderness in the joints, particularly in your hands and knees, but no swelling or deformity. Based on the physical examination and your reported symptoms, several possibilities come to mind. However, to narrow down the diagnosis, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an antinuclear antibody test. We’ll also check your rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein levels. Do you have any objections to having these tests done?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh. No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Not really. If it will help determine what’s… going on, then I suppose it’s necessary. I trust your judgment. I… I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I don’t know much about these tests, to be honest. What exactly will they… reveal? And will they be… painful? I apologize for all the questions. I’m just… a bit apprehensive.
DOCTOR: The tests will help us assess your overall health, look for signs of inflammation, and rule out certain autoimmune conditions. The complete blood count will check your red and white blood cell counts, the comprehensive metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function, and the antinuclear antibody test, rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein levels will help us determine if there's any underlying autoimmune process. As for pain, the blood draw itself may cause a brief, mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t be significant. Here’s the requisition for the blood tests. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. Once the results are available – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. I’m also going to prescribe artificial tears to help with your dry eyes. Do you have any questions about the tests or the artificial tears?
PATIENT: Artificial tears… that sounds… pleasant, actually. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… stay hydrated, rest, and the tests… I’ll schedule those as soon as possible. Thank you for… explaining everything so thoroughly. I… I feel a little better, knowing there’s a plan. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or any symptoms I should be particularly mindful of?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, should you experience any fever, shortness of breath, or significant chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Also, if your symptoms worsen significantly, don’t hesitate to contact me. Otherwise, follow the recommendations, get the tests done, and we'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Here’s a pamphlet with some additional information about dry eyes and autoimmune conditions. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that will be all. Thank you again for your time and your… patience. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your kindness. I’ll schedule the tests immediately. And I’ll be sure to contact you if anything… changes. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Kobler. I expect to see you soon. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
