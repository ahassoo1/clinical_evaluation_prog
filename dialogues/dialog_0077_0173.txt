DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve just been feeling really chilly lately. Like, not a fever, just… cold. It started a few days ago, I think. It’s just been bothering me.
DOCTOR: I see. “Feeling chilly,” you say. And this has been going on for a few days now. Hmm. Could you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Um, okay. It’s not like shivering cold, more like… I just need an extra sweater when everyone else is comfortable. And my hands and feet feel cold, even when I’m sitting down. It’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jailenne. Thank you for clarifying. So, it’s a persistent coldness, needing extra layers, and primarily in your extremities… your hands and feet, you said. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this chill?
PATIENT: Not really, actually. No cough, no sore throat, no aches or anything. Just… cold. I’ve been trying to drink lots of tea, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Oh! And maybe a little tired, but I always feel a bit tired, to be honest. It’s hard to say if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other accompanying symptoms… just the chill and a general feeling of fatigue. And the fatigue is something you experience generally, not necessarily new with this chill?
PATIENT: Exactly. The tiredness is just… me, you know? It’s not worse than usual. It's definitely the chill that's new. And honestly, it's a bit annoying because I have a lot to do. I'm a health education specialist, so I'm always running around. It’s hard to focus when I’m cold.
DOCTOR: I understand. Being a health education specialist certainly keeps you busy, and being uncomfortable would make focusing difficult. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the flu once, like everyone does, but nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I’m generally pretty healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so weird. I usually bounce back quickly when I get sick.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No chronic medical conditions. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I've broken a bone or two as a kid, a wrist and an arm, but those healed up fine. Nothing requiring a big operation, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some issues with his cholesterol. Nothing serious, you know? And my grandmother on my mother's side had arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing that I'm particularly worried about, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and cholesterol in your parents, arthritis in your grandmother. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications before. I'm pretty lucky, I think. I haven't had to take many medicines though, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. I try to be good, you know? But I don't take it every day. It's not regular, at all. I mostly just forget. Oh! And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I get a headache, but that’s it. Definitely not a regular thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, let's just do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat on the examination table, that would be perfect. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and temperature, and just take a look at your hands and feet. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let me just examine your hands… Your hands feel cool to the touch, and your skin looks normal in color. No swelling or tenderness noted. Your feet are also cool to the touch. Capillary refill is slightly delayed, around 3 seconds. That means it takes a little longer for the color to return after I press on your skin.
PATIENT: Okay. Three seconds is… long, right? Is that bad? I don’t know much about all this medical stuff. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's slightly prolonged, yes, Jailenne. Normal capillary refill is typically under two seconds. A delay of three seconds could indicate reduced circulation, but it's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. Given your other symptoms – the chill, the cool extremities, but otherwise feeling well – it suggests we need to investigate a little further. It could be something simple, like Raynaud’s phenomenon, which affects blood flow in response to cold. But we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. These tests will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood tests are fine. I guess. I don’t love needles, but if it helps figure out what's going on, then yeah. What do I have to do? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work, you know. I need to plan around it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. The blood draw itself is very quick, just a small pinch. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and it typically takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. We can call you with the results as soon as they are available. Here is the requisition form. You can take this to the lab just down the street. They are open Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm. In the meantime, try to keep warm, and stay hydrated. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop any fever, chest pain, or significant fatigue – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. Warm and hydrated. I can do that. And I’ll take this to the lab tomorrow. 2-3 business days… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into it. I was starting to worry it was all in my head.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. It’s always best to investigate these things thoroughly, and I’m glad we’re getting it checked out. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here is some information on Raynaud’s phenomenon, just in case. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you once we have the results.
