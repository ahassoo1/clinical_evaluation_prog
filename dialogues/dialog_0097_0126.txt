DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling…rather off. I’m excessively thirsty, constantly, and hungry too, even right after I’ve eaten. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s quite bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that does sound bothersome. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, roughly three or four weeks, give or take. It started subtly, just feeling a bit more parched than usual, and a little peckish between meals. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. I find myself drinking…a lot more water than I used to, and still feeling quite thirsty. And the hunger…it’s not normal. It's…constant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…not that I can readily recall, no. Work’s been the same old routine at the shipping yard. Divorced a year ago, so that's settled. No new medications. Can’t think of anything particularly stressful happening either. It's just…appeared. Rather frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say thirsty, are we talking just a dry mouth, or are you feeling like you need to drink large amounts to feel satisfied, even for a short time?
PATIENT: It’s definitely the latter, Doctor. Not just a dry mouth. I can drink a large glass of water, and feel…better, for perhaps half an hour. Then the thirst returns, as if I hadn’t had anything at all. It’s not a relief that lasts. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I find myself constantly reaching for something to drink.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…aye, I suppose I have. I'm going to the bathroom…more frequently, and in larger quantities, if that makes sense. It's…noticeable, though I hadn't consciously connected it to the thirst until now. It’s been happening alongside the increased drinking, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you experienced any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss…that’s a good question. I haven’t been actively trying to lose weight, and I haven’t noticed a dramatic change, but my trousers feel a little looser than they did a month ago. It’s not significant, mind you, but I’ve had to tighten my belt a notch or two. It's difficult to say if it's intentional or not, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any blurry vision, fatigue, or slow-healing sores or infections?
PATIENT: Blurry vision…no, not that I’ve noticed. Fatigue…well, work’s tiring, naturally, but no more so than usual. And no slow-healing sores or infections, thankfully. I cut myself shaving a few days ago, and it healed up fine. I’m generally quite healthy, otherwise. I haven’t been feeling ill or anything like that. Just…this thirst and hunger. It's rather specific, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to do a quick blood glucose test, just to rule a few things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to oblige. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I'm not fond of lingering uncertainties. Please proceed when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m just going to prick your finger for a quick blood glucose test. Okay, that's a bit high. A normal reading is typically below 100 mg/dL. This result, combined with your symptoms – the excessive thirst, frequent urination, hunger, and unexplained weight loss – is suggestive of diabetes. Now, this is just a preliminary test. We'll need to do some further blood work to confirm this and determine the type. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens. That…isn’t what I was expecting, Doctor. Aye, that makes sense, I suppose, given the symptoms you've outlined and the reading you’ve just obtained. Further blood work…yes, of course. Whatever is necessary to get a proper diagnosis. I… I must admit, I’m a bit shaken. But thank you for identifying this so quickly. What sort of blood work are we looking at, and what happens next?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It's good we're addressing this. It can be a bit unsettling to hear, but early detection is key to managing diabetes effectively. We'll need to do a fasting plasma glucose test, and an A1C test. The fasting test measures your blood glucose after you haven't eaten for at least eight hours. The A1C test gives us an average of your blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. I'll also order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. I’ll give you a requisition form for the lab. You can go anytime, but it’s best to fast for the glucose test, so perhaps first thing tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we can discuss the type of diabetes, the best course of treatment, and make a plan to manage your blood sugar. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds…thorough, which is reassuring. Fasting until tomorrow morning is no trouble at all. A requisition form, yes, please. I’d be grateful for any written information about diabetes you might have as well, if that’s possible. I’d like to…prepare myself a bit. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s…a lot to take in, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get this under control. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here you are. This handout covers the basics of type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form. It explains the symptoms, causes, and treatment options. I also have some reputable websites listed if you'd like to do some more research. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the lab results are in, usually within a week. In the meantime, please try to avoid sugary drinks and foods. Continue to drink plenty of water. If you experience any unusual symptoms – such as extreme fatigue, blurred vision, or frequent infections – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you for the materials. No, I don’t believe I do, not at this moment. I’d like to…digest this information a bit before asking further questions, if that’s alright. Avoiding sugar and drinking water…aye, I can manage that. A follow-up appointment within a week sounds good. I appreciate your time and…your frankness, Doctor. This has been…informative, to say the least. I’ll see you then.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call if anything comes to mind. It was a pleasure meeting you, Christen. We'll get this under control. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week.
