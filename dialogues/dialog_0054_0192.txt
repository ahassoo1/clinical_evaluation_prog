DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning to you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… this exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first, you know? Seems a bit silly, but rules are rules. Don’t really see what a doctor’s gonna do for them, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-military exam. I understand. It’s standard procedure, and actually a very good thing – makes sure everyone is fit and ready. So, to help me get a good picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little more about why you’re joining up?
PATIENT: Joining up? Well, my boy, Erik, he's already in. Doing… something with computers, I think. Always was good with those things. And… well, things ain't been easy lately, you know? Work’s been slow. Thought I’d give it a go. A steady paycheck and all that. Plus, Erik says it's good for a man. Builds character, he says. I mostly just need a job. Is that enough of a reason? Don't really have a story or anything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Hartness. A desire for stability and a good job is a very valid reason. And wanting to follow in your son's footsteps is admirable. Let's focus on making sure you're physically up to the task. To start, can you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: General health, huh? Well, I wouldn't say I'm sick sick. I get a bit of a cough in the winter, always have. And my back... my back's been a bit dodgy since I lifted that engine block last year. Nearly threw it out. Nothing a bit of rest won't fix, usually. I eat alright, I suppose. Mostly meat and potatoes. Don't bother much with fruits and vegetables. Not a fan. And I drink… well, a few beers with the lads on a Friday night. Nothing crazy. Does that cover “general health”? Seems like a lot of questions for just a quick check-up.
DOCTOR: That's a good start, Mr. Hartness. It helps me get a fuller picture. The cough in the winter and the back pain are good things to note. And I appreciate you being honest about the beer. Let's dig a little deeper into that back pain. When did it start, specifically?
PATIENT: Like I said, last year. September, I think. Was working on old Sven’s tractor. Needed a new engine. Heavy thing, that engine. I had it on a hoist, but it slipped a bit when I was trying to line it up. Felt a proper wrench in my back, it did. Didn’t go to the doctor then. Just took it easy for a few days, put some cream on it. Worked alright after that, mostly. Just gets a bit sore if I lift anything too heavy, or if I bend over for too long. It's not… constant, you know? Comes and goes. Does that make sense? I’m not a doctor, so I don’t know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Hartness. A slipped engine and a wrench in your back… I can imagine that would be painful. And it’s good you’ve been managing it, even if it’s just with rest. Just to clarify, when you say “sore,” can you describe the type of pain?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a sharp pain, not all the time. More like a… dull ache. Deep down, you know? And it can sometimes… shoot down my leg a bit. Not often, but it happens. Like a… tingling feeling. And if I sit for too long, it gets worse. Standing's better. Walking's alright. Lying down helps, too, but only if I'm on my side. Not on my back. That makes it proper bad. Honestly, it's a nuisance more than anything. But I get by. You're asking a lot of questions about my back. Is it that important? They just want me to hold a gun, not lift cars.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Hartness. It's important because back pain can sometimes indicate a more serious problem, even if it's not constant. We want to make sure everything is structurally sound, especially given the demands of military service. The tingling down your leg is also something we need to consider. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, never been diagnosed with anything. Never. Always been healthy as a horse, mostly. Had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but that was a long time ago. No heart trouble, no high blood pressure, no nothing. Don't even go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time, if you ask me. Used to have a bit of trouble with my eyesight, but I got these glasses, and that sorted it out. I told you, healthy as a horse. My wife, Ingrid, she's the one who's always getting sick. Colds, the flu… you name it. But me? Solid. Always been solid.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Hartness. No major medical history is definitely a positive. And it sounds like you’ve been fortunate with your health. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Not even for my wisdom teeth. They just pulled ‘em out. Awful business, that was. But no surgeries. Nothing. Ingrid had her gallbladder out a few years back, but that's her problem, not mine. I keep telling her she needs to eat less fried food, but she never listens. Women, eh? But me? No surgeries. Definitely not. I’m a whole piece. Never been cut open.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That's good. Let's move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother… she passed away a few years back. Cancer. Lung cancer. Smoked all her life, didn't care for warnings. My father… he died when I was a boy. Heart attack, they said. Worked too hard, never took a day off. Ingrid’s parents? Both still alive, but they're getting on a bit. Old age mostly. Ingrid says her mother has a bit of trouble with her joints. Arthritis, I think. But that's about it. Nothing major. Sad business, all this dying, eh? Makes you think. But no, not much in the way of serious family history. Just old age and bad habits.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your mother and father, Mr. Hartness. And about Ingrid’s parents. It's good you're thinking about these things. Now, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What’s that supposed to mean? You asking about my friends? I've got a few lads I meet with at the pub on Fridays. Good blokes. Mostly work in the factory, same as me. We talk about football, cars, the usual. I'm married, as I said. Been with Ingrid for thirty years. She keeps me in line. That's about it, really. I don’t go to fancy parties or anything. Not much of a social butterfly, if you know what I mean. Just a simple life. Is that what you’re after? Is this getting back to the important stuff? This is a pre-military exam, not a life story interview.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Hartness. It is important to get to the important stuff. Social history simply helps us understand your lifestyle—things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and your occupation. You've already mentioned the alcohol on Fridays. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never smoked. Never even tried it. Ingrid hates it. Smells awful, she says, and it’s bad for your health. Always been a bit of a clean liver, you could say. Never really been one for vices, except maybe a good beer on a Friday. And the occasional slice of cake. Ingrid makes a mean chocolate cake, you see. But no, no smoking. Never touched the stuff. Always thought it was a bit silly, to be honest. Paying money to ruin your lungs? Doesn't make much sense. So, no smoking. Happy? Can we get on with this now? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, we are getting there. And that’s good to know, no smoking. Now, just one last question about your social history. What do you do for work?
PATIENT: I told you, I work at the factory. Assemble engines, mostly. And other machines. Been doing it for… oh, thirty years now. Steady work, it is. Not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Long hours, though. And it's getting harder on my back, if you want to know the truth. That's why I'm thinking of joining up. Maybe something a bit less… physical. Although I suppose the military is pretty physical, isn't it? Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Just trying to find something better. Is this all the questions? Because I'm starting to get a bit tired of talking about myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, we’re almost there. Thank you for being so open with me. And I understand your concerns about the physical demands. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Except maybe snails. Don’t care for snails. Ingrid tried to make escargots once, but I wouldn’t touch them. But no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can handle wasps, bees, the whole lot. Sometimes I get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that's just hay fever, I reckon. Not a proper allergy. Solid as a rock, I tell you. No allergies. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, that is excellent. No allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not a single pill. I don’t believe in taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I get by on good food and a bit of fresh air. Well, as much fresh air as you get in this town. Ingrid tries to get me to take vitamins, but I tell her I’m getting everything I need from my diet. She worries too much, that woman. But no, no medications. Never been much of a pill-popper. Is that it? Are we finally finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, that is all the questions. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a quick look at your back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. And nothing too invasive, yeah? Just a quick look. I haven't got all day. But yeah, go ahead. As long as you're gentle. My back's a bit sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, just take some nice, deep breaths for me, Mr. Hartness. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Okay, just tell me if anything feels particularly sore or tender. And can you bend forward for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. Careful there! That’s a bit tender, yeah? Right about… there. Not awful, but definitely not comfortable. And bending over… … isn’t getting any easier. Feels a bit tight, you know? Like something’s stuck. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. See? I told you. It's not just an old man’s complaint. It’s proper sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that, Mr. Hartness. There is some tenderness and tightness in your lower back muscles. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and bending forward does seem to cause some discomfort. I also noted a slight asymmetry in your spine, though it’s not significant. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it seems you likely have a muscle strain in your lower back. It’s not an emergency, but it’s something we need to address. To be sure, and to rule out anything more serious, I would like to get an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Now hold on a minute. An X-ray? That sounds… serious. Is it really necessary? I just want to join the military, not end up with a load of radiation. I told you, it's just a bit of a sore back. I’ve pulled muscles before. A bit of rest and a bit of cream usually sorts it out. I don't want to be messing around with X-rays and all that. Is there any other way? Can’t you just tell me to take it easy and put some cream on it? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I don't like the sound of this one bit.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. You're right to ask questions and express your hesitation. An X-ray isn’t always necessary, but given your age and the fact that the pain hasn’t resolved with rest, I want to rule out any underlying structural issues – like a small fracture or arthritis – before recommending a treatment plan. We can discuss alternatives, but without an X-ray, it's difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis and ensure we're not missing something important. To put it simply, the X-ray will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your back. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. However, if you’re absolutely opposed to an X-ray at this time, we can proceed with a conservative treatment plan – rest, ice, over-the-counter pain relievers, and potentially a referral to a physical therapist. But please understand that without an X-ray, there's a risk that we could be overlooking a more serious condition. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you really think it’s necessary… fine. Do the X-ray. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. And if it shows up anything bad, I’m blaming you. Honestly, this is just getting more and more complicated. But fine. Do the X-ray. But quick, yeah? I haven’t got all day. And minimal radiation, you promised. Just get it over with. And tell me what to expect. Is it painful? Will I have to lie flat for hours? I've got things to do, you know. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. We’ll get the X-ray done quickly and efficiently. It’s a very straightforward procedure. You’ll simply stand or lie on a table while a technician takes a few images of your lower back. It doesn’t involve any injections or invasive procedures, and it shouldn’t be painful – you might feel a slight pressure as the machine takes the images. You won’t need to lie flat for hours afterward. You can go about your normal activities immediately following the X-ray. The technician will explain everything to you before we begin. I’ll have the results sent to me within 24-48 hours. Once I’ve reviewed them, we can discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. Let me call the technician and get you set up. It will only take a few minutes. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, no more questions. Just… get it over with, alright? I’m ready when you are. Honestly, this whole thing is a bit of a… nuisance. But if you say it’s necessary, fine. Just… let’s get it done. And tell that technician to be quick, yeah? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I'll let the technician know you're ready. It’ll be quick and easy, I promise. They're very experienced. Just follow their instructions, and we'll get this taken care of. "Technician, could you come in here for a moment?
