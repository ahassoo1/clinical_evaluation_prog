DOCTOR: Hello Brendan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Kimm, nice to meet you too. It’s this itching, see. It’s all over, really. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it's…well, just annoying, to be honest. Not painful, just…itchy. Everywhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, “itchy everywhere” for a few weeks. That does sound frustrating. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, thankfully, but it’s not going away either. It’s…consistent, you know? Like, it’s always there, a background irritation. Doesn't really matter what I’m wearing, or what I’ve been doing, it just…is. I've tried a few different lotions, mostly just things I had in the house, but nothing seems to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent itching for a few weeks, not worsening, and not relieved by lotions you've already tried. That gives us a starting point. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or after doing certain activities?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think so, actually. I've tried to pay attention, but it feels pretty much the same all day. Maybe…maybe a little more noticeable after a shower? But honestly, I’m probably just more aware of it then, you know? Warm water and all. It doesn’t start the itching, it just feels…more intense for a bit afterward.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a little worse immediately after a shower, but not a clear trigger. And you said it’s been going on for a few weeks. Has anything changed in your life around the time it started?
PATIENT: Let me think…a few weeks…around the beginning of July, I guess. No, nothing major… My wife, bless her, passed away last year, so things are still…adjusting, you know? I started volunteering at the library, a couple afternoons a week, but that’s been going on for longer than that now. No new soaps or detergents…I haven’t been anywhere different, really. I mostly stay around here.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Brendan. Adjusting to such a significant loss takes a lot of time. Thank you for sharing that. Volunteering is wonderful, though. Okay, so no obvious new exposures or changes besides the volunteering. I'm going to ask some more general questions now, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my annual check-up last spring, and the doctor said everything was fine. Blood pressure's a little high, they said, but I take a pill for that every day. Otherwise, pretty healthy for my age, I think. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. They run a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. High blood pressure managed with medication, and otherwise healthy according to your last check-up. That's helpful. What about any allergies?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I don’t go running around in fields of wildflowers, so I don't know of any, you know? A little dust sometimes bothers my nose, but that's it. Never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, food or otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the one. A small white pill, I take it every morning with breakfast. Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, if it’s really bothering me, but that’s just over-the-counter ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication regularly, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just need you to remove your shirt and shoes. I’ll start by looking at your skin to see if I can spot anything obvious, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brendan. Your skin looks generally normal, no obvious rashes or anything concerning. Your heart and lungs sound good. I don't see any immediate signs of an obvious skin condition. The itching being all over, and not responding to lotions, and with no visible skin changes, makes me think of a few possibilities. It could be something systemic - meaning something going on inside your body. Or it could be related to nerve issues. Do you experience any numbness, tingling, or burning sensations alongside the itch?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the itch. It’s…annoying, but it doesn't burn or anything. And I definitely don't feel numb. Just…itchy. I did notice something, now that you mention it, though. Sometimes, after I’ve been sitting for a while, my feet feel a little…restless, you know? Like I need to move them. But not tingling, just restless.
DOCTOR: Okay, restless legs sometimes, but no tingling. That's good information. Given your history of high blood pressure, the all-over itch, and the restless legs, I'm going to order a few blood tests. We'll check your kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count just to rule out anything obvious. It’s also possible this is related to medication side effects, though your blood pressure medication isn’t commonly associated with itching. Would you be alright with getting some blood drawn today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. Better to check everything, you know? Hopefully, they’ll figure out what’s causing this itch.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll write the orders for the lab now. They’re just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. It's a pretty standard blood draw. Once the results come back – usually takes a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I can recommend a soothing lotion with colloidal oatmeal to help manage the itch. It won't cure it, but it might provide some relief. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A lotion would be good, just to get some temporary relief. A few days is fine for the results. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I'm glad I could help. Here's the order for the lab, and a prescription for the colloidal oatmeal lotion. It's available at most pharmacies. I'll also have the nurse give you a list of potential side effects to watch out for, although they’re rare with this medication. If anything changes or the itch gets significantly worse before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll get you in as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and…reassuring, to be honest. I'll head down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Take care, and we'll see you in a few days. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
