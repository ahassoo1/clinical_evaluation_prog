DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Scobie, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Laury Scobie. But everyone just calls me Laury.
DOCTOR: Very well, Laury. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I was thinking… about my family. I don’t know much about where they come from, way back. I hear stories, but… not much solid. I want to know more. I was hoping you could… test something? Like, with spit? My niece, she did one of those tests… to see where her people are from.
DOCTOR: A genealogy test?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it! Genealogy… is that right? She said it showed her ancestors, places and things. I want to see if I can find out more about my family, you know? Where we really come from. I been thinkin' about it a long time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I’m a medical doctor. I specialize in internal medicine. While understanding your family history is… admirable, that’s not something I offer here. Those tests are… direct-to-consumer, you see. And frankly, the accuracy can be… questionable. We deal with your health concerns here, not ancestry. Do you have any medical issues you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I didn't know that. I thought… doctors could do anything. I just… I want to know where I come from. I don’t have any sicknesses, not really. Just… old. Is there someone else I should see, then? Someone who does the spit tests?
DOCTOR: You could try a genetic testing company online. They advertise frequently. But I must reiterate, I don't recommend them for medical purposes. If you're experiencing any health concerns, changes in your wellbeing, or have family history of illness, then we can proceed with a relevant medical workup. Otherwise… I'm not sure what I can do for you today. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medicines. Never have. Just… old bones, that’s all. I just thought… maybe this doctor could help. I guess not. So, you can’t even tell me where I should look for these tests? Like, a name of a place? Or a person?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I appreciate you coming in, but my expertise lies in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. I’m not a genealogical resource. A simple internet search will provide numerous options for those tests. I have other patients waiting, and frankly, this is not a productive use of my time. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I didn’t… I just wanted to know more about my family. No, I guess not. Sorry to bother you. I'll just… go then. Thank you for… tryin', I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any changes in your health, please schedule an appointment. Good day, Mr. Scobie.
PATIENT: .
