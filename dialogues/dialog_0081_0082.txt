DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… morning. I… need travel stuff. For… going somewhere. My wife… she wanted to go. Now… well, now it’s just me. I need… the things she was talking about. Shots? Pills? I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Travel… right. And where are you planning to travel to, Mr. Tayar?
PATIENT: Somewhere… hot. Very hot. Islands, I think. She liked islands. Not… America. Too many people. Somewhere… smaller. With beaches. I don't know the name. She booked everything. I just… followed along. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Complicated is alright. Let’s try to narrow it down. Do you have any documentation of this trip?
PATIENT: Documentation? Like… papers? Uh… maybe? I think there was… a thick envelope. With her name on it. It’s… at home. In a box. With other… things. I haven’t really looked through it. Too… sad. I don't know what's in it. Mostly just bills, I guess. She took care of all that.
DOCTOR: Right. Bills. Well, without knowing the destination, it’s difficult to advise on necessary vaccinations or preventative medications. It’s rather crucial information, Mr. Tayar. Do you recall anything about the islands?
PATIENT: Islands… hmm. She said… it was good for… my skin. The sun. And the water. Blue water. Lots of fish. Not… Europe. Too cold. It wasn’t… Africa. She said it was… safer. Smaller islands. Not… a big country island. Does that… help? I really don't know. I wasn't the one planning the trip! She always did everything. It was always "Odell, just follow me." And now… now I'm here, alone.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, while I sympathize with your… situation, I need concrete information to provide you with proper medical advice. "Good for the skin" and "blue water" isn't enough to determine what precautions you need to take. Do you have any recollection of airlines, hotel names, or even the language spoken there?
PATIENT: Airline… maybe? Big plane. I think… red on the side. Not one of those cheap ones. She always liked… comfortable. Hotel… white building. By the beach. Everything was white. Palm trees. That's all I remember. Language… not English. But not… French. Or… Spanish. Something… softer. Not… harsh. Maybe… island language? I don’t know! I really don’t know anything. She did everything. Why do I have to remember? It’s not fair.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. Let's try a different approach. I'm going to access your electronic health record. Perhaps there's information about previous travel or medications that might give us a clue. It's possible she entered the destination details during a prior appointment. One moment. Hmm… nothing here about travel plans. No mention of vaccinations. This is… unhelpful. Do you have a primary care physician we can contact?
PATIENT: Primary… doctor? She had one. Back in… the city. But I never went with her. She said I was… healthy enough. Didn't need to bother him. I just… followed her to appointments when she was sick. I don't know his name. Or where his office is. I just… drove. She told me where to go. Everything was always… her way. This is… useless. Really useless.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, you are asking me to provide medical recommendations for a trip to an unknown location with no prior medical history or documentation. That is… irresponsible, and frankly, impossible. Without knowing where you’re going, I cannot advise on necessary vaccinations, malaria prophylaxis, or even basic travel health precautions. We need to establish something concrete. Perhaps you could check her bank statements for payments to airlines or hotels?
PATIENT: Bank… statements? I don't… I don't handle the money. She did. Always. She said I was… bad with numbers. I just… signed things. If she told me to. I don’t even know where the bank is. Or how to look at the statements. I can't… I can't do this. I just wanted to… go where she wanted to go. Now… now it’s all… too hard. She always made it so easy. And now… I’m just… lost. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand you’re grieving and feeling overwhelmed. However, your health is at stake. Look, I can’t ethically provide medical advice without more information. I strongly recommend you contact her family or a close friend who might have travel details. Perhaps they can locate her travel itinerary. If you absolutely cannot obtain this information, I advise postponing your trip until you can. Traveling to an unknown location without proper preparation could be… dangerous. And it would be… unwise. I’ll document our conversation. .
