DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it’s about my… well, my business. Been happenin’ for a few days now. Not pleasant, I’ll tell you that much. Blood in it, you see. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to get a fella worried. And at my age, one gets worried easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in your stool is definitely something we need to look into, especially given your age. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look into? What’s to look into? It’s blood, Doctor. Plain and simple. And it’s… well, it’s red. Bright red, mostly. Though one time… one time it was a bit darker. Like… old coffee grounds, I suppose. Not that I drink coffee, mind you. Nasty stuff. But that's what it reminded me of. And it doesn’t hurt, exactly, but… uncomfortable. A bit of strain, you know? Like I haven’t… emptied things completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood and sometimes darker, like coffee grounds... and you're experiencing some straining and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. That gives me a bit more information. When did you first notice this happening?
PATIENT: Now, let me think… It was… oh, goodness… must’ve been close to a week ago, maybe a little longer. Hard to keep track, you know? Days all blend together when you're… well, when you're my age. But I'd say around the first of August, give or take. I figured it was somethin’ I ate at first. Had a bit of that smoked salmon… maybe it didn’t agree with me. But it hasn't gone away, which is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Right, so it started around August 1st and hasn't resolved despite thinking it might be something you ate. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits other than the blood – like more frequent bowel movements, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation, mostly. Always been regular as clockwork, I have, but these last few days… it's like tryin’ to push a boulder uphill. And when I do manage it, it’s… well, not like usual. Smaller pieces. More… broken up. Not a solid, you know? Like… rabbit droppings, almost. Though I wouldn’t know a rabbit dropping if it bit me. Just makin’ a comparison.
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation with smaller, fragmented stools. And the blood… is it on the surface of the stool, mixed in, or around the anus?
PATIENT: Well, mostly on the paper, see? When I wipe. A bit of it streaks down the stool sometimes, but it's not in it, not really. And… well, I’ve had a little bit around the… area, if you catch my drift. A bit of irritation, you know? Nothing terrible, just… a little tender. Like a chapped bottom, almost. Though I haven't been doin’ any rough work, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, so blood on the paper after wiping, some streaking on the stool, and some anal irritation. Have you experienced any pain in your abdomen, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Abdomen… no, not really pain. A bit of rumblin’ sometimes, but that’s just old age, I expect. Nausea, no. I haven’t thrown up a thing, thankfully. And weight loss… well, I’ve always been a bit of a lightweight, if you get my meanin’. But I haven't noticed anythin' drastic. My trousers still fit, if that’s any consolation. Though they are gettin’ a bit loose, now that I think of it… But that’s probably just me shrinkin’, not anythin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Possible slight weight loss, but not significant. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Humph. Medical history. Don’t get me started. I was a pilot, you see. Spent years gettin’ checked over, poked and prodded. Always in good health, they said. Good as a horse. Though I always thought that was a bit of an exaggeration. I had a bit of trouble with my ticker years ago, needed a bit of… fussin’ with it. But that was decades ago. And I don’t even remember what they did, to be honest. As for other things… just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. Never had any of that diabetes or high blood pressure nonsense. I eat a sensible diet, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of some heart issues decades ago, but otherwise generally healthy. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Not a one. Never been one for pills, if I can help it. Give me a bit of fresh air and a good nap, and I’m right as rain. I used to take somethin' for my knees, years back, but that was a long time ago. Stopped workin’ for me, so I just stopped takin’ it. Waste of money, if you ask me. I might take a bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And not regularly, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional aspirin. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes, actually. Back in '68, I had my appendix taken out. Appendicitis, it was. Nasty business, I recall. And… hmm… I had a bit of a repair on my shoulder after a… well, after a bit of a mishap landin’ a Cessna. That was years ago, of course. And that's about it, as far as I can remember. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises a fella collects over a lifetime.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in '68 and a shoulder repair at some point. Now, regarding your family history - are there any relatives who have had issues with colon cancer, rectal cancer, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Well, now that's a tricky one. Family history... my mother's side, they didn't talk about such things. Very proper women, they were. My father... he was a sailor, spent most of his life at sea. Didn't see him much. I know my aunt Mildred had some sort of trouble with her stomach, years back, but I don't know what it was. And my cousin Harold… well, Harold wasn't quite right in the head, if you get my drift. Didn't pay much attention to his ailments, to be honest. So, no, not really. Can't say I know of any family history of that… that cancer business.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of colon or rectal cancer. Finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Used to, back in the war, when everyone did. But I quit years ago. Best thing I ever did. And alcohol… well, I used to enjoy a wee dram now and then, a bit of scotch. But that was decades ago. Haven't touched a drop in years. Makes me feel sluggish, see? And at my age, one needs to be sharp as a tack. So, no. Neither, Doctor. Not a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, thank you for that thorough history. Given your age, the blood in your stool, the changes in your bowel habits, and the feeling of incomplete evacuation, it's important we investigate this further. I’m going to need to do a physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I'll need to do a digital rectal exam. It’s not the most pleasant thing, but it's important for checking for any abnormalities. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: A… a what exam? Now hold on a minute, Doctor. I’ve been poked and prodded enough times in my life, thank you very much. And I’ll be frank with you, I’m not keen on havin’ anythin’… inserted. I’m an old man, Doctor. A bit of dignity, if you please. Surely there's another way? Perhaps a… a test, with a sample? I can provide a sample, if you like. But stickin’ things where the sun don't shine… that’s a bit much, even for a doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I absolutely respect your concerns. You’re right to ask about alternatives. A stool sample is a good start, and we will definitely do that to check for blood and other abnormalities. However, a digital rectal exam is an important part of evaluating your symptoms. It allows me to physically check for any masses, tenderness, or other problems that a stool sample won’t detect. It’s a quick exam, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. I can explain the procedure in more detail if that would help. It’s important to rule out anything serious, and unfortunately, this is the best way to do that. We can also discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist for further testing, like a colonoscopy, if that’s something you're comfortable with. But a colonoscopy is a more invasive procedure, and we'd want to have a better understanding of what's going on first. Would you be willing to reconsider the exam, knowing I will be as careful and respectful as possible?
PATIENT: Blast it all. Always somethin', isn't it? At my age, one expects a bit of wear and tear, but… that’s different. Fine, Doctor. Fine. But you better be gentle. And quick. And explain everything first. Don’t want any surprises. I’ve faced down storms over the Atlantic, but this… this is a different kind of ordeal altogether. Now, what exactly does this… exam involve? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Thank you for your willingness, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate it. It will only take a few moments, and I will explain every step. You’ll be lying on your side, and I'll be wearing a gloved and lubricated finger to gently insert it into your rectum. I’ll be feeling for any abnormalities, like lumps, tenderness, or signs of bleeding. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any pain, let me know immediately, and we’ll stop. I will also be checking for any external abnormalities around your anus. The entire process will likely take no more than a minute or two. Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns?
PATIENT: A minute or two, you say? Humph. Still doesn't make it pleasant. And what about… well, what about privacy? I don't want a parade of nurses gawking at my… rear end. And what if you find somethin'? Will you tell me right away? I don’t want to be left wonderin’, see? I’d rather know the worst, than be kept in the dark. And... is there a… a paper to sign? For this… invasion of privacy?
DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable questions, Mr. Rowbottom. You have every right to be concerned about privacy, and I assure you it will be fully respected. We will ensure you have complete privacy during the exam, and only I will be present. No nurses or other staff will be involved without your explicit consent. If I find anything concerning, I will tell you immediately. I’ll explain what I’ve found in plain language and discuss the next steps with you. We will work together to come up with a plan for further investigation and treatment. And yes, you are correct to ask about paperwork. We have a standard consent form for physical exams, which outlines the procedure and your rights. I will have you sign that before we proceed. Here's the form. Please take your time to read it over, and feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Once you’re comfortable, we can proceed. Before we get to that, would you like me to explain anything else about the exam?
PATIENT: …'Potential discomfort'… 'Risk of minor bleeding'… Blast it all, always a risk with these things. Alright, Doctor. I've read it. Seems… thorough enough. But I still don’t like it. No, I suppose there’s no avoidin’ it. Very well. Let's get it over with. But be quick, and be gentle, I warn you. And explain everything as you go. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. Thank you for signing the form. I understand your apprehension, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to have you lie on your side with your knees bent towards your chest. This will help relax your muscles. Then, I'll apply a small amount of lubricant to my gloved finger. I'll gently insert it into your rectum about an inch or two, just enough to feel for any abnormalities. I'll be checking for any lumps, tenderness, or signs of bleeding. I’ll also be checking the walls of your rectum for anything unusual. It may feel like you need to bear down, but try to relax as much as possible. If you feel any pain or discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we’ll stop. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. But don’t expect any fancy cooperation. Just get it over with. And quick. I haven’t got all day, you know. And for goodness sake, be gentle! This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Just try to relax. This will only take a moment. Okay. I’m feeling… the muscle tone seems normal. I do feel a slight tenderness on the left side, but it’s not significant. There are no obvious masses or lumps. I don’t feel any blood on my finger. The prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but that's common for men your age. Alright, that’s all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Blast it all. Not pleasant, I tell you. A bit of discomfort, alright. And… a bit of a chill. Just get it over with, you said. Well, what did you find? Don’t beat around the bush. Was it somethin’ serious? Or just… old age? And what about that… that prostate thing? Is that somethin’ I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. So, the good news is I didn't feel any obvious masses or lumps, and there wasn’t any blood on my finger. The tenderness I felt is likely just minor irritation, perhaps from straining, and shouldn't be a major concern. However, as I mentioned, your prostate does feel slightly enlarged. That’s very common for men your age, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. But it can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting or stopping, or a weak stream. To be on the safe side, I recommend a PSA blood test to get a better idea of your prostate health. It's a simple blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, which can be elevated in cases of prostate enlargement or prostate cancer. It's a screening test, so it won’t definitively diagnose anything, but it can help us determine if further investigation is needed. We should also do a urine sample to check for any infection or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: More tests? Blast it all. Always somethin', isn't it? A blood test… and a urine sample… Is there no end to this poking and prodding? A prostate… whatsit? Enlarged, you say? Is that… dangerous? Will I have to… have it removed? And what about that PSA thing? What does that even mean? I just wanted to know why I had a bit of blood in my… business. Now it’s turned into a whole medical saga.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom. It does feel like a lot, and I apologize for that. I assure you, we’re just trying to be thorough and rule out anything serious. To answer your questions, an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. Many men live with an enlarged prostate without any symptoms or complications. The PSA test helps us assess the risk of prostate cancer. A higher PSA level can indicate a higher risk, but it can also be elevated for other reasons, like an infection or BPH. That's why it's just a screening test and doesn't definitively diagnose anything. If your PSA level is elevated, we may recommend further testing, like a biopsy, to get a more accurate diagnosis. We are not talking about removal at this point. We are simply trying to gather more information to determine if any treatment is needed. For now, let's start with the blood test and the urine sample. We can discuss the results and then decide on the best course of action. Would you be willing to get those tests done?
PATIENT: Blast it all. Fine. Fine. Do the tests. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And explain everything clearly, mind you. I don't want any surprises. And if it turns out to be somethin' serious… well, I want to know my options. Don't sugarcoat it. Just tell me straight. And is there anything I should be doin' in the meantime? Anythin' I should be avoidin'? Or anythin' I should be… eatin'?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. I will explain everything clearly, and I promise to be straightforward with you. We'll discuss all your options if anything serious is found. For now, there are a few things you can do while we wait for the test results. Drink plenty of fluids – about eight glasses of water a day. That can help keep your urinary system healthy. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. And try to avoid straining during bowel movements. If you're constipated, you can try a mild stool softener or increase your fiber intake. I’m going to get you a requisition form for the blood test and a container for the urine sample. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve provided the samples, they'll send the results to me, and I'll contact you as soon as I have them. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… get it over with, you said. Right? Lab down the hall, blood and… and stuff. And then you’ll call. Fine. And Doctor… if this turns out to be somethin’… serious… don’t bother with flowery language. Just tell me what my options are. Straight. I’ve faced down worse storms than this, I assure you. Blast it all. Always somethin’…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. You take your time. And you’re right, I will be straightforward with you. I will explain all your options clearly and honestly. .
