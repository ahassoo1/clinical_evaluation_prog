DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello. Yes, hello Doctor. Is… Amussen, you say? Hmm. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Need to find a doctor, you know? Medicare said to come here. Social thing, I think. Not… sick. Just need to get checked, I guess. Old man problems, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, Kile. Welcome to the area, and welcome to the clinic. It’s good you’re being proactive about establishing care. So, even though you're not feeling sick, it sounds like you’d like a general check-up to get a baseline, and make sure everything's okay?
PATIENT: Baseline? Is that… like a starting point? Yes, yes, that sounds right. Starting point. Everything feels… okay. I do… paint faces, you know? For the theater. Lots of little things. Maybe that matters? Chemicals and such.
DOCTOR: Right, a starting point. Good way to put it. And yes, painting faces does matter – the chemicals could be relevant. Do you do this professionally, or as a hobby?
PATIENT: Professionally. Always professionally. For many years. Big productions, small productions… it is work. Not… playing. Very serious work. Need to make people look… beautiful. Or scary. Or old. Whatever the play needs. I use… many colors. And powders.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Professional face painting for many years. And you use a variety of colors and powders. We’ll definitely want to talk about that a bit more. Now, to get started, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? Hmm. Well… I eat. Sometimes. Drink tea. Lots of tea. Not much exercise, if I am honest. Old bones, you know? They don’t like running. Divorced, many years ago. Wife… didn't like the paint. Said it smelled bad. Is that… health information?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Diet, activity level, and even some of your life circumstances can be relevant. Let’s focus on your medical history for now. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That is… a long time ago. I remember… something about my stomach, when I was young. Very sick. But it went away. And… my father, he had… problems with his breathing. Old lungs, he said. But me? I think I am… okay. Never really went to the doctor much, if you want to know the truth. Too busy painting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stomach issues as a child that resolved, and a family history of lung problems. That's good to know. It's alright that you haven't been to the doctor much – we're starting now! Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not really. Sometimes, if my back hurts, I… rub something on it. A cream. From the store. Very strong smell. And… tea. Is tea a medication? It helps with everything, you know? Old Russian secret. But… nothing the doctor gives me. Never needed it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a topical cream for your back and tea – that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… No, I don't think so. I eat… everything. Well, almost everything. Sometimes the fish smells funny, but I eat it anyway. And… the paint. Sometimes makes my skin itchy. But that's… not an allergy, is it? It's the chemicals. I wear gloves now. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known drug or food allergies, some skin irritation from the paint – which you address with gloves, that’s good. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh, no. Never. Too busy. Too important. I had… a tooth pulled, when I was very young. But that’s not a hospital, is it? Just a… chair. And a man with sharp things. No hospitals. Never needed one.
DOCTOR: No hospitals, just a tooth pulled. Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family. Do you have any siblings?
PATIENT: Siblings? Yes. One sister. Very… difficult woman. Always complaining. She lives… far away. In Siberia, I think. Doesn’t paint faces. Sells… potatoes. Very boring life. We don’t speak much. Is this… important?
DOCTOR: That's alright to know. It's helpful to get a picture of your family history. Did your sister have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Problems? Oh, yes. Always problems. She had… something with her stomach. Very bad. In the hospital for a long time. And… her knees. Always complaining about her knees. Old age, I think. But… very dramatic. She makes everything sound worse than it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your sister had stomach issues and knee problems. Now, let's get a little bit of a physical assessment. Just a quick check of your vitals and a listen to your heart and lungs, okay?
PATIENT: Vitals? Is that… like important numbers? Fine, fine. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle. Old man, you know? And… don’t take too long. I have… things to do. Paint to buy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just sit here for me, please. I'm going to take your blood pressure first. Okay, your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: One forty over… what was that? Is that bad? My wife… she always worried about numbers. I never understood. Lungs are… old. Like I said. Lots of paint fumes over the years. Probably full of color.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90 is a little higher than we'd like to see, but it's not an immediate emergency. We'll want to monitor that. I do hear a little bit of wheezing in your lungs, and some crackles as well. This could be from the paint fumes, as you mentioned, but we should rule out other possibilities. I'm going to listen to your back now. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oof! Yes, a little. There. Old injury. Fell off a ladder, many years ago. Painting a very big… angel. Needed to reach the top. Angel didn't appreciate it. Back never the same. But… I can still paint. That's what matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some pain in your back from an old fall. Now, to get a better idea of what's going on with your lungs, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some basic blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Oh dear. Is that… necessary? I feel… fine. Mostly fine. I just moved here. I don't want to be poked and prodded. Can't we just… take some tea? And maybe lower the numbers? I'm sure it's nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Kile. But the wheezing and crackles in your lungs, combined with your history of paint exposure and the back pain, warrant further investigation. The X-ray will help us rule out any serious lung issues, and the blood work will give us a baseline of your overall health. It’s best to be thorough, especially as you're establishing care with a new doctor. Think of it as preventative, okay?
PATIENT: Preventative… hmm. You mean… stopping something bad before it happens? Fine. Fine, do your tests. But be quick about it. And… no sharp things, if possible. I hate needles. And… can I have a cup of tea afterwards? For my nerves?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can absolutely arrange a cup of tea afterwards. And I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. We'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department, and they'll let you know when they're ready for you. I’ll also have the nurse give you a list of instructions. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. Let me think… Yes. Is this… going to cost me a lot of money? My Medicare… it’s complicated. And… will the tests tell me if I need to stop painting? I don’t want to stop painting. It’s… everything.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Kile. Let's address the cost first. With Medicare, you should have coverage for these tests, but there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your plan. Our billing department can review your coverage and give you a more accurate estimate. As for the painting, the tests will help us determine if your paint exposure is affecting your lungs. If it is, we can discuss ways to minimize the risk, like wearing a respirator or switching to low-VOC paints. We certainly don't want you to stop painting unless it's absolutely necessary. It sounds very important to you, and we’ll work together to find a solution that keeps you healthy and able to continue doing what you love. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: Respirator? Is that… like a mask? I look silly enough as it is, covered in paint. Low-VOC… what was that? It sounds… complicated. This is all very stressful. I just wanted a doctor, not… a science project. And… will the tests make me tired? I have a very important angel to finish. Deadline, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Kile. A respirator is a mask that filters out harmful chemicals in the air – it’s a safety precaution. And yes, it might not be the most fashionable accessory, but your health is the priority. Low-VOC stands for low-volatile organic compounds. Basically, it means paints with fewer harmful chemicals. We can look at options together. As for the tests making you tired, the blood draw might leave you feeling a little lightheaded for a short time, but it shouldn’t cause any lasting fatigue. We can take things one step at a time. Let’s get the tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and develop a plan that works for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: One step at a time… Yes. I suppose that’s best. Fine. Tests. Then… tea. And then… angel. Please, no more science projects today. I need to… think about colors. And… wings.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kile. That sounds like a good plan. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and give you instructions for the chest X-ray. And then, tea. Is there anything else I can help you with before I leave?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just… hurry with the tea. And… tell the nurse to be gentle. Very gentle. My veins… they are old. Like everything else. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll make sure the nurse is aware. I’ll leave you to it then. The nurse should be in shortly.
