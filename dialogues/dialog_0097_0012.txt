DOCTOR: Hi Velda, lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Velda Squiers. I am here today because I am planning a cruise, you see, and the cruise line requires some… medical information before I can finalize the booking. It’s a bit of a bother, really, but I suppose it’s for the best. I just need a doctor to fill out a form for them, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Velda. That’s perfectly alright – many cruise lines do require that. Happy to help get that form filled out for you. It’s always good to be prepared. Before we get started on the form, though, let's just chat a bit about your overall health. Just to make sure I have a complete picture. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, ask away. I’m quite happy to answer anything I can. Though, I must admit, my memory isn’t what it used to be… but I can usually recall details if you prompt me. I do hope that won’t be a problem?
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Velda. I’m happy to prompt you as needed, that's perfectly fine. In fact, I have a pretty good memory myself, so we can work through this together. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Well, my late husband, bless his soul, always said I was a remarkably healthy woman. And, to be fair, I have been fortunate. I did have a rather nasty bout of pneumonia about fifteen years ago, and needed a stay in the hospital for that. But other than that… No, I don’t believe I have any long-term conditions. The doctor at the time said it was a one-off thing, brought on by a particularly bad winter. He did a lot of listening to my chest, I recall. And a chest X-ray, of course. Is that the sort of thing you were wanting to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I was wanting to know. Thank you for that information, Velda. Fifteen years ago with pneumonia is good to have noted. And were there any complications from the pneumonia, or any lingering effects you’ve noticed since then?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I was quite poorly for a few weeks, mind you – bedridden, and rather weak. But I made a full recovery, thank goodness. I did have a bit of a cough for a while afterwards, a sort of tickly cough, but it cleared up on its own. My husband, Robert, was wonderful during that time. He looked after me hand and foot. I don’t think I could have gotten through it without him. He made me a lot of tea with honey and lemon, I remember that vividly. And he insisted on keeping the house meticulously clean, to keep the germs away.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you had a wonderful husband, Velda. It’s good to hear you recovered well from the pneumonia. Now, thinking about surgeries, have you ever had any operations or surgical procedures done?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the one, really. Many years ago, when I was a young woman - about twenty-two, I think – I had my appendix removed. It was quite sudden, actually. I woke up one morning with a terrible pain in my stomach and my mother insisted we go to the doctor immediately. He said it was appendicitis and I needed to go into hospital right away. It was a fairly routine operation, I believe, and I recovered quickly. I was in hospital for about a week, I think. The nurses were very kind. And the food wasn’t too bad, considering.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Velda. Appendix removal when you were twenty-two. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother’s side of the family… Well, she had a sister, my Aunt Agnes, who suffered from arthritis quite badly in her later years. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life, I believe. And my father's side… He had a brother, Uncle George, who had heart problems. He had to have a pacemaker fitted, I remember that. It was quite a new thing at the time. He lived a good long life afterwards, though. He was a very active man, despite his heart trouble. He used to say, “Keep moving, Velda, that’s the secret!”
DOCTOR: Thank you, Velda. Arthritis in your Aunt Agnes and heart problems in your Uncle George are both useful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I live a fairly quiet life these days. I don’t do much strenuous activity, I’m afraid. I enjoy gardening, mostly. I have a small rose garden that I tend to. It’s very therapeutic, you know? And I enjoy reading. Mostly historical novels. I find them quite… absorbing. I don’t smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of sherry on special occasions. And I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruit and vegetables. Though I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, I must confess. I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Velda. A quiet life with gardening, reading, and a healthy diet—very good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take any medications at all. Never have, really, aside from a headache tablet now and again. And I don’t have any allergies, thankfully. Not to food, not to anything. I’ve always been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I remember once, a friend of mine had a terribly severe reaction to a bee sting. It was quite frightening. I’ve always been very careful to avoid bees and wasps, just in case.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Velda. No medications and no allergies—that’s very good to know. Right, that gives me a really good overview of your health. Now, just to complete things, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Though I warn you, my arm isn't terribly strong these days. Robert used to take my blood pressure, you know. He was always very good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: “No problem at all, Velda. We’ll take it nice and slow. It's just a routine check.” “Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not concerning given you’re a bit anxious about the cruise. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. A little diminished breath sounds on the bases, which is normal with age.” “Everything sounds good, Velda. Just a slightly elevated blood pressure, which is probably due to the excitement of the cruise. It’s good you're getting this checked before you go.” “Now, let's get this form filled out for the cruise line. Do you have it with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, Doctor. I am relieved. I did worry it might be something more serious. Yes, I do indeed. I brought it with me, just in case. It's a rather lengthy form, I must say. Here you are. I do hope it doesn't take you too long. I’m not terribly good at waiting around, you see. Though I am trying to be patient.
DOCTOR: "No worries at all, Velda. This isn’t too bad. Just some standard questions. It will just take me a few minutes to fill out. "Just confirming, you said no allergies to any medications and you're not currently taking anything, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Absolutely none. I've always been very fortunate in that regard, I must say. Robert used to tease me about it, said I was remarkably resilient. He’d try to get me to take a vitamin supplement, but I always refused. I said if I hadn’t needed anything all these years, there was no point in starting now. And he was right, of course. I’ve never needed anything.
DOCTOR: "There we are, all done. I've noted your good health, no medications or allergies, and the slightly elevated blood pressure. I've recommended you monitor it regularly when you return from your cruise." "Is there anything else I can help you with today, Velda?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. Yes, that all looks correct. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. Just the form, really. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and fill it out so efficiently. It’s a great weight off my mind now. I am looking forward to my cruise immensely. Perhaps I’ll send you a postcard!
DOCTOR: “That would be lovely, Velda. I hope you have a wonderful time. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns when you get back. And enjoy your cruise!” “It was a pleasure meeting you.” “Safe travels.”
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for all your help. Goodbye, and thank you once more. I shall certainly do my best to enjoy it!
