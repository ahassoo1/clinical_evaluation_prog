DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something to do with… checking things. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. They just told me I needed to come in for it. It’s… for work, maybe? Something like that. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. Well, let's try to piece this together. Work-related, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Something about… being sure I'm okay to operate the equipment. I drive the big rollers, you know? For paving. It’s… important they check, I guess. Is this a drug test? That’s what it feels like. I don't really… do anything, but they said something about it. Sorry, I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we wouldn't be conducting a simple drug test without a very specific reason, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like your employer has requested some baseline medical testing to ensure you are fit for duty. We need to establish a complete picture of your health before attributing anything to… concerns about operating machinery. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think… I was married for a long time, my husband passed away a few years back. And… I've got a bit of arthritis, I think? In my hands, mostly. It flares up sometimes. Other than that… honestly, I can't really recall anything major. I see the doctor for check-ups, of course, but nothing… serious, as far as I know. I'm on Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful to know. Arthritis, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, just in my hands. It doesn't stop me from working, thankfully. It’s just a little stiff sometimes, especially in the cold. I take some… pills for it, I think? Little white ones. I really don’t pay much attention to the names, my daughter handles all that now. She's very organized, unlike me! Is this test because of my arthritis? Would that stop me from… driving the rollers? I need that job, you know.
DOCTOR: It's highly unlikely your arthritis would prevent you from operating machinery, Ms. Hughston. However, we need a full picture. Let's clarify the medication. Do you recall when you started taking these pills?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When… that's tricky. It’s been a few years, at least. Maybe five? Or longer? It was after my husband… well, after he passed, things got a bit blurry. My daughter started managing everything then. She’s a lifesaver, truly. I think the doctor prescribed them, but honestly, I don't remember the appointment. I just take them when my hands are hurting, you know? Is that bad? Should I be remembering this stuff? I apologize, I'm really not trying to be difficult.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it's helpful to have accurate information. Do you know the dosage of these pills?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I haven't the faintest idea. They're little, white… round, I think? Maybe two or three at a time? I really wouldn't know. I just take what my daughter gives me. She tells me how many, and when. She gets everything filled at the pharmacy down the street, the one near the bakery. I truly apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more help. My memory… it's just not what it used to be. Is there someone I can call to help with this? Perhaps my daughter, Marie? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That would be… preferable. Do you have her phone number readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I do. Let me see… Here it is. 555-123-4567. That’s Marie’s number. She’ll be able to tell you everything. She’s a wonderful girl, very responsible. I'm just… a bit lost sometimes, you see? Hopefully, she can fill in the gaps. Is this test going to take long? I have to get back to work, if I can. The crew is waiting, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will attempt to reach your daughter. In the meantime, let’s perform a brief physical exam to get a baseline assessment. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. Have you had any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision… well, everything’s a little blurry these days, if I’m honest. I wear glasses, you see? And I think my hearing isn’t as good as it used to be, either. I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves. It’s just… age, I suppose. Nothing drastic, just… getting older. Is that a problem for the test? Should I have gotten new glasses? I apologize, I never think about these things. It's just Marie handles all that, bless her heart. She’s a very practical girl.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, while I appreciate your candor, it’s… difficult to establish a clear medical picture when information is so vague. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, a deep breath… Is everything alright, Doctor? It feels a little tight in my chest sometimes, but it’s probably just… nerves. I get nervous about tests, you see. I don’t like doctors much. No offense, of course. You seem very… thorough. Is this going to hurt? My daughter always tells me to ask questions. She said it's important.
DOCTOR: I’m hearing some… slight wheezing. Do you experience shortness of breath, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, um… sometimes. Not often, but… especially when it’s cold, or if I’ve been walking uphill. I just… slow down, you see? And take my time. I haven’t really told anyone about it, though. It’s not usually very bad. Is that… serious? Should I be worried? I'm starting to feel a little anxious now, Doctor. I didn’t mean to cause any trouble. Is this going to affect my job? I need that job, you know? The insurance is important. And the work… it keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, given your history of shortness of breath and the wheezing I’m hearing, I’m concerned about the possibility of underlying respiratory issues. Operating heavy machinery requires a certain level of physical exertion. It would be irresponsible to allow you to continue without further investigation. I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. We’ll need to rule out conditions like asthma or COPD. .
PATIENT: Oh dear. A chest X-ray? And… a pulmonary function test? That sounds… scary. I don’t like tests. And I really need to get back to work. The crew… they’re counting on me. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just… take it easy? I’ve always been able to handle it. I just slow down when I need to. I don’t want to lose my job. This is all very upsetting. I think I need to sit down. And maybe call Marie.
