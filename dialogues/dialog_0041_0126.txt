DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been… exceptionally thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s rather bothersome, to be honest. It feels like I can’t quite quench either, no matter how much I drink or eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, exceptionally thirsty and hungry… and it doesn't really seem to be helping, even with increased intake. Right. Hmm. And when did you first start noticing this, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s been… perhaps three or four weeks now? It started gradually, I suppose. I initially put it down to the warmer weather, naturally. But it hasn't lessened, even with cooler evenings. It’s become… constant. A bit unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four weeks, started gradually. Constant now. Alright. Besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? That’s a good question. Not that I've actively looked for any, to be frank. Now that you mention it… I suppose I've been visiting the lavatory a bit more often, if that counts. And I'm a little more tired than usual, I think. But that could be anything, couldn’t it? I do work long shifts.
DOCTOR: Yes, those could be a lot of things. Frequent urination and fatigue... okay. And just to clarify – how much more often are we talking about with the urination?
PATIENT: Well, I usually only need to go… once or twice before work, and once or twice during my shift. Now, it’s closer to… every couple of hours, I'd say. It's definitely not a normal pattern for me. And it's not painful, just… more frequent. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything, if that’s what you were wondering.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the lack of pain or blood. Okay. Let's see… frequent urination, increased thirst and hunger, fatigue... Just out of curiosity, have you noticed any changes in your vision, perhaps blurriness or difficulty focusing?
PATIENT: That's… actually, now that you bring it up… yes. It's subtle, but things haven’t been quite as crisp as they used to be. I thought it was just the strain of reading reports for long periods, but perhaps it's related? I haven't mentioned it to anyone before, to be honest. I haven't needed new glasses recently, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle changes in vision… that’s another piece of the puzzle. I'm starting to get a bit of an idea here, but let's just run through some more things to be thorough. Any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a difficult one. I haven’t actively been trying to lose weight. But I think my trousers might be a little looser than they were. It's not significant, but noticeable. I haven't weighed myself, to be perfectly honest. I’ve been rather preoccupied with work, and… well, all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible slight weight loss. Okay. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. I've never been diagnosed with anything, and I have a fairly clean bill of health, as far as I know. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I had a routine check-up last year, and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, routine check-up normal last year. That's good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never had the need for surgery, thankfully. I’m fairly careful, and avoid risky activities. Nothing of that nature in my history, no. Just the occasional bump and bruise from work, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother had high blood pressure, as I recall, and my father suffered from arthritis in his later years. But nothing… major. No history of diabetes that I’m aware of, and certainly nothing that I've been warned about specifically. Both have passed away now, unfortunately. I'm an only child, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, father with arthritis, no known diabetes. Right. And finally, any medications you’re currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any regular medication. I prefer to avoid it if possible, honestly. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, but that's all. I try to keep as healthy as possible, and rely on rest when I can. I haven’t been taking any vitamins or supplements either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Alright, Christen, thank you for that thorough rundown. It’s helpful to get the full picture. At this point, given your symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, slight weight loss, and changes in vision – it could be a few things. But the most likely possibility, based on what you’ve told me, is diabetes. I want to run some blood tests to confirm this. It's a simple procedure, and it will give us a definitive answer. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Diabetes… oh. Well, that’s… concerning. It runs in my wife’s family, actually, so it wouldn’t entirely surprise me, I suppose. Blood tests, yes, of course. If that's what's needed to get to the bottom of this, then yes, absolutely. The sooner we know, the better, I always say. What does that entail, exactly? Is it a lot of blood? I’m not terribly fond of needles, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a lot of blood, Christen. We’ll just need a small sample, drawn from your arm. It will be a quick prick, and it's usually over with before you know it. We'll primarily be checking your blood glucose levels, both fasting and after a meal, to see how your body is processing sugar. It's standard procedure, and our phlebotomist is very skilled. Let me just quickly access your EHR information to confirm your height and weight – 170cm and 93kg, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. 170cm and 93kg. It’s been a bit of a struggle keeping the weight down, I must admit. A bit of a weakness for biscuits, if I'm being honest. But let’s not dwell on that. Yes, the blood tests. Shall we proceed with that now? Is there anything I need to prepare for beforehand? I’ve got a shift starting in a few hours, so I don’t want to be… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Alright, height and weight confirmed. Yes, let's proceed with the blood tests. You don’t need to prepare anything specific, Christen. Fasting isn't necessary, which is good given your shift. However, it’s best to avoid sugary drinks or a large meal immediately before the test – just have a light snack if you’re feeling hungry. Our phlebotomist, Susan, is just down the hall, in room three. She’ll explain everything to you, and it won’t take long. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss them with you. It usually takes about an hour or two for the results to be ready. Do you have any questions before you head down?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just a light snack, and head to room three. An hour or two, you say. That should be manageable. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I shall go and find Susan, then. Hopefully, it won't be too unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Christen. And don't worry, it's usually very quick and painless. We’ll be in touch soon with the results. .
