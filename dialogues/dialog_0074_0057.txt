DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s about the cancer. I… I was told to come see you. It’s been a little hard to keep track of everything, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a lot to process, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. It sounds like you've recently received some concerning news. To help me understand what’s going on and how best to support you, could you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: They said… they said it was in my lung. And… and that it had spread. I don’t… I don’t really know what that means, exactly. My husband… he used to explain things, but… he’s gone now. So it’s just… confusing.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing someone you rely on makes everything harder, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling confused right now. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. When we say cancer has “spread,” it means the cancer cells have moved from where they originally started – in this case, your lung – to other parts of the body. To get a better picture of where it has spread and how much, do you have access to any reports from the tests that were done?
PATIENT: Reports…? I think… I think they sent some stuff to my house. Lots of papers. I haven’t… I haven’t really looked at them. Honestly, it scared me a little, and I just put them in a pile. I have Medicare, so I figured they would explain everything if it was really important.
DOCTOR: That's very common, Chellsea. It’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed and avoid looking at things that feel frightening. We can go through those reports together, or I can request them directly from the hospital or clinic where you had the testing done. Would you prefer I try to obtain the reports for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I don’t even know where to begin with all those papers, and I’m afraid I’ll miss something important.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m glad we can do that for you. While those records are being pulled up, let’s talk a little bit about how you’ve been feeling physically. Have you been experiencing any symptoms – things like shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, fatigue, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired easily. Very easily. Even just walking to the mailbox. And I cough sometimes, but I thought that was just… a normal cough. Nothing too bad. My appetite hasn't been very good either. I've lost a little weight, I think. It's hard to tell, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, a cough, and decreased appetite with some weight loss. These can all be associated with cancer, but they can also be caused by many other things. It's good you're sharing this with me. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history…? Let me think… I haven't really been sick much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was little. And… and my husband, he was sick for a long time before he passed. But that wasn't me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, tonsillectomy, and no other significant medical history of your own. And your husband’s illness was separate. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No. Just my tonsils. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My mom passed away when I was young. I didn’t know my father. And my husband’s family… I wasn’t very close to them. I don’t really know if anyone else had cancer. I think… I think my grandmother on my mom’s side might have, but I’m not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. It’s common not to have a complete family medical history. We can leave that for now. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago. I always told him it was bad for him.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I don’t drink. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, and finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. So, no known allergies. Now, while we're waiting for those records to become available, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will help me get a better sense of your overall health. I'll listen to your lungs, check your lymph nodes, and do a general assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be wonderful. We’ll start by listening to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me when I ask. I’m listening to your lungs now. I’m hearing some decreased breath sounds on the lower left side, and a few crackles. That doesn't necessarily mean anything definitive at this point, but it's something we'll want to investigate further. I will also palpate your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged in your left armpit and neck. Again, this isn't necessarily cause for immediate alarm, as many things can cause swollen lymph nodes, but it warrants further investigation. I'm also noting your weight, which is 112 pounds. I will document all of these findings now.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… concerning. What does it mean?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Chellsea. It’s natural to feel worried when you hear things like that. What it means is that we need to gather more information to understand what's going on. The decreased breath sounds and enlarged lymph nodes could be related to the cancer we discussed, but they can also be caused by infections, inflammation, or other conditions. The good news is that we've already started the process of getting your records so we can review the previous test results. Once those are available, we'll have a much clearer picture. At that point, we may need to order some additional tests, such as a CT scan or a biopsy, to confirm a diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. More tests… that’s… a lot. I’m just… scared. I don’t want to go through all of that. My husband… he was sick for so long. I don't want that.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be scared, Chellsea. And I want you to know that you are not alone in this. We will take things one step at a time, and I will be here to support you every step of the way. We'll discuss all of your options, and we'll make the best decisions together. Right now, let's focus on getting those records reviewed. While we wait, I want to assure you that even if it is cancer, there have been many advancements in treatment, and many people live full and active lives with a cancer diagnosis. We'll explore all of those possibilities when we have more information. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… not right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining things. And for… being kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. My pleasure. I'll let you know as soon as your records become available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. I'll be right back with the information on how to schedule a follow-up appointment. .
