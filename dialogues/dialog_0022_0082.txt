DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. Yeah. I… travel. I need… something for travel. My wife… she liked to travel. Before… you know. Now I go. For her. It’s… important. I think I need… shots? For travel? Somewhere far.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. I understand. It sounds like you're planning a trip, and you're thinking about vaccinations. That's very responsible of you. Just to be clear, are you thinking of a specific country or region you’ll be visiting?
PATIENT: Specific? No. Not really. Just… away. Far away. She always liked the warm places. Islands, maybe? I don’t… I don’t remember exactly where she wanted to go next. It doesn’t matter, right? If it’s warm, the shots are the same?
DOCTOR: I see. It's understandable that details are difficult right now. Unfortunately, the vaccinations needed do depend on where you're traveling. Different regions have different risks of certain diseases. To make sure you're properly protected, we need to figure out where you’re planning to go, even if it’s just a general area. Do you have any brochures or a general idea of the continents or countries you might consider?
PATIENT: Continents? Look, I just… need what she would have gotten. She always did all the planning. I just… went. She’d tell me what the doctor said, and I’d get it. I don’t… I don’t know about continents. Is… is there a shot for everything? I don’t want to forget anything. That would be… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed, and that’s completely understandable. We can definitely figure this out together. It's good you're thinking ahead about staying protected. Since you're not sure of a specific destination, let’s start broadly. Do you know what part of the world your wife usually traveled to?
PATIENT: Usually…? She liked… Asia. I think. Or maybe… Africa? Somewhere hot, with… lots of colors. And markets. She loved the markets. We went to a lot of markets. I… I can’t remember which ones. Does it matter? Just… the hot places. Are there different shots for hot places and… cold places?
DOCTOR: Okay, Asia and Africa are good starting points. And yes, there are different recommendations depending on the region. To help me narrow down the possibilities, and to give you the most accurate recommendations, can you recall any specific countries she mentioned wanting to visit, even if it was just in passing?
PATIENT: Countries… She talked about… Nepal. She said she wanted to see the mountains. And… Thailand? She liked the food in Thailand. Or was that Vietnam? They all look the same, you know? Lots of… rice. And temples. I… I really don’t remember. She had a map. A big map with lots of pins. But… I don’t know where it is now.
DOCTOR: Nepal and Thailand are excellent. That gives us a good place to start. Let's focus on those two for now. Okay, for both Nepal and Thailand, we generally recommend vaccinations against Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Tetanus is also important, if you haven’t had a booster in the last 10 years. We should also discuss Malaria prevention, as it’s a risk in certain areas of both countries. Do you know if you’ve had any vaccinations recently, or have a record of your previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Record…? No. She kept all that. She was… organized. I… I haven't been to a doctor in years. Not since… well. She always took care of it. I don’t think I had anything recently. Maybe… a flu shot? A long time ago. I don’t remember. Is… is it bad that I don’t remember? Should I? I feel… stupid.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright that you don't remember, Odell. It's completely understandable, especially given everything you've been through. It’s not about being "stupid" at all. We’ll just treat it as if you haven’t had any recent vaccinations and go from there. To be on the safe side, we'll start with a series of vaccinations. Since you'll be traveling to areas with a risk of Malaria, we’ll also discuss preventative medication. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh… not that I know of. She always asked me, but… I never had anything. I eat everything. I… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But… wait. Once, I ate some peanuts… and my tongue felt funny. But that was a long time ago. And maybe it was something else. I don’t know. She’d always ask if I felt itchy, or… or swollen. I never did. I… I think I’m okay. Do peanuts count? I don't want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you mentioned the peanuts. Even a mild reaction is important to know. We’ll note a possible peanut sensitivity. It’s good we’re being thorough. To start, we'll do the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations. These are given as a series, so you’ll need two shots, spaced several weeks apart. I’ll also write you a prescription for a Malaria preventative medication. It's important to start taking this a few days before you travel, and continue it for a few weeks after you return. Before we get started, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Blood pressure…? Is… is that important? If I’m going to get shots…? She always said I was… healthy. I didn’t need much. Just… the shots. But… okay. If you think it’s important. But… are you sure I need all these things? It feels… like a lot. Just for a trip. She made it seem so easy.
DOCTOR: It's good to be cautious, Odell. Checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs is just a routine part of a travel consultation. It helps me make sure you’re fit for travel and can handle the vaccinations safely. It’s true, it can feel like a lot, but it’s better to be prepared. We’re just taking the necessary steps to protect your health while you’re abroad. She sounds like she was very organized and proactive about your healthcare. We're just continuing that, ensuring you're well-protected. If you're comfortable, let's start with a quick physical exam. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay. If you think it’s necessary. But… please be quick. I… I don’t like doctors. She always made it… fast. Just the quick poke, and then we’d go. But… okay. Let’s just get it over with. Where do I… sit? Or lie down? I… I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table. We'll just take a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. You can lie back if you’re more comfortable. It really won’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let's just take a look at your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. My arm…? Which one? It doesn’t matter, right? They’re both the same. Just… don’t poke me too hard. She always had a gentle touch. I… I don’t like needles. I never got used to them. But… I’ll try. Just… be quick. Please.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Odell. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I understand your nervousness about needles; many people feel the same way. It's perfectly normal. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths. This might feel a little tight, but it won’t hurt. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s a little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs for a moment. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: It feels… tight. Like it’s squeezing. Is… is that normal? I’m trying to breathe. I… I don’t like this. She always made it… easy. Just a quick squeeze, and then it was over. I… I can’t relax. I’m too nervous. Is… is there something wrong? My heart feels… fast. Like it’s going to jump out of my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It’s alright. It sounds like you’re feeling quite anxious, and that’s perfectly understandable. Your heart rate is a little elevated, likely due to your nervousness. I’m going to take a moment to explain everything I’m doing and why, and we can go as slowly as you need to. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and safe. I’m listening for any unusual sounds in your heart and lungs, which would indicate any underlying health issues. Everything sounds clear at the moment, but your anxiety is making it a little harder to assess. Before we continue with the vaccinations, would you like me to take a moment to help you calm down?
PATIENT: Calm down…? I… I don’t know how. She always knew what to say. She’d… she’d hold my hand and tell me it was okay. But she’s… gone. I… I just want it to be over. But I’m scared. Really scared. Is… is there something wrong with my heart? You said it was fast. That means something is wrong, right? I knew I shouldn’t have come. I just… I wanted to honor her. But I’m making a mess of everything.
DOCTOR: Odell, it’s alright to feel scared. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious in this situation, especially given everything you've been through. And you are not making a mess of anything. You’re being incredibly brave by coming here and taking care of your health, even when it’s difficult. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that’s almost certainly due to your anxiety. I can feel your tension, and that's very common in situations like this. I'm not detecting any unusual sounds in your heart or lungs, so I don't believe there's anything to be concerned about at this moment. How about we take a few deep breaths together?
PATIENT: Deep breaths…? I… I can’t. It feels… like I’m suffocating. Like there’s a weight on my chest. She… she would hold my hand. And tell me to breathe slowly. But she’s not here. I… I don’t know what to do. I just… I want to go home. This is too much. Too scary. Please… can I just go home? I’ll… I’ll figure it out. I always do. But not today. Not here.
DOCTOR: Odell, it’s alright. You are absolutely right to listen to your body. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, it’s perfectly okay to stop. We can absolutely postpone this for another day, or even reschedule with another doctor if you’d prefer. Your comfort and well-being are the most important thing. Let's forget about the vaccinations for now. How about we just talk for a bit?
PATIENT: Talk…? About what? She… she always did all the talking. I just… listened. I don’t… I don’t know what to say. I don’t have any stories. Or… or anything interesting to talk about. Just… travel. And… her. But I can’t… I can’t talk about her. It’s too painful. I… I just want to go home. Please. Can I just go home now?
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. Absolutely. You’ve been through a lot today, and it’s perfectly alright to want to go home. Let’s get you checked out. I’ll write a note for your records, and we can reschedule for another day when you’re feeling more comfortable. There's no rush, and we can take things at your own pace. Remember, taking care of yourself is the most important thing. And I'm here whenever you're ready to continue. Let’s head out, and I’ll have the nurse escort you to the front desk.
