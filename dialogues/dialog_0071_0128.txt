DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… my joints, mostly. They’re just… stiff in the mornings, you know? Not bad bad, just… old. It takes a while to get moving, that’s all. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It’s been a while though.
DOCTOR: Hmm, stiffness in the mornings… alright. And how long does that stiffness typically last, Lilliana?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. A couple of hours, maybe? Sometimes less if I really get going. Other days… feels like all day. Honestly, it's hard to say. I just try to ignore it, mostly. It’s just… what happens when you get older, right?
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Now, is this stiffness in all your joints, or are some worse than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hands are the worst, I think. And my knees. Those make a bit of a noise when I bend them too, but it’s just… a creak. My shoulders bother me a little, but not as much as the hands. Everything feels a bit… achy, really, but the hands are the main problem. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. And have you noticed any swelling in those hands, Lilliana?
PATIENT: Swelling? I… I don’t think so. Not really. They feel a bit… thicker sometimes, maybe? But I don't know if that’s swelling. I have… well, I’ve always had bigger hands, you know? It’s hard to tell. I haven’t noticed them being noticeably puffy or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, has anything specific made this worse, or better?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Um… well, cold weather definitely makes it worse. My hands get really stiff then. And… being still, I think. If I sit for too long. Getting up and moving around helps, always. But… I don't know of anything that makes it better, exactly. Just… less worse. Is that a good answer?
DOCTOR: That's a very good answer, Lilliana. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me see. I get tired, of course. But everyone gets tired, right? And sometimes… I feel a bit achy all over, but that might just be getting old, too. I don't know. I haven't really noticed anything specific. I just feel… old and creaky, if that makes sense. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I don’t know if that’s connected. Is there something I should be feeling?
DOCTOR: No, no, that's perfectly alright. We're just trying to get a full picture here. Now, have you had any fevers, any weight loss, or noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Fevers? No, not that I recall. I don't get sick very often. Weight loss… I might have lost a little, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Honestly, I haven’t really been paying attention. Changes in my skin… well, it’s getting older, like everything else. A few more spots, maybe? Nothing major. I really don’t think so. I just… don’t know. It all feels the same to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover all bases, have you had any previous injuries to your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… I think I twisted my knee when I was younger, a long time ago. Playing volleyball. Nothing serious, though. It healed fine. And… I might have bumped my hands a few times over the years, doing… things. Gardening, mostly. But nothing that needed a doctor, you know? Just little bumps and scrapes. Nothing major, I promise. I'm not very accident-prone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. I don't take much, really. Just… sometimes something for a headache. And… I think I had a cream once, a long time ago, but I don't remember what it was for. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. But I don't take much, so… I'm not really sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that's a hard one. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. And my father… he had trouble with his joints when he got older, too. Like me. But I don't really know what it was. They didn't really talk about it much. And I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in years… I don't really know much about my family's medical history, I'm afraid. It wasn’t really a thing we discussed.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle… do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I've never smoked a day in my life. And I don't really drink. Just a little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Maybe once a week. It helps me relax. But that's it. I'm not a big drinker at all. I prefer tea, honestly. Much better for you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what kind of work do you do, or have you done in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I used to work with children. A long time ago. Daycare, mostly. Now… not so much. I help out sometimes, with my grandkids, but that’s it. It’s a good job, when you can do it. But it’s hard work. Lots of bending and lifting. I think that’s probably why my joints are the way they are. It’s alright, though. I enjoyed it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Lilliana, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to take a closer look at those joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… be gentle, okay? My hands are a bit sensitive. But yes, go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be. Now, if you could just extend your arms for me… Alright, let’s start with your hands. Can you open and close your hands for me, like you’re making a fist?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It feels a little stiff… There… Is that okay? It doesn't go as far as it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is some mild limitation in range of motion, and a little bit of tenderness to the touch. No obvious swelling or redness. And how about this hand?
PATIENT: It’s about the same, I think. Maybe a little bit more stiff on this side… It feels a bit… achy. Not bad, just… there. It’s just getting old, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s a similar degree of stiffness and tenderness on this side as well. I do notice a bit of crepitus – a sort of grating sensation – when you move your fingers. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you please sit back and extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It feels a bit… tight. I don't bend them as much as I used to. There’s a bit of a noise when I bend them, you know? A little… creak. Like that. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do hear some crepitus, as you mentioned. There’s a bit of tenderness along the joint line on both knees, and the range of motion is slightly limited. No significant swelling or redness. And how does this knee feel?
PATIENT: About the same, I think. A bit tight… and a little bit achy. The noise is a bit louder on this side, maybe? It's just… old age, isn't it? I've always been a bit creaky.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some crepitus and tenderness on this side as well, slightly more pronounced than the other knee. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. Thank you, Lilliana. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis – also known as wear and tear arthritis. It’s very common, especially as we get older. It’s not a cure, unfortunately, but we can manage the symptoms and help you maintain your quality of life. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… arthritis. That sounds… serious. Wear and tear… I guess that makes sense. All those years with children. Manage the symptoms… what does that mean? Will I be able to… still do things? And… is there anything I can do about it? Besides just… letting it wear away?
DOCTOR: It can be a bit daunting to hear, I understand. But “serious” doesn’t necessarily mean debilitating. And while there isn’t a cure, it’s very manageable, and we’ll work together to keep you doing the things you enjoy. Managing the symptoms involves a few different approaches. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – things like regular, low-impact exercise, like walking or swimming, to strengthen the muscles around your joints. Losing even a little bit of weight can also help reduce stress on those joints. We can also explore over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain and inflammation. And if those aren’t enough, we can discuss other options, like prescription medications or physical therapy. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… Exercise… I used to walk a lot, but I haven’t been doing much lately. Losing weight… I suppose that would help. I’ve put on a few pounds since I retired. Over-the-counter… I have some ibuprofen at home, for headaches. Prescription medications… I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. And physical therapy… what does that involve? Will it be painful? I just want to be able to keep up with my grandkids. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication. We'll definitely start with the least invasive options first, and we’ll only consider other treatments if necessary. Physical therapy involves exercises designed to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It's not usually painful, but it can be a little uncomfortable at first. The therapist will tailor the exercises to your specific needs and abilities, and they'll gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. And it's not just about exercises. They’ll also teach you techniques to protect your joints and manage your symptoms. Now, I'd like to order some blood tests just to rule out other potential causes of your joint pain, like rheumatoid arthritis. It’s just a precaution. And I'm going to give you a prescription for a low dose of ibuprofen. You can start taking that as needed for pain relief. And I’ll give you a referral to a physical therapist. Would you like me to also write a note for your primary care doctor so they are aware of my findings?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… okay. Blood tests… alright, if you think it’s necessary. Ibuprofen… I’ll try that. A physical therapist… what do I need to do? Do I just call them? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. A note for my primary care doctor… yes, that would be good. I haven't seen her in a while. Will this… stop it from getting worse? Even if it's just a little bit?
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood tests are just a precaution to rule out other possibilities. And the ibuprofen should help manage the pain and inflammation in the meantime. For the physical therapist, I’ll give you a referral with their contact information. You just need to call them and schedule an appointment. They’ll take it from there. Now, as for stopping it from getting worse… unfortunately, there’s no way to completely stop the progression of osteoarthritis. But with a combination of lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, and medication, we can significantly slow it down and manage your symptoms. It's about keeping you active and comfortable for as long as possible. I’ll also give you some information on osteoarthritis, so you can learn more about it on your own. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good to know, I think. Slow it down… that’s all I ask. No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate your help. I think I’ll go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, take things slow, and listen to your body. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the referral for the physical therapist and some information about osteoarthritis. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. Goodbye.
