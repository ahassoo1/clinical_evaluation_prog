DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bacy. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month – the 15th of September, to be exact – and the cruise line requires a form completed by a doctor. Just some medical information, you understand. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. A pre-cruise medical form. I can certainly help with that. Let me pull up the standard form the cruise lines use… Alright, I see it here. To start, and to fill this out accurately, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’ve generally been quite well, thank you. I'm 45 years old, and I don’t really have any major complaints. I walk most days – about a mile, usually – and I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea. I lost my husband a few years back, and that was difficult, but I’m managing. I wouldn't say I've been ill, as such, in a very long time. Just the usual little aches and pains you get with getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally well, Velda, and that you're staying active. It's wonderful you’re able to get a mile of walking in regularly. I’m sorry to hear about your husband; losing a loved one is always difficult. Okay, let's get some specifics for the form. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything. I’ve had the usual colds, of course, and a touch of the flu now and again, but nothing that required a visit to the doctor. I did have my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was many years ago. My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart in her later years, but I haven’t experienced anything similar, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No major diagnoses. Tonsillectomy as a child, that’s helpful to know. And a family history of heart issues with your mother – we’ll make a note of that. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, not a single one, Doctor. I prefer to avoid them if I can. I believe in letting nature take its course, you see. I might take a paracetamol now and again for a headache, but that’s it. And a bit of cod liver oil in the winter, for the vitamin D, but that’s more of a habit than anything else. My husband always said I was a bit stubborn about taking pills!
DOCTOR: Well, that’s perfectly alright, Velda. It’s good to know your preferences. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I've never been stung by a bee or a wasp that caused me any trouble. I might get a bit of a sniffle around cats, but that’s just a mild irritation, not a proper allergy, I don’t think. Just a bit of a tickle in my nose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, no known allergies. Just a mild sensitivity to cats, that's helpful to know. And finally, before we do a quick physical exam, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the tonsils, Doctor, as I mentioned earlier. That was when I was a child, of course. A very long time ago. Apart from that, nothing. No broken bones, no stitches, no nothing. I've always been quite careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. Just the tonsillectomy as a child. Now, to complete the form accurately, I'd like to do a brief physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. I understand that’s just standard procedure. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to stay still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within a normal range. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look clear as well. And just a quick look at your throat… Your throat looks healthy; no signs of inflammation. Everything sounds and looks good, Velda. I’m going to make a note of these findings on the form.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. I’m glad to hear everything is as it should be. I knew I felt alright. Is there anything else you need to know before you complete the form?
DOCTOR: Not at the moment, Velda. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, there are no immediate concerns. I'm completing the pre-cruise medical form now. Here you go. It’s a standard form, and it just confirms that you’ve had a medical assessment and are generally fit for travel. I’ve noted that you have no known allergies, no chronic medical conditions, and that your vital signs are normal. Please read through it to make sure everything is correct, and then you can take this with you to the cruise line. Do you have any questions about the form or anything we discussed today?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. Thank you very much, Doctor. Yes, that all looks correct. Everything is as it should be. No, I don’t think I have any questions, thank you. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to do this for me. It puts my mind at ease before the cruise. How much do I owe you?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Since you don’t have insurance, the cost of the visit is \$125. You can pay at the reception desk on your way out. Have a wonderful time on your cruise! Do be sure to stay hydrated and wear sunscreen. And if you experience any sudden or concerning symptoms while traveling, please seek medical attention immediately.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you to remind me. I will certainly do that. I appreciate your advice, and your care. I’ll go and pay at the desk now. Goodbye.
