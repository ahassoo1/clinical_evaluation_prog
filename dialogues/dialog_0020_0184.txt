DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day, you understand? I'm here 'cause... well, look in the mirror. I'm gettin' old, skin hangin' everywhere. It's…disgustin'. I want somethin' done about it. Don't need a long explanation, really. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about changes you're seeing with your skin as you age. While I appreciate you being direct, Mr. Trendler, it's helpful for me to understand exactly what's bothering you, and how long these changes have been occurring. "Skin hanging everywhere" can mean a lot of different things. Could you tell me more specifically what areas you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Areas? Really now? You need me to tell you? Look at my neck! It's like a turkey wattle. And my arms… flabby, just flabby. Been happenin' for… oh, I dunno… maybe five years? Longer. It just keeps gettin’ worse. Honestly, I used to be… strong. Now? I look like a dried-up mango. You got somethin' that can tighten this up or what? I ain't lookin’ for a lecture on growin' old.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I understand. You’re concerned about loose skin on your neck and arms, and that these changes have been developing over at least five years. And you’re looking for ways to address them. To get a better understanding of your options, and to make sure we approach this safely, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Thyroid? What kinda question is that? No! I don't have nothin' like that. I used to work hard, pile drivin', you hear? Strong work. Kept me fit. Always been healthy, until… well, until I started fallin' apart. Look, are you gonna help me or just ask questions all day? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no diabetes or thyroid issues. That’s good to know. And you were previously very active with pile driving. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Energy? What’s that? I tire easy now, you see? Used to work all day, no problem. Now I need a nap after just walkin' to the mailbox. Appetite's… okay. I eat. Don’t go starvin' or nothin'. But I ain’t got the same pep as before, that's for sure. You keep askin' about things I don’t have, are you tryin’ to find somethin’ wrong with me?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Trendler, I'm not trying to find something wrong with you. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your overall health before we discuss potential options. Fatigue can sometimes be related to other factors that might influence the best course of action. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No! I don't take nothin'. Never have. I believe in strong work and good food, not pills. Supplements? What are you, tryin’ to sell me somethin’? Just tell me what can be done about the skin. I don't need to hear about vitamins and all that nonsense. This is gettin' ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Trendler, to get a better understanding of the skin changes you're describing, would you mind if I took a quick look at your neck and arms?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes. Yes, look at it. Just get on with it. Don't need a lot of fuss. And be quick about it, I haven't got all day. I got a fish to fry, you understand? Literally. A red snapper. Needs attendin' to. Now, hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I'm just going to gently feel and examine the skin on your neck and arms. I'm noting some degree of skin laxity, which is common with age, and a decrease in elasticity. There's no apparent rash or discoloration. I’m also noting some mild thinning of the skin. Now, this is just a preliminary assessment. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, there are a few options we can consider, but it's important to understand what each involves. Before we get into those, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? No! I eat everything. Never had a problem. I'm a Jamaican man, you think I'm gonna be worried about allergies? I eat spicy peppers, ackee, everything. Look, just tell me what can be done. And don't try to sell me fancy creams or somethin’. I want somethin’ that works. Like a good strong machine, not some weak lotion. I ain't got time for messin’ around. Is there somethin' you can do, or not? This is gettin' long.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. Mr. Trendler, there are a few options, but it's important to understand they all come with potential risks and benefits, and none are a "quick fix”. We could discuss surgical options like a neck lift or arm lift, which offer the most significant improvement but also involve anesthesia and a recovery period. Alternatively, there are non-surgical options like radiofrequency skin tightening, which are less invasive but offer more subtle results and require multiple sessions. Another option would be to consult with a dermatologist about laser resurfacing. Given your age and health history, I would recommend a thorough cardiac evaluation before considering any surgical procedure. Would you be interested in learning more about any of these options?
PATIENT: Cardiac evaluation? Look, are you tryin’ to scare me now? I’m fine! I may be old, but I’m still strong. I don't need to be poked and prodded by a heart doctor just to get some saggy skin fixed. Honestly, this is… ridiculous. I came here for a simple fix, not a whole medical workup. Is there somethin' simple you can do? Like… a strong bandage, or somethin'? Something that tightens it up? No surgery, no heart doctors, no fancy lasers. Just… somethin’ practical. Otherwise, I’m wastin’ my time. Stop.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, there isn't a "simple fix" for significant skin laxity. Bandages or creams won’t provide the results you’re looking for, and attempting procedures without a full evaluation could be unsafe. Given your concerns about surgery and further testing, I would recommend consulting with a dermatologist. They specialize in skin conditions and may have other non-surgical options available that could be suitable for you. I can provide you with a referral if you’d like. I also want to emphasize that I’m prioritizing your safety, and proceeding without a proper assessment wouldn’t be responsible medical care. .
