DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed and… verified, I guess. They’re health forms, and I need a notary to look them over. I hope that’s something you can do? I’d really like to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. I can certainly take a look at those forms for you and verify them as a healthcare provider. I can also act as a notary public, yes. Before we begin, may I just confirm your date of birth for the record?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's a relief. Let me see… it’s October 12th, 1948. Yes, 1948. It feels strange saying that number out loud sometimes!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Melvenia. October 12th, 1948… noted. Now, regarding these health forms, are they for a specific purpose?
PATIENT: Yes, they are. It’s for… a volunteer position, actually. I’m trying to volunteer at the local animal shelter. They require these forms, and a signature from a doctor, to make sure I’m healthy enough to handle the animals. It's a bit silly, really, at my age, but I want to help. Do you need to know what kind of volunteering? It's mostly just cleaning and… socializing with the cats.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Melvenia! It’s never silly to want to help others, and volunteering is a very admirable thing to do. Knowing what the role entails is helpful. Cleaning and socializing with cats… that gives me a better idea of what to look for. Before I sign, I'd like to ask a few standard questions, just to get a clear picture of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. Let's just get this done, please. I have an appointment later this afternoon. I’m not wanting to hold you up.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your time is valuable. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, the arthritis in my hands has gotten worse over the years, definitely. And the doctor said my cholesterol was a little high last time I had a check-up, but he didn't put me on any medicine for it. Otherwise… not really. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Do you need details? I can’t remember everything exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the hands and slightly elevated cholesterol. That’s good to know. Regarding the arthritis, do you experience any pain or limitations in your daily activities because of it?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Mostly in the mornings, and when it’s cold. Makes it hard to open jars sometimes, and… well, typing, actually. That’s why I prefer talking to people, if I can. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it's… annoying. I mostly just use some cream and try not to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some pain and stiffness in the mornings, worsened by cold temperatures, affecting your hands, and impacting activities like typing. You manage it with topical cream. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, goodness, maybe twenty years ago? It was a pretty simple surgery, recovered quickly. And… I think that’s it. Nothing else major. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was young, but that doesn't count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, wisdom teeth removal doesn’t typically need to be listed. Just the gallbladder removal. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for the arthritis, if it’s really bothering me. That's it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in years. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but that wasn't me. I'm pretty lucky, really. I think I’ve told you, I'm generally quite healthy. Do you need me to list everything I haven’t been allergic to? Because that would take a while!
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary, Melvenia! No known allergies is perfectly fine. Now, just a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do any close family members – parents, siblings, children – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had a heart attack when he was older. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. My brother is healthy as a horse, always has been. It’s funny, the way things work, isn’t it? I don’t seem to have inherited much from either of them. Are you writing all this down? I hope it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am making notes, Melvenia. Don't worry, it's not trouble at all. This information helps me get a complete picture. So, mother with high blood pressure, father with a heart attack. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Always hated the smell. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. It's a terrible habit. I've always been careful about my health, as much as I can. I hope that shows. Can we just get to the signing now? I’m starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I just have a couple more quick questions, and then we can proceed with the forms. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, and never more than one glass. It's… relaxing. I'm not a big drinker, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, I'm more of a tea person. Can we please move on now? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Finally, do you have any current symptoms, like pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath, that you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the arthritis in my hands, like we discussed. Otherwise, I feel fine. Really. I’m a bit tired of answering questions, if I’m honest, but that’s not a symptom, is it? Look, I appreciate you taking the time to do this, I really do. But can we just get to the signing? I have an appointment this afternoon and I'm worried about being late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. I understand completely. Alright, let's take a look at these forms. Now, just to confirm, you're volunteering at the local animal shelter, primarily cleaning and socializing with cats?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Cleaning and socializing. Mostly cats. I just want to make sure everything’s in order so I can start helping. Can we just sign it? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Everything looks good. Based on our conversation today, I have no contraindications to your volunteering. If you could just sign here and initial here, and I will sign and date as a healthcare provider. After this, I can notarize them for you. Do you have a photo ID with you?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Finally! Here you go. And yes, I have my driver's license right here in my purse. I hope this is the last step!
DOCTOR: Excellent. There you are, Melvenia. All completed and notarized. I wish you all the best with your volunteering. It sounds like a wonderful way to spend your time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. No, that’s all. I think that’s everything. I really appreciate your help. And thank you again for not making me feel silly about volunteering at my age. I hope you have a nice day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. It was my pleasure. And please, don't ever feel silly about wanting to contribute to your community. You have a wonderful day as well, and enjoy your time with the cats! If you have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment.
