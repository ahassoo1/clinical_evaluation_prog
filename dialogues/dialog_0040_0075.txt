DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Paske, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Moshe Paske. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Osga, is it? I believe I read your name on the door. A lovely clinic you have here, very peaceful.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not get sidetracked. You’re 83, if I’m reading this correctly. That's… advanced. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, yes, 83 years young! But to be serious, it’s this daytime sleepiness. Even with the machine, the one I use at night… I just feel so tired during the day. It’s making things difficult, you know? I try to keep busy, but… it’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: Daytime sleepiness… and you’re using a machine…CPAP, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. CPAP. My… ex-wife was the one who really pushed for it, to be honest. She was always very good about my health. It does help when I'm sleeping, I think. I don't wake up quite as…gasping as I used to. But like I said, it doesn’t seem to be enough to keep me awake all day. Do you need me to explain any of that? I sometimes ramble.
DOCTOR: No, no. I understand. CPAP… often a band-aid solution. How long have you been using it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… almost ten years now. Maybe eleven? It was right after the sleep study, of course. Dr. Feldman – a lovely man, though retired now – he’s the one who diagnosed me. He insisted I start right away. It was a bit difficult getting used to, but I persevered. Why do you ask? Is that… normal, that it doesn’t fix everything?
DOCTOR: Normal?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose “normal” isn’t the right word. I just mean… I thought if I was using the machine correctly, it should solve the problem. It’s frustrating to still be feeling so tired after all this time. Is there something wrong with the machine, perhaps? Or am I not using it right? I’ve tried to be diligent, I really have.
DOCTOR: Let me see… adherence… variable. That figures. Look, many things can cause daytime sleepiness. It’s rarely just one thing, and sometimes, it’s… well, it’s simply age. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Age, you say? Well, I have noticed a few things, naturally. But it’s hard to say what’s related to being 83 and what isn’t! Let me think… I get a bit forgetful sometimes, but that's always been the case, truthfully. And my knees aren’t what they used to be. But other than that… Hmm. I suppose I feel a little… down, sometimes. Not terribly sad, just… less enthusiastic than I used to be. Is that relevant? And I do wake up feeling a bit… dry in the mouth, even with the humidifier on the machine.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness… dry mouth… okay. Any weight changes recently?
PATIENT: Weight changes? Not really, no. I've always been a bit… stout, shall we say. I try to watch what I eat, but I do enjoy a good meal. I’ve probably lost a little weight over the last few months, but nothing drastic. Maybe a pound or two? It's hard to keep track, to be honest. I weigh myself occasionally, but not regularly. Is that important? Should I be?
DOCTOR: It's always important to monitor weight. Now, let's do a quick exam. Just a quick look. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs... can you follow simple instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can follow instructions just fine. I may be 83, but I'm not… incapacitated, if that’s what you’re implying. Blood pressure, pulse, lungs… yes, go right ahead. I'm quite used to doctor’s visits, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated – 148/92. Pulse is regular, 78. Lungs are clear… for now. Throat looks a little dry. Let me have a look at your feet. Any swelling?
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, to be honest. My doctor back in Miami warned me about it. Swelling? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. They feel a little… achy, sometimes, especially in the evenings. But no visible swelling, I don’t think. Do you see anything? They are a bit red, perhaps. Is that normal for someone my age?
DOCTOR: Redness is... not ideal. Look, I'm going to order some basic blood work. Check your thyroid, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. It could be a number of things, frankly. Age, medication, thyroid… or something else. We'll rule things out. I’ll also send you to a specialist to re-evaluate your sleep apnea. This CPAP isn’t a guaranteed fix, and frankly, it sounds like it isn’t working as well as it should.
PATIENT: Oh. A specialist, you say? Well, that sounds… involved. But I suppose if that’s what’s necessary. What kind of specialist? Someone who deals with… the machine? And the blood work, is that going to be painful? I don’t like needles very much. And about the sleep study… will I have to go back to the hospital? I don't have much family nearby to help me with that. I understand you're busy, doctor, but this is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s a pulmonologist. They deal with lungs and breathing. The blood work is a small prick, you won’t even feel it. Honestly. And yes, you’ll likely have to repeat the sleep study. It’s standard procedure. It's not ideal, but it's necessary. I’m going to write you a referral and the lab orders. My nurse will explain everything. Now, are there any other complaints?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist… right. Well, that’s… good to know. And a sleep study again… It's just… a lot. Let me see… Other complaints… Hmm. Sometimes, I wake up with a bit of a headache. Not terrible, but… persistent. And my hands feel… numb sometimes, especially in the mornings. But I assumed that was just from sleeping wrong. Is that something I should mention? Or is it best to just focus on the tiredness for now?
DOCTOR: Headaches, numb hands… everything is connected. Let’s get these tests done and then we can decide what’s happening. The nurse will schedule the appointments. Is there anything else, or can I get on with my day?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that’s everything. The nurse will explain about the appointments… Very well. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate your time. .
