DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s good to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, well, honestly? I don't have a lot of time. I just... want to get pregnant. Simple as that. My husband… well, he was my husband… and we always planned on kids, but things didn’t work out. Now I’m… older. And I don’t want any problems, you know? I just want it to happen. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Carmaleta. It’s very common to want to ensure a smooth path to pregnancy, especially as we get older. I understand you’re concerned about potential problems, and we'll definitely address those. To get a better understanding of your situation, would you mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… don't make it a whole interrogation, alright? I’m not good with remembering details. And honestly, talking about this makes me a bit… uneasy. Just the basics, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. Just the basics. We'll go at your pace. No pressure at all. Let’s start with your menstrual cycle. Are your periods regular?
PATIENT: Regular? Honestly… I haven’t really paid attention, not since… well, not for a while. They come, I guess? I mean, I haven’t been keeping track. Is that bad? I just… didn’t think I needed to, until now. It’s all a bit of a blur, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Many people don't routinely track their cycles unless they are trying to conceive or have a specific concern. It's not bad at all; it just means we’ll need to gather a bit more information. Roughly, how often do you get your period – would you say every month, every few months, or is it quite irregular?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is what I mean! Irregular, I suppose. It’s not like clockwork. Sometimes closer together, sometimes… longer. Honestly, I couldn’t even give you a number. Maybe every six weeks? Eight? I really don’t know. It's been… unpredictable. And stressful, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like your cycles are somewhat unpredictable. That’s something we can investigate. Now, have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. That’s… that’s part of why I’m here, isn’t it? It’s not like I have a history to go on. It just… never happened. And now I’m worried it won’t happen. It feels like time is… slipping away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Carmaleta. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. We'll do everything we can to explore the possibilities and address your worries. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies… no, not that I know of. I’m pretty healthy, generally. I eat alright, I try to walk… nothing major. Medical conditions… no. Not really. I had a bit of trouble with my… well, nevermind. It’s nothing important. Just… old age creeping up, I suppose. I don’t take any pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You mentioned a bit of trouble with something – if you feel comfortable sharing, even a little bit, it might be helpful. If not, that’s perfectly alright too. We can always circle back to it later. Just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly, this is a lot of questions. Fine. I had my gallbladder removed… years ago. Like, a long time ago. Maybe ten years? More? I don’t remember exactly. It was… unpleasant, but I recovered fine. It’s not like it’s relevant, is it? I mean, it’s not like my gallbladder has anything to do with getting pregnant!
DOCTOR: It’s good to know, Carmaleta. You're right, it’s unlikely to be directly related, but we ask about all past surgeries as part of a complete medical history. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – your mother, sisters, aunts – has had trouble getting pregnant, or experienced early menopause?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Honestly, I wasn’t close to my mother. And my sisters… well, we didn’t really talk about that sort of thing. I know my aunt Beatrice had… some problems, I think? But I don't know what problems. Everyone always whispered, but I never asked. It was just… awkward. So, no, not really. I don't have much information, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Carmaleta. It’s common to not have a complete family medical history. We can work with what we have. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you interrogating me now? No! Absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And I certainly don't do… that sort of thing. I'm a respectable woman! Honestly, I find this line of questioning a bit… insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions came across as intrusive, Carmaleta. It’s not my intention to offend you. These are standard questions we ask to get a complete picture of your health, and to identify any potential factors that might affect your ability to conceive. To move forward, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if you are comfortable with that. It will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. We can also do a pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Really? Now? I was hoping to get this over with quickly. Fine, alright. Get it over with. But don't take too long, alright? I have things to do. And please, be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. We’ll take things at your pace, and I will be as gentle as possible. If you'll just get comfortable on the table, we can start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within the normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the pelvic exam. This will allow me to assess your uterus, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. It may cause some mild discomfort, but I’ll do my best to minimize it. Do I have your consent to proceed?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright, alright. Just get it over with. I suppose. Yes, go ahead. But hurry, please. This is… unsettling. And please, be careful. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta, I’m going to start by inserting a speculum to visualize your cervix. You may feel some pressure. Your cervix appears normal. There’s no obvious sign of inflammation or abnormalities. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your uterus and ovaries to assess their size and shape. Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries are… slightly enlarged, but there are no palpable masses. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it could be indicative of polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. I’ll give you a moment to get dressed. Based on your history and the physical exam, the slightly enlarged ovaries raise the possibility of PCOS. To confirm this, I would like to order some blood tests to check your hormone levels. We may also consider an ultrasound to visualize your ovaries and uterus in more detail. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, PCOS? What even is that? Another thing wrong with me? Honestly, this is just getting worse and worse. Blood tests… an ultrasound… More waiting, more appointments… Fine, alright. Do whatever you think is necessary. Just… tell me what it means. And don’t use a lot of medical jargon, alright? I’m not a doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed right now. PCOS, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a common hormonal disorder in women of reproductive age. It can cause irregular periods, difficulty getting pregnant, and other symptoms. The "cysts" are actually small follicles on the ovaries, which can sometimes interfere with ovulation. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something wrong with you, it just means your hormones might be a little out of balance. It’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication, if necessary. The blood tests will help us determine your hormone levels and confirm whether or not you have PCOS. The ultrasound will give us a better look at your ovaries and uterus. I’ll order those tests for you now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding or severe abdominal pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. A week. More waiting. Fine. Just… get it over with. And please, send me the information about this… PCOS thing. I want to read about it myself. I don't trust everything doctors say, if you don’t mind me saying so. And… thank you. I suppose. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I completely understand your desire to be informed and do your own research. I'll have the nurse send you some information about PCOS, including reputable websites and resources. We also have pamphlets here at the clinic if you'd prefer a physical copy. I want to assure you that I'm here to answer any questions you have, and to work with you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if something comes up before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the lab requisition for your blood tests. The nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule them. I’ll see you in a week. In the meantime, try not to stress too much. And remember, you're not alone in this. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just… get me out of here. This has been… draining. Thank you… for trying, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I understand. I'll have the nurse escort you to the exit. Please take care of yourself, and remember, we're here if you need us. Have a good day.
