DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my mom, she… she had a lot of trouble with her heart. And my brother, he had some problems with… with his head, you know? Thinking and stuff. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises, if you know what I mean. Just peace of mind, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. It sounds like you’re concerned about potential heart issues and cognitive function, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Heart… and the thinking. It scares me a little, to be honest. I feel okay now, but… you never know, do you? My mom, she didn’t feel bad until… well, until it was too late. I don't want that.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to be thoughtful about it. It’s always better to be prepared. We can certainly do some things to assess your current health and give you some peace of mind. Let’s start with a little more detail about how you are feeling right now. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No chest pain, no. And I can breathe okay, I think. Energy… hmm. Sometimes I get tired quicker than I used to, but I’m… I’m seventy-three, you know? Maybe that’s just old age. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now… I need a little rest sometimes in the afternoon. It’s not bad, just… different. I still get around, though. I still do things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Schwer. It's good you’re able to still be active. Fatigue can certainly be a sign of many things, and it's helpful to know you're noticing a change. Now, thinking… you mentioned being concerned about that. Have you noticed any memory problems?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I forget things. Little things. Where I put my glasses. What I went to the store for. Things like that. Nothing… big. But it happens more than it used to. My daughter keeps telling me I need to write things down. She says I repeat myself sometimes too. I don’t always remember repeating myself! It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that it's frustrating, Mr. Schwer. Those little things can be worrisome. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about how these memory issues affect your daily life?
PATIENT: Hmm. Daily life… Well, I still cook for myself. I still watch the news. I still go to the store, even if I forget what I need sometimes. I used to be really good at puzzles, you know? Crosswords and Sudoku. Now… I have trouble concentrating. I get… distracted easier. It takes me longer to finish them. I don't do them as much anymore. I don’t want to… you know… I don’t want to get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you’re very aware of these changes, and that’s excellent. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a few times, a bad cold here and there. And my back bothers me sometimes, old age, I guess. The doctor gave me some pills for it a few years ago, but I don’t take them much. They didn’t really help. Other than that… nothing serious. I try to eat right. I try to get some exercise. I'm not perfect, but I try.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. Taking care of yourself is important. And any history, even minor things, is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don't think so. Maybe when I was a little boy, but I don't remember it. My mom said I had my tonsils out, but I was so young. Nothing as an adult. No, definitely no surgeries. I’m pretty sure. I would remember that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would, yes. It’s good you’re thinking so clearly. Okay, let’s talk about your family history a little more. You mentioned your mother had heart trouble, and your brother had issues with thinking. Do you know anything more specific about those conditions?
PATIENT: My mom… she had a bad heart, they said. She was always tired. And she got short of breath easily. She ended up in the hospital a lot. They did something to her heart, I think, but it didn't help. She died when I was… oh, maybe fifty? Something like that. And my brother… he just got… confused. He forgot things. He couldn't take care of himself anymore. He was in a home for a long time before… before he passed. I don’t know what kind of doctor he saw. My sister handled all that. It was sad.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear that, Mr. Schwer. Those are difficult experiences. And it’s helpful to know this family history. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I don't think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. My daughter asked me that once, and I told her no. No allergies. I don't have any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy or anything like that either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my back sometimes. Like I said, they don’t really help, so I don’t take them much. And I take a vitamin D pill in the winter. My daughter says I need it. Other than that… no. No medications. No supplements. Maybe an aspirin now and then if I have a headache. But that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and memory. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if anything… hurts. I'm a little worried, but I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, just relax for me. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds… I hear a slight murmur, but it’s not terribly concerning at this point. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a little memory test. I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after I say them, and then I'll ask you to remember those words later. Ready?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. Three words? Okay. Go ahead. I hope I can remember them…
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… and… penny. Is that right? I’m trying really hard… I think that’s them.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Schwer! Very good. Now, let’s move on to a few other quick checks. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your cognitive function. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… It’s… 2025. Is that right? August… the second? I think so. It's hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: That is correct! Excellent. And do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Well, I'm in the doctor's office, aren't I? In… a rural area, you said? I think it was a small town. Is that what you wanted to know? I'm not always sure what you're asking! It’s frustrating…
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious during these tests. You are right, we are in a rural clinic. Now, one last simple question. Can you tell me who the current president is?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a tough one. I watch the news, but I forget things so easily… Let me think… Is it… Biden? Joe Biden? I think that’s right. But I could be wrong. I hope I'm right… It's so confusing these days.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Mr. Schwer! Very good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This will just involve tapping on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but not overly concerning at this point. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some mild cognitive decline, which is not uncommon at your age, and some fatigue. Your heart murmur is a minor finding that warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh… cognitive decline? That sounds… bad. Is that… is that dementia? My brother… did he have that? And the heart… is it serious? Am I going to… need surgery? Please tell me I don't need surgery.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, please don’t worry. Cognitive decline doesn’t automatically mean dementia. It simply means there’s been a slight decrease in your cognitive function, which can be caused by a number of things, including age, stress, and minor medical issues. We need to do some further testing to determine the cause. Regarding your heart murmur, it's also not necessarily serious. It could be a benign finding, or it could indicate a minor valve issue. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'm not anticipating surgery at this point, but we need to gather more information before we can make any definitive conclusions. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An EKG… and a blood test? Okay. That sounds… a little scary. But I guess it’s better to know. What about… what about my memory? Is there anything I can do to help it? My daughter keeps telling me to do puzzles, but I just… I just get frustrated. Is there a pill I can take? Or something? Anything?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, Mr. Schwer. And that’s a very good question about your memory. There are several things you can do to help improve your cognitive function. Puzzles are good, but it’s important to find activities that you enjoy and that aren't too stressful. Gentle exercise, a healthy diet, and staying socially active can all make a difference. There are some medications that can help with memory loss, but they are typically reserved for more severe cases of dementia. At this point, given your mild cognitive decline, I wouldn't recommend medication. We can focus on lifestyle changes and see if that helps. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. They can perform more detailed testing and provide a more accurate diagnosis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? That sounds… serious. Is that someone who… specializes in brains? I don’t want to be told I’m… I’m losing my mind. But… I guess if you think it's best… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… promise me you'll explain everything. And don’t tell me I need surgery! This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, it’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the nervous system, which includes the brain. Seeing a neurologist doesn’t mean you’re losing your mind at all. It simply means we're getting a more thorough assessment of your cognitive function. I promise I will explain everything clearly and answer all of your questions. And I understand your concern about surgery – based on the information we have now, I do not anticipate that being necessary. I’m going to order the EKG and blood tests for today. I will also prepare a referral for a neurologist. Once we have the results of the tests and the neurologist’s assessment, we can develop a plan to address your concerns. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Tests and a neurologist. I guess… I guess that sounds okay. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… where do I go for the neurologist? And what if… what if it's bad?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schwer. The EKG and blood test results should be back within a few days, typically three to five business days. I’ll call you as soon as they're available. As for the neurologist, I’m referring you to Dr. Emily Carter. Her office is located at 123 Main Street, here in town. The phone number is 555-1234. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. And regarding your concern about the results… I understand your worry. It’s important to remember that we’re gathering information to help us understand what’s going on. Even if the results aren’t what we hope for, there are many things we can do to manage your condition and improve your quality of life. I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll face this together, and we’ll develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient. I'm still scared, but… I feel a little better knowing what's going on. I guess I'll go home now and… wait for the phone to ring. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We're here for you.
