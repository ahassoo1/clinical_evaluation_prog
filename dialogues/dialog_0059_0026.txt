DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Chagarís, you say? That’s… a name. Well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… dreadful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it comes, it really comes. Makes it hard to do anything. My husband keeps saying I need to slow down, but honestly, what is slowing down at this point? I used to be able to work all day, you know. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving – that is demanding work! It’s good to know that about your past activity level. So, this tiredness… you said it comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about when it started, and what it feels like when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That’s… a good question. Honestly, I don’t rightly remember. A few months, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur these days. When it’s bad… well, everything just aches. My muscles, mostly. Like I’ve been lifting weights all day, even when I haven’t. And I just… can’t. Can’t seem to get off the sofa. It’s very frustrating. My husband, Tenzin, he does most of the cooking when I’m like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite debilitating when it’s at its worst. And it’s good that Tenzin is able to help you out. Just to clarify, when you say “aches,” is it all over your body, or are there specific areas that are worse than others?
PATIENT: Specific areas… hmm. My legs, mostly. And my back. Lower back, to be precise. Sometimes my arms feel weak too, but that’s not as often. It’s not like a sharp pain, Doctor, more of a… heavy feeling. Like they’re filled with lead. And they’re always stiff. Terribly stiff. Makes it hard to get up and down, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Stiffness and a heavy feeling in your legs and lower back, more frequent than in your arms. Do you notice anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse… well, being cold doesn’t help. Definitely doesn’t help. And… I don’t know. Just… using them, I suppose. Trying to do things. Walking too much. Standing for long periods. Better… not much, honestly. Resting, I guess. But even resting doesn’t always fix it. It just… comes and goes on its own. It’s very unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and muscle aches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! Sometimes my urine is a bit… dark. Darker than usual, I mean. And I’ve been a bit more thirsty than normal, I suppose. But I always drink a lot of water, so I didn’t really pay much attention to it. Other than that… not that I can recall. I’ve been eating alright, I think. Tenzin makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark urine and increased thirst, along with the tiredness, muscle aches, and stiffness. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about any past medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… oh dear. That’s a long list. Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago. And my hips replaced, both of them. That was… a while back now. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered from that. Other than that… I’m usually quite healthy, you know. Always have been. Commercial diving keeps you in shape, surprisingly enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, both hips replaced, and a history of pneumonia. That’s good to know. Do you recall approximately when you had each of those procedures?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m terrible with dates. The gallbladder, that was… probably in the nineties? A long time ago. The hips… one was around 2010, I think. And the other one a couple of years after that. Maybe 2012? Something like that. I don’t keep track of these things, Doctor. Tenzin usually remembers all that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. We can always verify those dates with your medical records. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the usual things for an old lady, you know. Something for my blood pressure. A little pill every morning. And a vitamin D supplement, because Tenzin says I don’t get enough sun. And… oh, sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for blood pressure, vitamin D, and something for arthritis as needed. Do you happen to know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Names… now you’re asking a hard question. The blood pressure one… it’s a little white pill. That’s all I know. I don’t bother with the names, Tenzin fills the prescription and makes sure I take them. The arthritis one… it’s yellow, I think. And I only take it when my joints are really bothering me. Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to Tenzin. He’s very good with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. It sounds like Tenzin is a great support to you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, you know. Tenzin makes wonderful curries, very spicy ones sometimes, and I enjoy them just fine. No allergies to dust or pollen either, I don’t sneeze any more than the average person. No, I can’t think of any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and examine your legs and back to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle with my back, alright? It’s been a bit sensitive lately. And don’t mind if I wince a bit. It’s just… old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished at the bases. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical throughout. Now, if you could just point to where you’re feeling the most discomfort in your legs and back… There’s tenderness to palpation in the lumbar spine, particularly around L4-L5. No signs of acute injury. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities, but there's some mild discomfort with range of motion in the lumbar spine. Alright, Ardelle. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some muscle strain or arthritis-related pain in your lower back. The tiredness and dark urine are a little more concerning, though. I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and vitamin D levels, as well as a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please don't take too much blood, alright? I get a bit faint sometimes. And… what about the tiredness? Do you think it’s just… old age? It’s just so debilitating when it hits. I hate feeling like this.
DOCTOR: We'll take just the necessary amount of blood, Ardelle, and I'll make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. As for the tiredness, it’s unlikely to be just old age. There are many potential causes, and that's why the blood tests are important. We need to rule out things like kidney problems, vitamin deficiencies, or underlying infection. It could also be related to the arthritis pain, as chronic pain can be very exhausting. We'll get a clearer picture once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your pain. Would you like a referral to a physical therapist to help with your back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical therapist… hmm. I don’t know. I don’t really like being poked and prodded. Tenzin might like that idea, he’s always telling me to exercise more. But honestly, Doctor, I’m just hoping it’s nothing serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, you know. I just want to be able to get through the day without feeling completely exhausted.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ardelle. We’ll take things at your pace. A physical therapist could offer some gentle exercises and stretches to help with your back pain and improve your overall strength and flexibility, but it’s entirely your decision. For now, let's focus on getting those blood test results back. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage your back discomfort while we wait. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A pain reliever would be good, thank you. And… could you explain the blood tests a bit more? What exactly are you looking for? I don’t understand all the medical jargon. I just want to know if it’s something serious, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’m happy to explain. The blood tests are really just a way for us to get a more detailed picture of what’s going on inside your body. We’re going to check your kidney function, because sometimes tiredness and dark urine can be signs of kidney problems. We’ll also look at your electrolyte levels – things like sodium and potassium – because imbalances can cause fatigue and weakness. And we'll check your vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can also lead to tiredness and muscle aches. We're also doing a complete blood count, which tells us about the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets – to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. Essentially, we're trying to rule out any serious medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything wrong, but it’s best to be thorough. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… complicated. Anemia… isn’t that something people with… low iron get? I eat plenty of meat, I think. And infection… I haven’t been sick in ages. You don’t think it’s… anything bad, do you, Doctor? I just want to get back to my garden. Tenzin keeps saying I need to slow down, but I enjoy it so much.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ardelle, anemia often involves low iron, but it can have other causes as well. And you’re also right to point out that you haven’t been sick recently – that’s good news. It’s important to remember that these tests are just a precaution, and it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything bad going on. We’re simply ruling out potential causes for your symptoms. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and come up with a plan together. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. I’ll write you a referral to the lab, and they’ll schedule an appointment for you. It will likely be just a simple blood draw. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… a blood draw. Yes, that sounds… manageable. And you promise you’ll explain everything clearly when the results come back? I don’t understand all those medical terms, you know. And… could you possibly write down the name of the lab, just in case I forget? I’m a bit forgetful these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I absolutely promise to explain everything clearly, in plain language. No medical jargon, I assure you. And yes, let me write down the name and address of the lab for you. Here you go. It’s called “Sunshine Labs,” and the address is 123 Main Street. The phone number is 555-1234. They’re very good there, and the phlebotomists are very gentle. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever called acetaminophen. You can take two tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for your back pain. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once we have the lab results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Acetaminophen… I think I’ve heard of that. And a follow-up appointment… yes, that’s good. It’s good to know you’re taking this seriously, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And… thank you for being patient with me. I’m not the easiest patient, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t worry about being a difficult patient. You’re asking excellent questions, and it’s important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. We'll get to the bottom of this together. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Now, do you need any assistance getting to the door?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thank you, Doctor. I can manage. Just a bit slow these days. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little better just knowing you’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
