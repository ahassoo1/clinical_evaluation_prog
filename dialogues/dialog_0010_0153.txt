DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh, right. The… performance thing. They sent me here for a check-up, I think. Something about needing to be cleared for… acting? Or a show? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I mostly just show people to their seats, you know? Lobby work.
DOCTOR: Alright, a check-up related to performance work. So, you’re involved in the production side of things, assisting with seating arrangements, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s… that’s the gist of it. Ushers, tickets… mostly standing around a lot. And pointing. Not exactly strenuous work, Doctor. I hope this doesn’t take too long, if it’s just for that.
DOCTOR: I understand. We just want to make sure everything is in good working order, especially given the physical demands of… well, being on your feet and directing people. Even seemingly easy jobs can have hidden stressors. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you've noticed any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, my knees ache a little more than they used to, I suppose. But that’s just getting old, isn’t it? And… I forget things now and then. Names, mostly. Or why I walked into a room… That sort of thing. Is that what you mean by changes?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are exactly the sorts of things I'm asking about. The knee pain and some memory difficulties. How long have you been noticing the knee pain, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees… probably a couple of years now? It comes and goes. Worse when it’s cold, or if I’ve been standing for a long time. I just thought it was… wear and tear. I haven’t really done anything about it. Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And the memory issues… have those been getting progressively worse, or do they come and go as well?
PATIENT: Progressively… That’s a good question. I think… they've been a little worse lately, yes. Not dramatically, but… more frequent, maybe. It’s frustrating, mostly. Especially when I’m trying to be helpful with the tickets and remembering seat numbers. I don’t want to mess things up for people.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increasing frequency of memory lapses, and knee pain for about two years. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Not really. I get tired easily, but I’m 69, Doctor. That's just… life, isn’t it? No dizziness, no headaches… nothing major. Oh! Sometimes my hands feel a little numb, but it doesn’t last long.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional numbness in the hands. Can you describe the numbness a little more?
PATIENT: Um… it's not constant, like I said. It’s more like… a tingling, really. In my fingers. And it comes and goes, usually when I’m… well, holding things for a while. Like ticket stubs, or a clipboard. It’s not painful, just… annoying. Doesn’t happen all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any past medical history that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical… Nothing major, Doctor. I had the flu a few times, naturally. And I broke my wrist when I was a boy, playing… something. I don't even remember what. Nothing serious. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses… I just try to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical history, no surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just a little tea sometimes, for a sore throat. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: No medications. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. No bee stings, no food allergies… nothing. I think I’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one, Doctor. My parents are… gone, a long time ago. I don’t really know much about their health, to be honest. They weren’t big on talking about that sort of thing. I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in years. I don’t know anything about her health either. So… not much help, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited family history available. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Well, I’m divorced. Been divorced for… a long time. I mostly keep to myself these days. I live alone, in a small apartment. I don’t really have any hobbies, to speak of. Just… work, mostly. And watching TV. It’s not a very exciting life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, on a special occasion. But that’s it. Not a drinker, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of things. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and memory. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work, you know. People are expecting me.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won’t take long at all. First, let's take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Good. And can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can squeeze. It’s a bit weak, perhaps. Getting old, you know.
DOCTOR: A little weaker than average, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Finally, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Let me think… It’s… August… the 2nd? Yes, August the 2nd. 2025, right?
DOCTOR: Correct. And can you recall three items I’m going to tell you?
PATIENT: Okay. Tell me the items. I hope I can remember them… It’s getting harder these days, you know.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, and penny. Try to remember those, and I’ll ask you in a few minutes.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Got it. Apple, table, penny. I think I’ve got it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Can you recall the three items I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Three items… Oh dear. Let me see… Apple… yes, apple, I remember that. And… something with a… a flat top… a table! Yes, a table. But the third one… It’s on the tip of my tongue… It was small and… metal? No… I can’t quite… I’m sorry, Doctor. I’ve forgotten.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krahn. It's not uncommon. Now, based on the exam and your history, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, you report some memory difficulties, and your grip strength is a bit weaker than average. Your neurological exam is otherwise intact. Based on this, I suspect we are dealing with age-related changes, but the memory issues warrant further investigation. I recommend a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level to rule out any underlying deficiencies. I’d also like to recommend a basic cognitive assessment to get a more detailed picture of your memory and thinking skills. Finally, I’d like to discuss lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a healthy diet, to help manage your blood pressure and overall health. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. I was hoping to avoid this. But… if you think it’s necessary. I just don’t want to be a bother. And I’m not sure I have the energy for a lot of exercise. Lifestyle modifications… That sounds complicated. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my work, I suppose. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. We can take things slowly. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless. The cognitive assessment is a simple questionnaire, and we can schedule it at your convenience. As for lifestyle modifications, we can start with small changes, like taking a short walk each day or adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet. The goal is to improve your overall health and well-being, not to overhaul your life. I’m going to refer you to the lab for the blood tests and schedule you an appointment with a cognitive specialist. I’ll also provide you with a handout on healthy lifestyle choices. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And will this cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Krahn. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. I’ll have the lab send them directly to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. As for the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me see what options we have. Fortunately, there is a program in the city that offers discounted lab tests for uninsured individuals. I’ll fill out a form for you to apply. As for the cognitive specialist, I will call around to see if they offer a sliding scale fee or pro bono services. I will do my best to find affordable options. Here is the referral to the lab, and I'm including information on the assistance program. I'll also contact you next week with updates on the specialist. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, dizziness, or weakness, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… please let me know when you have the results. I appreciate your help. I really do. I should get going. People are expecting me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. You take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We'll be in touch soon. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. .
