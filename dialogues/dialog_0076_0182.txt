DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Orwin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Orwin. Werner Orwin. Look, I haven't got all day, you know. Just need this signed off so I can get this… thing… done with.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have places to be. But I do need to understand what “this thing” is for. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… a face lift. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about, but my daughter insisted. Says I look “tired”. Tired! I’ve lived a full life, what do you expect? But she's paying for it, so… here I am. Just want to know what you need from me to make it happen.
DOCTOR: A facelift, right. And your daughter is… concerned. Alright. Well, we need to make sure you're healthy enough for elective surgery. Have you had any… serious medical issues recently?
PATIENT: Serious? Goodness. Let me think. I had a bit of a cough last winter, but that cleared up. And my knee acts up sometimes, old war wound from… well, never you mind. Nothing a bit of liniment hasn't fixed. I’m a sturdy Norwegian, you know. We don’t get seriously ill.
DOCTOR: A cough… and a knee. Alright. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, are you trying to be difficult? I told you, just the cough and the knee. I’m eighty-one years old, not a porcelain doll. I've lived a good, hard life. You want a list of every ache and pain? It'll take all day. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: The chart does show some previous visits for hypertension… and elevated cholesterol. Were you aware of those?
PATIENT: Hypertension? Cholesterol? Now there's something. My regular doctor, old man Henderson, he never said a word about any of that. Probably just trying to get more money out of me with fancy tests. Honestly, I wouldn't trust those doctors these days. They just make things up. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It could be. Uncontrolled hypertension and high cholesterol increase the risk during surgery. When was the last time you had those checked?
PATIENT: Checked? Oh, goodness. Years, I suppose. Probably when Henderson retired. Which… must have been… five, maybe six years ago? I haven't been feeling unwell, so I haven't bothered. Look, is this going to stop me from getting this done? Because I'm not driving all the way into the city again for nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Mr. Orwin. We’d need some updated bloodwork, at the very least. And an EKG to assess your heart. I’m not comfortable proceeding with elective surgery without that information. It’s a matter of safety.
PATIENT: Safety? Honestly, the things they make you do these days. Look, I've survived worse than a little face lift. I was a terrazzo worker, you know? Dust, fumes, heavy lifting… Now that was dangerous. I don't need a fancy test to tell me if I'm healthy enough. But fine. Fine! What do I have to do? Where do I get this “bloodwork” and this… ECG thing? And how long will it take? I’ve got things to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: There’s a lab just down the street – the address is on that form. And the EKG… we can do that right here, after I finish with a quick examination. But I’m warning you, it’s going to take a while. And I may need a cardiology consult, depending on the results. It's not my preferred process, but I'm attempting to get it done quickly for you. Is that acceptable?
