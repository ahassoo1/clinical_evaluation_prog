DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have several patients waiting, so if you could be concise, that would be greatly appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. Concise, you say? Yes, I can try. It is… the words. They do not come so easily anymore. I… struggle to find them. It is most frustrating, honestly. I hope it is not… too bothersome to explain.
DOCTOR: “Words not coming easily…” I see. And how long has this… difficulty been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… how long? That is… a difficult question. It feels like… some time now. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It is not sudden, you understand. It has been… a slow fading. Like a… a light dimming. I am… not very good with time, I apologize. It is… difficult to recall specifics.
DOCTOR: A slow fading… right. And has this… “fading” impacted any specific activities?
PATIENT: Specific activities… yes. Talking to my… friends, mostly. It is… embarrassing, to pause and search for the correct… phrasing. I used to be quite the conversationalist, you see. And… reading, also. Sometimes I must reread a paragraph several times to understand it. It… lessens the enjoyment, greatly. It is… a worry, you understand. I do not wish to… lose myself, so to speak.
DOCTOR: “Difficulty with conversation and reading… impacting enjoyment.” Are there any other cognitive difficulties you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Cognitive… difficulties? Hmm. That is… a big word. Let me think… I do… sometimes misplace things. Not important things, usually. My keys, perhaps. Or… where I put the remote. And… I struggle with names now. Remembering them. It is… very unsettling. I apologize if this is… disorganized. My thoughts are not… as clear as they once were.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Yes. Well, my… wife, she passed away five years ago. It was… a long illness. Heart trouble, I believe. And… I had my appendix removed when I was… a young man. Beyond that… I do not believe so. I am generally quite… healthy, for my age. I try to eat well and… get some exercise, when I can. Though lately… even that has been… difficult. I apologize, Doctor. Is this… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think carefully. No, I do not believe so. I have never… reacted badly to any medication. My wife… she was allergic to penicillin, I recall. But I… have no allergies of my own. At least, not that I am aware of. I apologize if this is… a slow process. It is… frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any… regular medications. Just… a vitamin D supplement, during the winter months. My doctor… suggested it. For the… bones, you see. Beyond that… nothing. I prefer to… avoid them, if possible. My wife… she was always taking pills. It… was not pleasant. I apologize. Is this… helpful? I hope I am not… wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, Mr. Gyamfi. Just a basic neurological assessment to start. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. I can follow your finger. Please… do not rush. I may be… a little slow, but I will do my best. There… is that all? I hope I am… not causing too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger… good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm. The year… yes. Let me think carefully. Is it… 2024? No… wait. I believe… it is 2025. Yes. August 2nd, is it not? It is… difficult to keep track, sometimes. I apologize. My mind… feels a little foggy today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to repeat these three words after me: apple, table, pencil. And try to remember them, we’ll test you on them later. Apple. Table. Pencil.
PATIENT: Apple. Table. Pencil. Apple… Table… Pencil. I have… written them down, just to be safe. I hope that is… permissible? My memory is… not what it once was. Is this… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gyamfi, that’s quite alright. Now, can you tell me your date of birth?
PATIENT: Hmm. My date of birth… that is… a difficult question. Let me think very carefully. It was… March 12th. Yes, March 12th. The year… 1948. I believe so. It has been… many years ago. Is that… correct? My mind is… a little clouded today, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Correct. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. First, who is the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Hmm… the President… that is… a difficult question. I follow the news… occasionally. But… the names… they all blur together. Is it… Mr. Biden? Yes, I believe it is Mr. Biden. Is that… correct? It is… very unsettling, to forget such things. My apologies, Doctor. My mind is… not as sharp as it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Gyamfi, based on this brief assessment, and given your report of slowly progressive difficulty with words, memory, and cognition, I am concerned about potential cognitive impairment. However, these symptoms can have many causes. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And, I'm going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a neurologist? Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it is… necessary, I am happy to cooperate. I want to… understand what is happening. I do not wish to… lose myself, as I said. It is… a little frightening, honestly. But… if it helps, I am willing to do whatever is… required. Is this… a long process? My apologies. I am… a little anxious.
DOCTOR: It's a standard procedure, Mr. Gyamfi. The blood work will help us rule out deficiencies or other medical causes. The neurologist will conduct a more detailed cognitive assessment. I'll have the receptionist schedule those appointments for you as you leave. In the meantime, I recommend having a family member or friend accompany you to those appointments, just in case. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very sensible. A family member… yes, I can ask my… friend, Mrs. Schmidt. She is… very kind. She can… accompany me. Thank you for… taking the time, Doctor. I appreciate it greatly. Is there… anything else I need to do? Or… any questions you have for me? My apologies if I am… being bothersome.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gyamfi, that will be all. The receptionist will provide you with the necessary paperwork for the blood work and neurologist referral. Just try to rest and not dwell on it too much until we have the results. I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your time. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Very much. I will… try to rest. And I will… ask Mrs. Schmidt. Goodbye. .
