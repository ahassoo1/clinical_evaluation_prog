DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Kur. It's… well, it's my memory. It's been getting worse, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me. Little things, mostly, but they’re adding up.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. “Memory problems.” Okay. And how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe six months? It felt gradual at first, like just being a bit more forgetful than usual. But the last couple of months… it’s definitely been more noticeable. I keep repeating myself to people, or forgetting what I was even talking about mid-sentence. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing, yes. It can be unsettling. So, six months. And are these memory issues affecting your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, a little. Work is okay, I can usually manage, but I’ve had a couple of close calls with appointments. I almost missed a continuing education class last week because I completely forgot to put it in my calendar. And… I’ve been leaving things around the house, you know? Keys, my phone… stuff like that. Nothing major, but it's… frustrating. And it’s worrying my sister. She’s the one who really pushed me to come see you.
DOCTOR: Your sister is wise to encourage you to seek medical attention. Alright. So, you're experiencing both prospective memory issues – forgetting future events – and some trouble with recall. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know. And I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that’s about it. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. No high blood pressure, no diabetes… I go for regular check-ups with my family doctor. He always says I’m in good shape. He’s probably wondering why I’m even here. I don't even know if this is something a doctor can help with.
DOCTOR: "Pretty healthy." That's good to know, but even healthy people can experience cognitive changes. And yes, there are things we can investigate. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced memory problems or been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a tough one. My grandma, on my mother's side… she did get pretty confused towards the end of her life. My mom always said it was “old age,” but I guess… looking back, it could have been more than that? She definitely had trouble remembering things, and she got really agitated sometimes. My dad’s side… I don't really know. He wasn't around much, and I never really talked to his family about health stuff. So, maybe? I honestly don't know. It's not something we ever discussed.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's helpful, or at least provides a starting point. Now, let's talk about your current medications and any allergies you have. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And… I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but only when I really need it. No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty careful about what I put in my body. Honestly, I try to stay as natural as possible. I even make my own cleaning products. It’s a bit of a hobby, I guess.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, before we proceed, can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Okay… well, I wake up around 6:30, usually. I have a quick breakfast – oatmeal, or yogurt, something like that. Then I get ready for work. I’m a dentist, so I'm at the office by 8:00. I see patients all day – fillings, cleanings, root canals, you know. It keeps me busy. I usually have lunch with the office staff. Then I finish up around 5:00. I drive home, make dinner… usually something healthy. Then I watch a little TV, read a book, and go to bed around 10:00. Weekends are pretty similar, except I try to get outside more – hiking, gardening, stuff like that. It's a pretty routine life, I guess. Not very exciting.
DOCTOR: Routine, but consistent. Alright. Now, let's do a brief cognitive assessment. It will just be a few simple questions and tasks to get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. It’s nothing to worry about, just a standard procedure. We'll start with your short-term recall. I’m going to say three unrelated words, and I want you to repeat them back to me immediately. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. That sounds fine. Three words, right? Ready when you are. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: Apple… Table… Penny. Please repeat those back to me.
PATIENT: Um… Apple… Table… and… oh, darn. What was the third one? I know I heard it… it's on the tip of my tongue… Penny? No… that doesn’t sound right.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Heidenthal. It's perfectly normal to have a little trouble. Just try to recall the third word if you can. If not, that’s alright too. We can move on. But let’s give it a moment.
PATIENT: No… I'm so sorry. It’s just… gone. I know I heard it, but I can’t… it’s frustrating. I feel like my brain is just… blank. It was a simple word, right? It's just… really embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. This is simply a baseline assessment. Now, let's move on to a slightly different task. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your current date and location. Do you know today's date?
PATIENT: Oh… um… today is… August… the second? Yes, August second. And the year is… 2025, right? I think so. I usually keep track of dates pretty well. I have a calendar in the kitchen, but… sometimes I get a little mixed up.
DOCTOR: And where are we right now, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: We're… in your office? Yes, Dr. Kur’s office. I remember driving here… it took about 40 minutes. It's in… the city, isn't it? Near the hospital? I feel like I'm stumbling over my words.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your vital signs and do a neurological assessment. It will just involve some simple tests to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope you find something. Or… don't find something, I guess? I don’t know. I’m just… worried. Is it something serious, Dr. Kur?
DOCTOR: Let's proceed with the examination, Ms. Heidenthal. We will gather the necessary information and discuss your concerns afterwards. Please have a seat. Heart sounds are normal and lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please place your arms loosely at your sides and keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay… relaxed arms, relaxed legs… Is that okay? I feel a little awkward, to be honest. I'm not used to being… examined.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough for the basic examination. Please sit up slowly. We’ll discuss the findings and next steps.
PATIENT: Okay… So…? What did you find? Is it bad? I feel like I’m messing everything up. Even just following your finger was hard. I don't understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, the examination revealed some mild deficits in coordination and reflexes. Your short-term recall appears slightly impaired, as evidenced by your difficulty recalling the three words and the hesitation during the finger-to-nose test. However, your eye movements were normal, and there was no indication of any major neurological issues. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. These findings could be due to a variety of factors, including stress, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment, or other underlying medical conditions. To further investigate, I recommend we order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. We should also consider a brain MRI to get a more detailed look at your brain structure and rule out any abnormalities. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI?… That sounds… scary. And a neurologist? Is it that serious? I mean, I just thought it might be stress. My sister keeps telling me I need to slow down, but… Blood work, okay, I can do blood work. But… the MRI… and seeing a neurologist… are you saying you think it might be something really bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, I understand your concerns. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging procedure that provides valuable information about the brain. It does not involve any radiation and is generally considered safe. However, I recognize that it can be anxiety-provoking for some individuals. The referral to a neurologist is simply a precautionary measure. A neurologist is a specialist in brain health and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. It does not necessarily mean there is something seriously wrong. It's important to rule out any potential underlying medical conditions, and the MRI and neurological evaluation will help us do that. We need to gather all the necessary information before we can make a definitive diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the MRI or the neurological evaluation?
PATIENT: Um… what are we looking for, exactly? With the MRI? Like, what would it show if… if something was wrong? And… what if it is something bad? I just… I don’t want to think about it. But I also don’t want to ignore it. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, with the MRI, we are looking for any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, strokes, or signs of atrophy—which is a decrease in brain volume. We also look for any areas of inflammation or damage that could be contributing to your symptoms. If there were something concerning on the MRI, it would not necessarily mean a definitive diagnosis. It would simply provide us with more information to guide further investigation and treatment. The neurologist will review the MRI results with you in detail and discuss all possible options. I understand that this is a lot to process, and it’s completely natural to feel anxious and overwhelmed. We will take things one step at a time. First, we will order the blood work and schedule the MRI. Then, we will refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. We will support you throughout this process and answer any questions you may have. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Um… no. I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… scheduling the tests. And… trying not to panic. Thank you, Dr. Kur. For… explaining everything.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. My nurse will assist you with scheduling the blood work and MRI. She will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I will be in touch with you once the results are available. In the meantime, please try to stay calm and focus on taking care of yourself. Have a good day, Ms. Heidenthal.
