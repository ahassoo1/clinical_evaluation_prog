DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s about a surgery… a cosmetic one. I believe I’m here for a check-up before that happens? My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I’m afraid I don’t recall all the specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Many patients find it helpful to have a pre-operative assessment. Cosmetic surgery, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… it’s something I’ve been considering for a while now. It feels quite important, although… why exactly is a bit hazy, if I'm honest. My husband… he would have wanted me to be happy. Is it alright if I speak a bit slowly? I just want to make sure I explain things as best I can.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. Take all the time you need. There’s no rush at all. And it's completely understandable that details are a bit unclear; we'll piece things together. Your husband wanting you to be happy is a lovely reason. Now, do you recall what type of surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I… I think it has something to do with my face? Perhaps my nose… or cheeks? It wasn’t a major thing, I don't believe. More of a… refinement, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, the details are incredibly blurry. I mostly remember discussions with the surgeon, and the feeling that it would help me feel more like… myself. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mackenzi. It's very common to focus on the emotional aspects rather than the technical details when it comes to elective procedures. Let me check your records here… Ah, yes. It appears you’re scheduled for a rhinoplasty and a limited buccal fat pad removal. Is that ringing any bells?
PATIENT: Rhinoplasty… and… buccal fat pad removal? Yes… yes, those names do sound familiar, now that you mention them. The nose… and the cheeks, to make them look a bit less… full. That’s right. It was Dr. Alvarez who explained everything. I… I remember him being very kind. So, this check-up is to make sure I’m healthy enough for it?
DOCTOR: Precisely. It's standard procedure before any surgery, even elective ones. We want to ensure you’re in the best possible condition for a smooth recovery. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… yes. Well, I’ve always been generally healthy, I think. I don’t recall any major illnesses or surgeries aside from a tonsillectomy when I was a child. Oh, and I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but nothing serious. I do have a bit of… well, anxiety. It flares up sometimes, mostly since… since my husband passed away. I haven’t been on any medication for it, though. Just try to manage with… breathing exercises. Is that helpful information?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you, Mackenzi. Knowing about the anxiety is particularly important. And it's good to hear you’ve been managing it without medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I used to get itchy skin sometimes when I was a child, but my mother said it was just from certain plants. No food allergies, and I haven’t had any issues with medications either. But… It’s possible I’m forgetting something. I really wish my memory was better. Is it alright if we double-check my records to be sure?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. That's what we’re here for. Let me take a look… Ah, yes. It states here you had a mild reaction to penicillin as a child – a rash, but nothing life-threatening. Is that consistent with what you recall?
PATIENT: Yes! That's right! Penicillin… a rash. I completely forgot about that. It was a long time ago, and it wasn’t very serious. Thank you for reminding me, Doctor. It’s good to have that documented, just in case. I really appreciate you being so patient with me. My husband always said I was terrible at remembering things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright. We want to be thorough. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Not currently. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible – things like chamomile tea for sleep, or ginger for an upset stomach. Nothing regular, though. Just… occasional things. I've been avoiding much of anything, to be honest. I like to keep things simple. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mackenzi. Keeping things simple is a good approach. Now, to get a fuller picture of your health, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… Well, I spend most of my time outdoors. I work in landscaping and groundskeeping, so I’m quite active during the day. Lots of walking, bending, lifting… it keeps me busy, that’s for sure. I try to eat healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables – but I’m not always the best at it. And… I don’t really socialize much anymore. It’s hard, since… well, you know. I mostly keep to myself. Is that… is that enough information?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mackenzi. It gives me a good sense of your daily routine. And it’s perfectly alright to take things at your own pace. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And she also had arthritis, quite badly towards the end. My father… he was generally healthy, as far as I remember. He didn't really talk much about his health. And… I had an aunt who had breast cancer, many years ago. But that’s all I can really recall, I’m afraid. My family wasn’t very open about medical things. It’s a bit hazy, honestly. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is there a way to check records for family history, perhaps?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. And yes, sometimes we can find some information in the system if family members have also been patients here. Let me check… Ah, yes. It does state here your mother had hypertension and osteoarthritis. And your aunt, on your mother’s side, was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 62. It doesn’t list anything further. So, that confirms what you recalled. Now, before we move on, is there anything specific you're worried about, health-wise?
PATIENT: Worried about… hmm. Well, not really about my physical health, no. I've always been strong, thankfully. But… I worry about the recovery. I live alone, you see. And… since my husband passed away, I haven’t really had anyone to help me if something goes wrong. I just… I want to make sure everything goes smoothly. And that I can manage on my own afterwards. That’s my biggest worry, I think. That I won’t be able to cope. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: That is not silly at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned about recovery, especially living alone. It's very thoughtful of you to consider that. We can definitely discuss a post-operative plan to ensure you have the support you need. We can explore options like having a visiting nurse check in on you, or arranging for a friend or neighbor to help with meals and errands. Would you like to discuss that further?
PATIENT: Oh… that would be wonderful, Doctor. Truly wonderful. A visiting nurse… or someone to just check in on me… that would put my mind at ease tremendously. I didn’t even know that was an option. Yes, please. Let's discuss that further. I… I really appreciate you listening to my concerns. It’s been a long time since someone has taken the time to really understand what I’m feeling.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. That’s what I’m here for. Let's talk about a post-operative care plan. Before we do that, let me just do a quick physical exam to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I just… want to make sure everything is alright. And that I’m prepared for what’s ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Good. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. And finally, let's take a look at your nose and cheeks. Skin is healthy, no obvious signs of infection. Nose is symmetrical. Overall, you appear to be in good physical condition for surgery. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. No pain or discomfort. Just… a little anxious, perhaps. But that’s nothing physical. Everything feels alright, as far as I can tell. I’m glad to hear I seem to be in good condition. It’s a relief, honestly. It’s just… the thought of going through with it… it’s a bit overwhelming. But I’m trying to stay positive.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious before a surgery, and it sounds like you’re managing it well. Now, based on my assessment and the information you’ve provided, I believe you are a good candidate for the rhinoplasty and limited buccal fat pad removal. However, before we proceed, I want to discuss a post-operative plan in detail to ensure a smooth recovery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds wonderful. Please, let's discuss the plan. The more prepared I am, the better I’ll feel. Anything you can tell me about what to expect, and how to manage things afterwards, would be greatly appreciated. I'm ready to listen. Perhaps a list of things I should have on hand, or people I should contact… anything at all. Thank you so much for taking the time to address my concerns. It truly means a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. Let’s go through this step-by-step. First, regarding post-operative pain management… We'll prescribe you a mild pain reliever, but we encourage you to manage with over-the-counter options as much as possible. You'll need to keep the incision sites clean and dry, and avoid strenuous activity for at least two weeks. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment one week and one month post-surgery to monitor your progress. Now, regarding the support network… Do you have a friend or family member who could check in on you for the first few days?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question, Doctor. I don't have much family nearby. My husband… he always took care of everything. And my friends… well, we’ve drifted apart since he passed away. I live alone, as I mentioned. I haven’t really spoken to anyone regularly in quite some time. I was hoping the visiting nurse would be enough, if that’s possible. Is that… feasible? I’m not trying to be difficult, I promise. It’s just… I don’t want to burden anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. You’re not a burden at all. And yes, the visiting nurse is certainly feasible. We can arrange for a nurse to visit you twice a day for the first three days post-surgery, and once a day for the following week. They can monitor your vital signs, assess your wound healing, and ensure you’re taking your medication correctly. They can also provide emotional support and answer any questions you may have. We also have a list of local support groups for individuals who have experienced loss. Would you be interested in receiving that information?
PATIENT: A visiting nurse twice a day… that would be… incredibly helpful, Doctor. Truly. It would put my mind at ease immensely. And yes, please, information about the support groups would be wonderful. I haven't really considered that before, but… it might be nice to connect with others who understand. You’ve been so kind and understanding, Doctor. I feel so much better prepared now. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to know, or any further steps I need to take before the surgery?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I could help. Before the surgery, you’ll need to complete a pre-operative questionnaire and obtain any necessary medical clearances from your primary care physician. The surgical center will contact you to schedule those appointments. You'll also need to arrange transportation to and from the surgical center on the day of the surgery. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me or my office if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything so thoroughly. I feel very reassured and prepared. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I truly appreciate it. I think… I think I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mackenzi. I’m glad to hear that. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best with your surgery and recovery. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all.
