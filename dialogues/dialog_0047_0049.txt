DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Press. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Hmm... what does bring me in? Now, that’s a good question. Seems like folks just ain’t as clear as they used to be when they talk. My ears, I reckon. Everything’s a bit muffled, like talkin’ underwater, ya know? Not terrible, but… harder. I just figured I should get it checked, before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Right. So, difficulty hearing – a progressive muffled sound. And you're noticing this now?
PATIENT: Progressive… is that a fancy way of sayin’ it’s gettin’ worse? Yes, that’s it. It’s been creepin’ up on me, I suppose. Hard to say when exactly it started. Maybe a few months ago? Or was it last winter? Time just… slips away, ya know? I don't rightly recall.
DOCTOR: Yes, time does have a way of doing that. A few months… alright. And is it in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm… both, I think. Yes, both ears. It’s not like one’s completely gone, mind ya. Just… quieter. And sometimes, like when there's a lot of noise – like the television, or folks talkin’ all at once – it gets real hard to make out what anyone’s sayin’. It's mostly high-pitched sounds, I think, that I miss.
DOCTOR: Primarily high-pitched sounds, difficulty in both ears, worse with background noise… Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or clicking sounds in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that’s a thought. Sometimes, yes. Very faint, though. Like a little cricket chirpin’ way off in the distance. Not all the time, thankfully. Mostly when things are… quiet. It doesn't bother me too much, really. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, tinnitus – intermittent, faint ringing. Now, have you been exposed to any loud noises regularly?
PATIENT: Loud noises… hmm. Well, I used to work in a shoe factory, ya know? Operated the machines. They weren't quiet, that’s for sure. Big clatter and hummin’ all day long. That was… oh, goodness, a long time ago now. Fifty years, maybe more. But I reckon that couldn't be it, could it? It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: It could be, Mr. Schneer. Noise exposure can certainly contribute to hearing loss, even decades later. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a big question. Let me think… I had a bit of a bad knee a few years back, needed a little surgery, but that’s all fixed now. And my doctor keeps tellin’ me my blood pressure's a little high, but I take a pill for that, so it’s under control, I think. Other than that… not much. I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. I don't remember much else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're askin' me things I just don’t remember! Let me see… I get somethin' for my arthritis in my hands sometimes, when they’re achin', but I don't take it every day. A little white pill, I think. But honestly, Doctor, I get so many pills these days, it's hard to keep track. My daughter usually sorts them out for me.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll try to get a complete list from your pharmacy. Now, let’s do a quick examination of your ears. It won’t take long. If you could just sit here for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable, ya hear? Old bones ain’t as flexible as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Just going to take a quick look inside your ears now. This might be a little cool. … Hmm. There’s some cerumen – wax – in both ears. Nothing alarming, but it could be contributing to the muffled sound. And yes, the same on this side. The tympanic membranes – your eardrums – look intact, but a little dull. Alright. I'm going to perform a quick hearing test now. It involves wearing headphones and indicating when you hear tones. It's painless, I assure you.
PATIENT: Tones, eh? Sounds alright to me. I used to have pretty good ears, ya know. Could hear a pin drop. Though, that was a long time ago. Alright, headphones sound good. Just tell me what I need to do. I’m a bit hard of hearin', so maybe speak up a little?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’m going to play a series of tones in each ear, at different frequencies. When you hear a tone, please raise your hand. It doesn’t matter if it’s faint – just let me know when you hear something. We’ll start with your right ear.
PATIENT: There! I think I heard somethin’… very faint, like a little beep. Is that right? It’s hard to say. Everything sounds a bit… muffled.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And now… Okay… and now the left ear. Right. The results indicate mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, predominantly at the higher frequencies. This is consistent with your symptoms and likely due to age-related hearing loss, possibly exacerbated by previous noise exposure. It’s not a sudden loss, thankfully, but it is progressing.
PATIENT: Progressin’, you say? Well, that don’t sound good. What does that mean, exactly? Is there somethin’ you can do about it? I don't want to go completely deaf, ya know? It’d be awful lonely.
DOCTOR: It means the hearing loss is likely to continue to worsen over time, though the rate of progression varies. Thankfully, there are things we can do. The most common option is hearing aids. They amplify sounds, making them easier to hear. We can get a proper fitting and see if they improve your quality of life. Alternatively, we can manage expectations and communication strategies. I'm going to refer you to an audiologist for a full evaluation and to discuss hearing aid options if you're interested. They are the experts in this area. I'll also write you a prescription for cerumen removal to see if that improves things in the short term. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… I’ve heard about them. Folks complain they don't sound natural. And they’re expensive, aren’t they? I suppose I’m not against tryin’ somethin’, if it’ll help. But I don’t want any fancy gadgets, ya hear? Just somethin’ simple. And… what about this cerumen removal? Is that painful?
DOCTOR: The technology in hearing aids has improved significantly. Modern aids are very discreet and can be programmed to suit your individual hearing loss and preferences. They don't sound like the old ones. And yes, they can be expensive, but Medicare may cover a portion of the cost. The audiologist can assist with that. As for the cerumen removal, it’s generally painless. We use ear drops to soften the wax, and then gently irrigate the ear with warm water. It's a relatively quick and simple procedure. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly reputable audiologist in the area. Here’s the prescription for the ear drops. Start those drops as directed for a week, then schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dr. Reed, eh? And ear drops… Alright, I think so. You’re talkin’ pretty fast, Doctor. It's hard to keep track of everything. So, ear drops for a week, then see Dr. Reed about… what did you call 'em? Hearin’ aids? Alright. I'll try to remember. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, ear drops for a week, then schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed to discuss hearing aids. I’ll also send the results of your hearing test to her office. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s all for now. Just… try to remember the names, ya know? Thank you for yer time, Doctor. I appreciate ya listenin’ to an old man ramble.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Schneer. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Here's a printout of today's visit summary. Have a good day. .
