DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my legs, really. They just…gave out. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Felt like jelly, honestly. It’s quite inconvenient, you know? I give tours, and you can't exactly tour when you can barely stand.
DOCTOR: Right, tours. And this weakness... it just came on suddenly, after the cold?
PATIENT: Yes, quite suddenly. One minute I was fine, packing for a trip to Copán, the next…wobbly. Not a gradual thing at all. It’s just…odd. I haven’t fallen, thankfully, but I’ve had to sit down a lot more than usual. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. People expect a tour guide to be…sturdy.
DOCTOR: Hm. And is it both legs equally, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: Both, actually. Pretty much the same. Not one being significantly weaker than the other, no. It's... disconcerting. Like they just forgot how to hold me up. It feels…equal, if that makes sense. Not like a pulled muscle or anything specific, just…gone. Honestly, I've never experienced anything like it. And I've had colds before, plenty of them.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it…a little tingling. Not constant, but it comes and goes in my feet, like pins and needles. It's not painful, just…unpleasant. And I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? It's hard to say if that's related or just…life. I suppose. But the tingling is new, I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any fever, headaches, or any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. No headaches either. And…no, everything’s been normal in that department. Honestly, if it wasn’t for this ridiculous weakness, I’d hardly even bother coming in. It's just…so unlike me. I'm usually very active. I hike, I walk miles with tour groups…this is slowing me down considerably. And I hate being slowed down. Frankly, I find it unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s take a look at you then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. The sooner I figure this out, the better. I have a group scheduled for Tikal in two weeks, and I simply can't cancel. It’s rather important, you see. And frankly, I’d rather not spend another day feeling like a…a fragile vase. So, yes, let’s get to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat there, and we’ll start with a basic neurological exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Just relax and let me know if anything feels painful. I’ll need you to follow my instructions as best you can.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose that’s reasonable. Though I must say, I’m usually the one giving instructions, not the other way around. Still, I’ll cooperate. Just be gentle, if you would. I have a rather important reputation to uphold, and I’d rather not risk anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your legs completely… good. Now, I’m going to tap just below your kneecap. Tell me if that feels particularly uncomfortable. Hmm. Reflexes are…present, but a little diminished. Now, let's check your strength. Can you push your feet against my hands like you're pressing the gas pedal in a car?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. It feels rather…weak, honestly. It takes considerably more effort than it should. And it’s not like I haven’t been using my legs. I hike for hours! This is…concerning. You see? I told you it was weak. It’s not my imagination. It's just…not right. Are you sure your equipment is working properly?
DOCTOR: Yes, my equipment is working perfectly fine, Sharifa. And I appreciate your…enthusiasm, but it doesn't help me assess the situation accurately. Now, can you try pushing against my hands again, just a little harder, but only if it’s comfortable. We need to get an accurate reading. I’m also going to check your sensation. I’ll lightly touch different parts of your feet and legs with this, and you tell me when you feel it. Sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. But do be careful. And frankly, I expect a proper explanation for all of this. “Sensation,” you say? As if I don’t know how my own body works. Still, if it will speed things along…yes, go ahead. But be gentle, and don't waste my time. I have a trip to plan, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. Though it’s…a little muted, honestly. Not as sharp as it should be, perhaps. It’s a subtle difference, but I notice these things. I pay attention to details, you see. It's part of my profession. A good tour guide needs to be observant. Is this going to take much longer? My time is rather valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on this initial exam, your reflexes are diminished, and there’s some decreased sensation in your feet and legs. Strength is also slightly reduced. This is concerning. Now, I'm going to order some bloodwork to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. And I think it would also be wise to get an MRI of your spine to check for any nerve compression. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? Frankly, that sounds…excessive. But…if it’s absolutely necessary. Deficiencies, I suppose, are plausible. I do try to maintain a healthy diet, but traveling makes it difficult. Very well, order your tests. But I expect a swift turnaround. And I would appreciate a clear explanation of the results, not just medical jargon. I'm a practical woman, Doctor. I need answers, and I need them quickly. And frankly, if these tests don’t reveal anything, I’m not spending another minute on this. I have a tour to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a vitamin B12 level, and an MRI of your spine. The MRI will take a few days to schedule, and the bloodwork results should be back within a week. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. Now, I'm also going to ask you a few questions about your medical history... Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any other chronic condition?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not. I maintain a perfectly reasonable weight. And frankly, the idea is…insulting. Chronic conditions? No. I’ve had the occasional cold, as I’ve mentioned, but nothing serious. A touch of arthritis in my knees now and then, but that’s to be expected at my age. Nothing that would explain this. And frankly, I’m a very healthy woman. I assure you. Are you quite finished with your interrogation, Doctor? Because I have rather a lot to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any injuries to your back or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, a minor sprain in my ankle a few years ago, hiking in the rainforest. Nothing serious, though. I rested it for a few days and was fine. And…I slipped on some ice in Copán last winter and bruised my tailbone, but that was hardly an injury. I was back on my feet within a week. Nothing that would cause this…this ridiculous weakness. Honestly, it’s quite baffling. It's as if my legs have simply…forgotten how to function.
DOCTOR: And do you take any medications, regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I prefer to maintain my health naturally, if possible. A little turmeric in my tea, perhaps, but nothing pharmaceutical. I don’t believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. Frankly, I find the idea…unsettling. A good night’s sleep and a healthy diet are all one needs, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, it’s…complicated. My mother had some arthritis, as I mentioned, but nothing significant. My father…he had a weak heart, I believe. But that was decades ago, and frankly, I don’t see the relevance. We’re not talking about heart problems here, Doctor. We’re talking about legs that have suddenly decided to betray me. Honestly, I find all these questions…rather pointless. Are we nearly finished? Because I have a feeling my time is being wasted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly, it depends. If I’m touring, it’s…vigorous. Up early, packing, meeting the group, hours of walking, explaining the history, ensuring everyone is safe and comfortable. A great deal of standing, walking, and talking. If I’m not touring, it's planning the next trip, researching new sites, arranging accommodations, booking flights. A great deal of sitting, reading, and making phone calls. Either way, it’s…active. Or was active, before this…this unfortunate predicament. Honestly, it’s quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa. I've got a reasonable picture now. I've ordered the tests as we discussed. I want you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. If the weakness worsens, or you experience any numbness, tingling in your arms, or difficulty with bowel or bladder control, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and give you instructions for the bloodwork. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well…will this affect my trip? Honestly, that’s my primary concern. And frankly, if it doesn’t show anything, I expect a referral to someone who can actually provide a solution. I’m not inclined to waste time on tests that yield no results. Other than that…no. I think you’ve taken enough of my time for the moment. Just get the tests done, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. And please…ensure the nurse is efficient. I have a schedule to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns. We'll get the tests done as quickly as possible, and if they are inconclusive, we can discuss a referral. The nurse will be informed of your concerns and will be as efficient as possible. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the test orders. Please review it carefully. Thank you for your patience, Sharifa. Have a good day. And please, do contact us immediately if anything changes.
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. A summary would be…appreciated. I’ll contact you if necessary. But frankly, I doubt it will come to that.
