DOCTOR: Hi Triana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have a lot of time for this. It's my stomach. Been… well, it's been awful. Just… constantly running to the bathroom. And nothing seems to help. I've tried everything the pharmacy suggested.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Constantly running to the bathroom" – that sounds really unpleasant. And you've tried some over-the-counter things already. Hmmm. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about how it’s been awful?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not one for details, okay? It's… watery. A lot of it. And it's not just once or twice a day. It's… constant. Like, I can barely leave the house. That’s why I'm here, I guess. I don’t need to describe everything to you. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: No, no, that's perfectly enough. You don't need to go into detail if you're not comfortable. "Watery" and “constant,” and keeping you from leaving the house… that definitely sounds disruptive. Has this been a sudden thing, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Sudden. Definitely sudden. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? I was fine, completely normal, then… boom. Just started. It's not like I gradually got worse. I woke up one morning and… this. Honestly, I thought it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, sudden onset… and hasn’t improved. That's helpful. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or stomach cramps alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. And I haven’t thrown up. Cramps, yeah, a little. Not terrible, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, mostly. Nothing that would send me to the emergency room. Honestly, the bathroom trips are the worst part. It’s just… embarrassing, and exhausting. I feel weak all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, some mild cramping, and feeling weak. That makes sense. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do you need to know that? Look, I told you, I’m not one for details. I haven't looked closely, if that's what you're asking. I just… deal with it. It’s unpleasant enough as it is. I haven’t noticed anything obvious, if that helps. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand. You're right, we don't need to dwell on unpleasant details. It's good you haven’t noticed anything obvious. To help me figure out what's going on, could you tell me about anything different you ate or drank in the days before this started?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. I eat the same things pretty much every day. Salmon, rice, some vegetables. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body. I didn’t go to any fancy restaurants or anything. Maybe… I had some berries a few days before? Wild blueberries, picked them myself. But I eat those all the time too. I really don't think that's it. It just came on out of nowhere. I'm starting to get really annoyed. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, pretty consistent diet, wild blueberries a few days before… and no recent changes. Hmm. Do you have any allergies, or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any problems with allergies. And I don’t take any medications. I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself. I really just want to know what's causing this and how to stop it. It’s been a week. A week of this. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications. Alright. I'm going to ask a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No. Not at all. I haven’t left the state in… well, years. I live here. I work here. I don’t go anywhere. Honestly, I think you’re just asking random questions now. Is this some sort of standard procedure to try and make me feel stupid? Because it's working.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I apologize if it feels that way. We're just trying to rule out different possibilities. It’s important to be thorough. Okay. Just one more quick question, then we can move to the exam. Have you been around anyone else who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: No. I keep to myself mostly. My husband… well, he’s gone. So, no. No one. I haven’t been around anyone sick. Look, I really don’t understand what’s taking so long. Is there a test you can do? Can’t you just give me something to stop it? I'm starting to feel really lightheaded. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Feeling lightheaded is concerning. Let's check your blood pressure quickly, then we’ll do a brief exam. I’m also going to order some blood work to get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you tell me about your husband?
