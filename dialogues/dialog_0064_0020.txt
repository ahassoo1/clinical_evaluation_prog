DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… the nurse tell me is for check-up. Remote, she say. I do not feel so bad, but my son, he worry. He say I need to see someone.
DOCTOR: Alright, a check-up, good. And your son is concerned, that's very good of him to encourage you to come in. Sometimes it's helpful to have another set of eyes, even if you're not feeling terribly unwell. “Remote,” you said?
PATIENT: Yes, remote. She say on the… the computer? Not here in the office, is what I think. I am here now, yes, but she say first is on the… the screen. It was… strange. But I did it.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes! The telehealth visit. We've been doing more of those lately. It can feel a little strange, I agree. So, you did that, and now we're doing an in-person part of the check-up. That’s excellent. Just to be clear, and to help me get a good picture of things, let’s start with what's been going on with you recently. Are you having any particular symptoms or concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Hmm… recently? Not much. Maybe… little tired. But I am old, yes? Old people are tired. My hands, they sometimes hurt, but I work with cars all my life. That is normal, I think. Nothing big. Is why I say I do not understand why my son make such a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you're able to pinpoint some potential reasons for those feelings. Fatigue and hand pain are common, and it's smart of you to consider your history. But it's also good that your son is looking out for you. We want to rule out anything else that might be going on. When you say “tired,” is it a general feeling of being run down, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… always. Not so bad I cannot work, but… after work, I just sit. I do not have energy to do much. Before, I like garden, I like walk. Now… not so much. It is just… slow. Everything is slow. And I sleep, but do not feel rested. Is that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant change in your energy levels, and that's worth investigating. Feeling tired even after getting sleep is definitely something we should look into. Now, let's talk about those hands. Where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: The pain is… everywhere. In the fingers, in the wrists, in the palms. When I try to hold the wrench, it is hard. I have to… squeeze very tight, and then it hurt more. Sometimes, it is… numb? Like when the hand sleep. But it is not sleep, is pain. Is worse in the morning, I think. Before coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to gently feel around your hands and wrists. Okay, I do notice a little bit of swelling in both wrists, and there’s some tenderness when I press here. And yes, some tenderness in the base of your fingers as well. Does this feel particularly painful?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… ow. That one. And that one. It is… achy. Like old bones. I work with cars for long time. Maybe the bones are just… tired too. But it is more than before. It is… constant, you know? Always there, little bit. And when I work, it is… much worse. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's significantly impacting your ability to do your work, and that's concerning. It’s good that you’re describing it so clearly. Okay, I'm checking your range of motion now... there’s some stiffness and a little bit of limitation when you bend your fingers and wrists. It doesn’t seem to be severely restricted, but it’s definitely noticeable. Let's move on to some other questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any swelling in any other joints – like your knees, ankles, or elbows?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. Not really. My knees… they sometimes creak, but that is old age again, yes? I do not think is swelling. And my elbows… no. No swelling. Just the hands. And maybe the wrists, but that is… with the hands. I do not think other places. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, just the hands and wrists. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you’re aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor tell me many years ago. I take pills for that. And… I had some problems with my gallbladder, I think. But they take it out. Many years ago. Other than that… no. Not much. I am pretty healthy, for old lady. I work hard all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and gallbladder removal. That’s helpful to know. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here. Is… Lisinopril, I think. And… Hydrochlorothiazide. Is that right? My son, he help me with the pills. Sometimes I forget. He make sure I have everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. That’s good. And you said your son helps you manage them, which is very helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat everything. I am Czech, we eat… everything. No problems. Never had allergy. My son, he is… careful. He ask me every time. But no, no allergies. I am lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And just one last question about your history. Have you ever had any major surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was little, for the… teeth. But nothing big. Nothing like now. Just the gallbladder. And teeth when I was little. That is all. I do not like surgery. I stay away from hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful. Now, before we continue, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had arthritis, I think. In her hands. Like me. Very bad. She could not… close her hands sometimes. My father… he had heart problems. But he smoke so much. Very bad habit. Other than that… not much. My brother… healthy. My sister… she live far away, I do not see her much. She is healthy too, I think. Is that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. So, your mother had arthritis, and your father had heart problems, likely related to smoking. Okay. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. Never. My father, he smoke too much, is why he get sick. I stay away from that. Bad habit. Never try it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Wine. With dinner. Not much. One glass. Maybe two. Is Czech custom, you know? But not every day. Not much alcohol. I do not drink like young people.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine with dinner. And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: I work with cars. Is… physical. But not like running. Is… lifting, bending, reaching. It is work. Before, I like garden, I like walk. Now, I mostly work. And sit. After work, I sit. I am tired. It is… not much activity now. I should walk more, I think. My son, he say that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, your work is physically demanding, but it doesn’t necessarily feel like exercise, and you've reduced some of your other activities. Alright. Now, Ms. Benites, I've asked a lot of questions, and I appreciate your patience. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam I’ve done, it sounds like you may be experiencing early symptoms of osteoarthritis in your hands, possibly also affecting your wrists. It's common, especially with a history of manual labor. The swelling and tenderness I felt, along with the pain and stiffness, are consistent with that. However, to be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few blood tests and an X-ray of your hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood tests? Is… bad? Is something serious? I thought is just old age. I do not like tests. But… if you think is necessary… yes. Okay. If you think is important, I do the tests. But is it going to hurt? Will I feel sick?
DOCTOR: No, no, it's not necessarily bad at all. It's just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The blood tests will help rule out other conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause similar symptoms. And the X-ray will show us the condition of the bones and joints in your hands. The blood test is just a small sample of blood taken from your arm—you might feel a tiny pinch, but it's very quick. And the X-ray is completely painless—you just need to hold still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. It doesn't involve any needles or anything like that. I want to be thorough, and these tests will help me make the best possible plan for you. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail, or shall we proceed with ordering them?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just… pinch. And picture. Okay. If you think is necessary, is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Just… do it quickly, if you can. I do not like hospitals. But… if it help, I do it. When can I do the tests? Is there… much waiting? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. I'll make sure the process is as quick and efficient as possible. The lab is right down the hall, and they usually don't have a long wait time. You can get the blood tests done anytime today. And the X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We'll send the results to me as soon as they're available, and I'll contact you to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to tolerate them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Tomorrow morning for the picture. And blood today. No problem. Ibuprofen… yes, I have some at home. My son, he tell me to take that sometimes. Is good. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I feel better now. Just… get it over with, if you can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. I'll have the nurse draw your blood right away, and we'll schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning. She'll give you all the necessary instructions. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe pain, or if you notice any redness or swelling, please don't hesitate to contact the office right away. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Benites, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
