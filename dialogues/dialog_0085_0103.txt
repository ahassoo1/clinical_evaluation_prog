DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back... it hurts. Low down, you know? Been hurting for a little while now. Not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. It makes it hard to stand for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower back. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a little while… can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Started slow, I thought it was just getting old. But it’s not getting better, Doctor. It’s… steady. Like a weight is always there. Not getting worse fast, but definitely not going away. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A steady ache that's been present for six months. And you mentioned it interferes with standing for long periods. Can you describe what activities specifically make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well, standing is bad. Walking isn't terrible, but long walks… no good. Sitting is okay for a bit, if I have a good chair. But getting up from sitting? Oof. That’s rough. And… bending over. Forget about bending over! I used to love gardening, but… not anymore. Does that help? I don’t know all the fancy words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. So, standing and prolonged walking aggravate it, bending over is difficult, and getting up from a seated position is particularly painful. Let’s talk a bit more about the pain itself. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It’s not too bad. Maybe a… four? Four out of ten. It's always there though, even when it's a four. It just gets higher when I move. Like when I sat down just now, it went up to maybe a six for a second. Then it settled back down. It's a sneaky pain, this one. It doesn't yell at you, it just… reminds you it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four out of ten typically, with flare-ups to a six when you change positions. That's helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? You mean… going down my legs? Not really. Sometimes I get a little… tingling in my feet, but not pain. Just… a little funny feeling. Like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn't happen all the time, and it goes away pretty quick. Not like a shooting pain or anything. I don't think so. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. And the tingling is good to know. Have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet, or any trouble with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not really. I feel a little slow getting up sometimes, but I figured that was just old age! My balance isn't the best, but I haven’t fallen or anything. And… no trouble with my bladder or bowels. Everything works… normal, I guess you could say. Sorry if that’s too much information! I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Vankampen, you’re being very helpful. It’s important information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, osteoporosis, or any other bone or joint conditions?
PATIENT: Osteoporosis… hmm. I think the last doctor mentioned something about my bones being a little thin. It was years ago, maybe ten years? He said I should take calcium. I tried for a while, but I forgot a lot of the time. I don’t remember a specific diagnosis, though. Arthritis… no, I don’t think so. I’ve had aches and pains, but nothing anyone ever said was arthritis. I've broken a bone, my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Does that help? I'm sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Knowing about the possible bone thinning and the broken arm as a child is helpful. And don't worry about your memory, we can take things slowly. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was young, that was a long time ago. And… oh! I had a hernia operation, maybe twenty years ago? Everything went fine, I don’t think it’s related to my back. Nothing else, not that I can remember. I’ve had a few teeth pulled, but I don’t count that as surgery. I’m a pretty healthy guy, usually. It’s just this back.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a hernia repair years ago. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have a history of back problems, arthritis, or osteoporosis?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had terrible arthritis in her hands. Real bad. Couldn’t even make a fist sometimes. And my sister… she had a bad back, too. Had to have surgery on it, I think. My father, he was pretty strong, never had much trouble with his back that I knew of. My kids… they seem alright so far, thank goodness. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. They don’t tell me everything!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and back problems in your sister. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once when I was young, didn’t like it. Bad for you, you know? My wife… she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. Thank goodness. Makes it hard to breathe, that stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy, just a small glass. Red wine, good for the heart, they say. I don't drink much more than that. Maybe a glass on special occasions, but mostly just with dinner. I'm not a big drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine with dinner. Now, and this is important, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a little calcium, sometimes. But I forget a lot. And… oh! I have something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. Just one every morning. That’s it, I think. Maybe I used to take something for my cholesterol, but I stopped. Honestly, Doctor, I have so many little bottles, it’s hard to keep track. My daughter helps me sometimes, but she’s busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, calcium occasionally and a medication for blood pressure. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, never had any trouble. I used to be allergic to dust, when I was a kid, but I grew out of that. I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Vankampen, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your back, see how your range of motion is, and do a few simple tests to see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are. I trust your judgment. It’s good to finally get this checked out. I’ve been putting it off for too long, probably. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could please lie down on your stomach for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It's a little hard to get comfortable, you know? Old bones aren't as flexible as they used to be. But I'm here. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to feel along your lower back here. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there… on the right side. That’s where it hurts the most. Not a sharp pain, more like a… deep ache. It's worse when you press on it, definitely. And… a little bit down here too, on the right side. It's not as bad, but I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, now I’m going to have you gently bend forward at the waist, keeping your legs as straight as comfortable. Just go as far as you can without pushing yourself. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not easy. It hurts, Doctor. It’s a dull ache, like a weight pulling on my back. Not sharp, but uncomfortable. I can’t go very far, you know? It feels like something is blocking me. I can feel it in my hamstrings too, a little bit. I’m stopping now, I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, if you could please roll over onto your back for me?
PATIENT: Okay. That's a little easier, actually. But my back still feels… sore. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to lift your right leg straight up, keeping it as straight as possible. Just let me know if you feel any pain down your leg as I do this. And now, your left leg.
PATIENT: That’s okay… a little stretch, but no pain. It feels a bit tight, but not bad. Ooh… that one’s a little tighter. I feel a little bit of tingling in my foot when you lift it. Not a sharp pain, just a funny feeling. Like when your foot falls asleep. It goes away when you lower it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That tingling is good to know. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Okay, and just a quick listen to your lungs, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. And yes, you can listen to my lungs. I used to smoke when I was young, but I quit a long time ago. They should be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Everything sounds clear. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a lumbar strain – a muscle injury in your lower back. The tenderness on the right side, the limited range of motion, and the tingling in your foot are consistent with that. However, the tingling does concern me a little, and the fact that it's been going on for six months warrants further investigation. I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back to rule out any underlying structural problems, like arthritis or a narrowed spinal canal. I also want to get some blood work done to check for inflammation and rule out other possible causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: X-rays and blood work… okay. That sounds… thorough. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do to fix it. Six months is a long time to be in pain. So, yes, let's do the X-rays and blood work. Do I need a referral for that? And… will that cost a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will write you a referral for the X-rays. We can have them done at the imaging center across the street. As for the cost, I understand your concern. The X-rays should be relatively inexpensive, and we can look into financial assistance programs if needed. The blood work will be a bit more, but we’ll keep it to the essential tests. I will also have my staff check with your insurance to see what is covered. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and applying ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. You can also try gentle stretching exercises, but stop if you feel any pain. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of the X-rays and blood work and develop a treatment plan. Does next Tuesday work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, that should be fine. Next Tuesday sounds good. And thank you for checking about the cost, Doctor. That’s a big relief. I appreciate that. Ibuprofen and ice… okay, I can do that. Gentle stretches, too, as long as they don’t hurt. So, referral for X-rays, blood work, ibuprofen, ice, gentle stretches, and follow-up next Tuesday. Is that everything? And… where do I go for the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything. You’ll receive a printed referral for the X-rays and a lab order for the blood work. For the blood work, you can go to the lab at St. Joseph’s Hospital, it’s on Main Street. And yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you check in. My staff will also give you a handout with information about lumbar strains and some exercises you can try. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it’s just a strain. I guess I’ll head home now and get started on the ice and ibuprofen. And I’ll make sure to schedule those tests. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, take it easy and listen to your body. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday.
