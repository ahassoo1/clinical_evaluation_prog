DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… travel stuff. I need… shots? My wife, she always took care of this. Now… I don’t remember where we go. Somewhere warm, I think. Before… you know. It was nice.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Travel stuff,” and you’re looking at getting some vaccinations. It sounds like you're planning a trip. And it’s alright if you don't remember the specifics right now. We can figure it out. Let me pull up your record here… Okay, Odell Tayar, age 22. It looks like you’ve been seen here before, just for routine checkups. Do you recall when your last tetanus shot was?
PATIENT: Tetanus? Is that… for when you cut yourself? I work with… metal. Lots of metal. But I don’t… remember any shots. Maybe a long time ago? Before… everything. I don't keep track of dates very well. Honestly, I’m just trying to get this over with so I can… go. Wherever it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It's very common to forget those dates. Working with metal does put you at higher risk for tetanus, which is why it's important to stay up-to-date. To get a better idea of what vaccinations you might need, could you tell me a little more about where you're planning to travel?
PATIENT: Like I said, warm. Beach. Lots of… trees, I think? She liked flowers. We went… somewhere with lots of people, but not… America. It was far away. Lots of… little shops. Food smells good. That’s all I really remember. Sorry. I wish I could… tell you more. It's just… a blur.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you and your wife enjoyed a lovely trip. And it’s perfectly alright that you're having trouble recalling specifics right now. A lot can affect memory. Given that it was somewhere warm, with beaches, flowers, and lots of people, and not in America, we need to consider a few possibilities. To be safe, and ensure you're protected, let's start with a few routine travel vaccines and boosters. Have you ever had a Hepatitis A vaccine?
PATIENT: Hep-a-what? No. Sounds… bad. Is that something I need? My wife… she always knew these things. I just… did what she said. Are you sure I need more stuff? It's just… a vacation. I don't want to spend the whole time sick from… all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Odell. It is a lot to think about. Hepatitis A is a viral infection you can get from contaminated food or water, and it's quite common in some tropical destinations. It's not usually severe, but it can certainly ruin a vacation, and it’s easily preventable with a vaccine. It's a one-time shot, and provides long-lasting protection. To help me narrow down what's best for you, could you tell me roughly when you last traveled?
PATIENT: Hmm… last travel… Before… she got sick. Maybe… a year? Six months? I’m really bad with time. It feels like a long time ago. We went every year, though. It was… important to her. We always went around… August. Like now, I guess. Does that help? Is there a way to just… skip this part? I don't like thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, around August of last year. That’s helpful. I understand this is difficult, and we don’t have to go through everything if you're uncomfortable. However, because you've traveled internationally within the last year, and you're unsure of your vaccination status, it’s best to err on the side of caution. Besides Hepatitis A, we should also consider Typhoid, and possibly a Tetanus booster, given your work with metal. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. She always asked, but I never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken… pills before, for headaches, but nothing serious. Just the over-the-counter kind. But she always handled all the… doctor stuff. I just trusted her. Is this going to take long? I have some things I need to… take care of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. We'll start with a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, and then we can administer the vaccinations. It shouldn't take too much longer. Could you roll up your sleeve for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… hurry, please? It makes me nervous, all this. She always made it seem easy. I… I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as quick as possible. Just a quick check, then the vaccinations. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rate is normal. Blood pressure is 118 over 76. Everything sounds good so far. Throat looks clear, ears are normal as well. Okay, everything seems alright. Now, for the vaccinations. We'll start with Hepatitis A, then the Tetanus booster. You might feel a slight pinch, and some soreness afterwards, but it shouldn't last long. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. Don’t… don't tell me when it's happening. Just do it. I… I really don't like this. And afterwards, can I just go? I need to… be somewhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. I understand. I'll let you know when I’m finished. Just focus on your breathing. Alright, all done. That was quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Yeah. Just… get me out of here. Can I just… go now? Is there anything else? I need to… go. I don't want to… stay.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're all set. Here's a sheet with information about potential side effects, like soreness at the injection site, and what you can do about it. You’re protected against Hepatitis A, and you’ve received a Tetanus booster. I do recommend following up with a primary care physician for routine checkups, but if you don’t have one, I can provide you with a list of doctors in the area. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I need to… go now.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care now, Odell. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
