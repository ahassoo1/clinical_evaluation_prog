DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ziccarelli. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is nice to meet you as well. Well, things just…not right. I been feeling very, very thirsty lately, no matter how much water I drink. And hungry too! Always hungry, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't make sense.
DOCTOR: I see. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even with adequate intake, is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. I think it start maybe…two, three months ago? Slow like. At first, I just thought it was the heat, you know? August heat can really take it outta you. But it didn't get better when the weather cool down a bit. That's when I start to worry. It just keep getting worse and worse.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Ziccarelli. A gradual onset is important. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes! I does feel tired all the time. More tired than usual, even after a good night sleep. And…oh, yes. I have to…go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Waking me up and everything. It’s a nuisance, really. I have to get up two, three times a night sometimes. It never used to be like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and frequent urination, particularly at night – those are important details. When you go to the bathroom, is it a large amount of urine each time, or just small amounts frequently?
PATIENT: Well, it not like a little dribble, Doctor. It a good amount each time. Not like a flood, but a proper amount, you know? Like when you drink a lot of water and then have to go. It just…more often. And always in the night, waking me up. My husband does complain he have to get up too, because I turning on the light. It's disrupting everyone's sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite disruptive, and we want to get to the bottom of this. Now, Ms. Ziccarelli, have you experienced any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… Now that you mention it… yes. A little bit blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but when I does read the newspaper, the letters does seem to…swim a little. I thought it was just my eyes getting old, you know? I’m sixty-three years old, Doctor. Things going to start failing eventually. But maybe it’s not just that?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Ms. Ziccarelli. Changes in vision can be very relevant. Do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Let me see… my mother’s sister, my Aunt Esme, she had it. A long time ago, she had to take…injections, I think. And my cousin, on my husband’s side, he had it too. Not a good thing, diabetes. A lot of trouble. I always try to eat healthy, you know? Avoid too much sugar. But it still worry me, if it run in the family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Ziccarelli. A family history of diabetes is certainly a risk factor. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what you need me to do. I not a fussy woman.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I'll take a quick look at your feet. Your feet look generally good, though I do notice some slight dryness. I will also test your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which can be common with age, but something we'll keep an eye on. Finally, I'm going to check your weight and height. Your BMI is 27.6, which puts you in the overweight category. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a blood glucose test and a complete metabolic panel. This will help us see your current blood sugar levels and assess your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and other important markers. Would you be willing to have some blood drawn today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I will do whatever you say. Blood tests is alright. I don’t mind a little pinprick if it will help find out what is wrong with me. I just want to feel normal again, you know? Always thirsty and running to the bathroom… it’s tiring. So yes, please do the blood tests. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ziccarelli. I understand your concerns, and we'll work towards getting you feeling better. The lab should be able to process the tests relatively quickly. I anticipate having the results back within 24 to 48 hours. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink fluids as you feel thirsty, but perhaps avoiding sugary drinks. While we wait for the lab results, it's also important to consider lifestyle factors. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I was feeling very worried. I will wait for the nurse to call with the results. And I will try to drink more water, not so much sweet drinks. Is that all for today?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Ziccarelli. I’m glad I could help ease your worries, even just a little. Yes, that is all for today. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before the nurse calls, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here is a copy of the lab requisition form and a brief summary of our discussion. Thank you for coming in, and I wish you a good day. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye, and may God bless you.
