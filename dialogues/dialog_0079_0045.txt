DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, please call me Enrique. It's... the flushing. My face gets very red sometimes. And my neck too. It started, oh... maybe a month ago? Not every day, but enough to worry me. It feels warm, you know? Not a fever warm, just… warm.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Flushing, you say. And it's been occurring for approximately one month. You describe a warm sensation, but no fever. Is this flushing associated with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Activity? Let me think... No, not really. It doesn’t seem to happen after exercise. I walk a little, but nothing big. It’s not after eating anything special either. I eat… normal food. Rice, dal, sometimes chicken. It just… happens. Sometimes when I'm reading. Sometimes just sitting. It's very strange. I don’t feel sick otherwise. Just the red face.
DOCTOR: Right. It appears to be rather spontaneous, then. No clear triggers identified at this point. And you state you otherwise feel well—no accompanying symptoms like headache, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no headache. Not dizzy. My heart… feels okay. Sometimes a little fast when I climb stairs, but everyone gets that, right? Not with the flushing though. It's just the red. And it’s… embarrassing. People look. My wife… she would always know when I was getting flushed, even before I did. She's gone now, though. Sorry. It just makes me think.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, we must focus on the present matter, Mr. Withycombe. To rule out any underlying causes, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other changes in your body recently—perhaps weight loss or gain, changes in bowel habits, or any new skin rashes or growths?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Weight is the same, I think. I eat pretty regular. Bowels are… normal, yes. No changes there. No rashes, no new bumps. Skin is… just skin. I haven't noticed anything different. I used to garden a lot, but… haven't done that since my wife passed. So, no scratches or anything. I really just worry about the red face, Doctor. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say without further investigation, Mr. Withycombe. We need to consider a range of possibilities. Do you have any known allergies—to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything my wife made, and she made a lot of things. Never had a reaction. I've never taken much medicine, either. Just… pain relievers sometimes, for my back. But nothing regular. I don’t think I'm allergic to anything. Dust maybe? I do cough a little when I clean. But everyone coughs, don't they?
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Like I said, I don't take much. I used to take something for my… blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. That was… years ago. I haven’t taken anything since. Just the occasional pain reliever, but not even once a month. I promise. I really try to stay away from those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and examine your skin. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I haven’t been on one of these in a long time. Is it… is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles at this stage, Mr. Withycombe. Just a standard blood pressure reading and a visual examination. Blood pressure cuff only. Relax your arm, please. And try to breathe normally. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you could please turn your head slightly, I'll examine your skin. There is some mild erythema noted on the cheeks and neck, consistent with your report of flushing. No obvious rashes or lesions present. Skin turgor appears normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn't bad. Slightly elevated? Is that… bad? My wife, she always said my blood pressure was good. She was a nurse, you know. Very good nurse. Erythema? Is that just… red? And what does skin turgor mean? I don't understand these words.
DOCTOR: Erythema simply means redness of the skin, Mr. Withycombe. And skin turgor refers to its elasticity – how quickly it returns to normal after being pinched. It’s a general assessment of hydration. Slightly elevated blood pressure is not necessarily alarming, but warrants monitoring. Given your symptoms and the findings of this examination, several possibilities need to be considered. It could be rosacea, a common skin condition, or perhaps a reaction to an unknown trigger. Less likely, but we must rule out underlying medical conditions. I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. This will help us to identify any potential underlying causes.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. How much will those cost? I… I don’t have insurance, you see. My wife, she had good insurance. But… since she passed… it’s just me now. I don't know if I can afford a lot of tests, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern regarding cost, Mr. Withycombe. Unfortunately, without these tests, a definitive diagnosis is difficult. We can discuss options for more affordable testing facilities, though the waiting times may be longer. Alternatively, we could consider a trial of treatment for rosacea, if you prefer, but it is not ideal without a proper diagnosis. The cost of these tests will likely be in the range of $300 to $500, depending on the facility. I can provide you with a list of local labs and their estimated prices.
PATIENT: $300 to $500? That… that’s a lot of money, Doctor. I just… I don’t know. Maybe… maybe it’s just something I have to live with? The red face? My wife used to say it meant I was thinking hard. I don't want to spend all my savings on tests if it’s just… rosacea. Is there anything else I can do? Anything at all? Can I try something at home first? Before spending so much money?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Withycombe. I understand your financial concerns. While a definitive diagnosis is preferable, we can attempt a conservative approach. I will recommend a gentle skincare regimen – a mild cleanser and a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Avoid harsh soaps, scrubbing, and excessive sun exposure. You can also try applying cool compresses to your face during periods of flushing. Here is a handout with detailed instructions. We will monitor your symptoms for the next four to six weeks. If there is no improvement, or if the flushing worsens, we will need to revisit the possibility of further testing. However, I must emphasize that this is not an ideal approach. It is simply a compromise given your circumstances. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay… a gentle skincare regimen. Cool compresses. I can do that. I used to garden, you know? I have some aloe vera. Maybe that would help? And aloe vera is cool, right? So, it would be like a cool compress? No, I don’t think I have any other questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. For trying to understand. I will try my best. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Withycombe. Do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any concerning changes. And please, follow the instructions carefully. Good day.
