DOCTOR: Hi Norval, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. What brings me in… hmm. It's mostly just, I don't get to feel full when I eat anymore. I eat a normal-sized plate, even a bit more sometimes, and I just…stop feeling hungry, but I haven't really eaten anything, you know? It's been going on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So you're saying you don't feel satisfied after eating what you'd normally consider a full meal, even when you eat a bit more?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly! It's like my stomach tells my brain it's had enough before it actually has. It’s… strange. I used to really enjoy a good meal, but now it’s just… not the same. I feel like I'm wasting food sometimes, 'cause I leave half my plate.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. And how long exactly has this been going on for – you said a few weeks, but can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started… oh, around the middle of July, maybe? So, a little over two weeks, I’d say. It didn’t start suddenly, it was kinda gradual. First just not finishing my plate, then leaving more and more. My wife, Elsie, she noticed it before I did, actually. She kept asking if I was feeling alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset in mid-July. And has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me see… Not that I can think of, really. No big changes in what I’m eating, no stress or anything. Elsie and I have been pretty quiet, just enjoying the summer. We did have a bit of a cold snap last week, but that’s about it. Oh! And young Thomas – that’s my grandson – he visited, but he left again. That was nice, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So no major life changes or increase in stress. Just the visit from your grandson and a bit of cooler weather. Now, are you having any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, sometimes I feel a little tired, but I'm 88, Doctor! Tired comes with the territory, right? No, really, not much else. Maybe a little bit of heartburn now and then, but that's happened on and off for years. Nothing new, and nothing too bad. I sleep alright, still get up to use the bathroom once a night, but that's been happening forever too.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional heartburn, but those seem to be ongoing issues. Do you notice any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No sickness, no… well, you know. Everything's moving along as it should, if you catch my drift. Elsie would know if something was off down there, and she hasn't said a word. She’s a good woman, Elsie. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And what about your appetite before this started?
PATIENT: Oh, good appetite. Always have. I always looked forward to a good plate of salmon and bannock. I never skipped a meal, you know? It's just… changed. Now I just don’t feel the same enjoyment, and I stop eating before I feel truly full. It's frustrating. Elsie makes such good food, and I hate wasting it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was alright after I had some tests. Just told me to take it easy. I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my knees, arthritis, you know. Old age, mostly. And I had the flu a couple of winters ago, but everyone gets the flu, right? Aside from that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble a few years ago, arthritis, and the flu. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed 'em. I always figured, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. My Elsie tried to convince me to get my cataracts done a while back, but I just didn't see the point. I can still see well enough, thank you very much. She worries too much, that woman. A good woman, but a worrier.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small, white one. Elsie makes sure I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it. Nothing fancy. I don’t like taking too many pills, if I can help it. They never taste very good, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years – berries, fish, everything you can imagine – and never had a problem. Elsie's always careful about what she cooks, so I trust her. She knows what's good for me. We've been married for 60 years, you know. She’s a good cook, and she keeps me out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. My mother, she lived to be 92, a strong woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father, he didn’t live as long, heart trouble, I think. My brother, he had diabetes, but he lived a good life. On Elsie’s side, her mother had arthritis, like me, and her father had high blood pressure, like me, it seems. Nothing too serious, really. A lot of good, strong people in both our families. Long lives, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few quick questions, just to get a better picture of things. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Never liked the smell of it. My father smoked, but I always stayed away from it. Elsie doesn’t smoke either. Always thought it was a waste of money, and bad for your health, of course. No, no smoking. Not for me.
DOCTOR: And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week. Elsie and I enjoy it with our salmon. Nothing heavy, just a little something to relax us. Not enough to cause any trouble, I don't think. We're pretty sensible about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a glass of wine occasionally. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your social situation?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I’m married to Elsie. She’s my best friend. We live in town, quiet little place. We see our family sometimes, our grandchildren visit when they can. We go to the community center occasionally, play a bit of bingo. Mostly, we just enjoy each other's company. We don't get out much these days, but we’re happy. Very happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval, that's very helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to see if I can get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not as spry as I used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished, consistent with age. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Mildly decreased bowel sounds auscultated. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but the decreased bowel sounds and your symptoms… I’m a little concerned about potential early satiety. Now, do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Early…what did you call it? Satiety? That's a big word, Doctor. It sounds… serious. And the bowel sounds… are they supposed to be loud? Elsie always says my stomach rumbles, but I figured that was just because I like to eat. Is something wrong? You sound a little worried.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Early satiety just means feeling full sooner than you normally would. It can be caused by a lot of things, some simple, some more complex. Your decreased bowel sounds just mean that the normal activity in your digestive system is a little slower than usual. Now, it's not necessarily serious, but it could indicate something going on, so we need to investigate further. Possible causes could include things like gastritis, a slow-emptying stomach, or, less likely, something more concerning. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood work, just to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. I also recommend a stool test to check for any infections. And finally, I’d like to order an upper endoscopy – a simple procedure where we look at the lining of your stomach with a small camera – to rule out anything obvious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work I can handle, and a stool test isn’t too bad, I suppose. But an… endoscopy? That sounds… invasive. What does it involve exactly? And is it painful? I've never had any procedures like that before. Elsie won't be too happy if I go poking around inside my stomach with a camera. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Norval. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about a procedure you haven't had before. An upper endoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end being gently inserted down your throat to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine. It allows us to look for any abnormalities, like inflammation, ulcers, or polyps. The procedure itself is usually quick, lasting about 15-30 minutes. You’ll be given a sedative to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. Most people don’t remember much of it afterwards. There can be some mild cramping or a sore throat afterwards, but it's usually manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. While it's not absolutely necessary at this point, it’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and rule out anything serious. Given your symptoms and age, it’s important to be thorough. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail, and if you're still uncomfortable, we can explore other options, though they might not be as accurate. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it all to me. The risks, the benefits… everything. And what if I just…wait and see? Could it be something that will just go away on its own? I'm not keen on having a camera poked down my throat, if I can avoid it. I'm an old man, Doctor, and I’ve lived a good life. I don't want to go through anything unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval, I completely understand your concerns. Let’s talk about the risks and benefits of the upper endoscopy, and then we’ll discuss waiting and seeing. Benefits: An upper endoscopy gives us a direct view of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It can accurately diagnose the cause of your early satiety, such as gastritis, ulcers, or a blockage. It also allows us to take a biopsy if needed, which can help determine the severity of any abnormalities. Having a definitive diagnosis allows us to start the appropriate treatment and prevent any complications. Risks: The risks are relatively low, but they do exist. The most common risks include sore throat, bloating, and mild cramping. More serious, but rare, complications include bleeding, infection, and perforation . We take every precaution to minimize these risks, including using sterilized equipment and carefully monitoring you during the procedure. Now, regarding waiting and seeing… it’s possible that your symptoms could go away on their own, but it's also possible that they could worsen or indicate a more serious underlying condition that requires treatment. Without a diagnosis, we can’t rule out things like stomach cancer, which is more common in older adults. If we choose to wait and see, I would recommend regular check-ups and monitoring your symptoms closely. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms like weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or bloody stools, you need to seek immediate medical attention. However, given your age and the potential for a more serious underlying condition, I strongly recommend proceeding with the upper endoscopy. It’s the most accurate way to get a diagnosis and ensure your health. I want you to make an informed decision, Norval. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Well… Elsie always says I worry too much. And you're right, waiting might just mean something gets worse and then it's harder to fix. And… I don't want to worry Elsie. Alright, Doctor. Do the endoscopy. But… could I have Elsie with me? Just to hold my hand, maybe? And… what exactly will happen on the day of the procedure? What do I need to do to prepare? I need to know everything.
DOCTOR: That's a very brave decision, Norval. And absolutely, Elsie is more than welcome to be with you. Having a familiar face there for support can make a big difference. Let’s talk about what to expect on the day of the procedure. First, you’ll need to fast for at least six hours before the procedure. This means no food or drinks, including water. You can take your usual medications, unless I tell you otherwise. When you arrive at the clinic, we'll go over the procedure again and answer any questions you have. Then, a nurse will insert an IV line to administer the sedative. You'll lie on your left side, and we'll gently insert the endoscope down your throat. During the procedure, we'll carefully examine your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. We may take a biopsy if we see anything concerning. The entire procedure usually takes about 15-30 minutes. After the procedure, you'll remain in the recovery room for about an hour while we monitor you. You may feel drowsy or have a mild sore throat. You won't be able to drive for the rest of the day, so Elsie will need to drive you home. We'll discuss the results of the procedure with you as soon as they're available. I'll give you a detailed set of instructions to follow before the procedure. Do you have any other questions about the preparation or the procedure itself?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Six hours fasting, Elsie to drive… and a bit of a sore throat. Sounds… manageable. Alright, Doctor. Let’s schedule it. The sooner it's over, the better. And thank you. For explaining everything so clearly, and for letting Elsie come with me. It helps to know someone's there. Now, what's the next step?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me see… we can schedule it for next Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM. Does that work for you and Elsie?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, that should be fine. Elsie has bingo on Wednesday, so Tuesday is good. 9:00 AM, alright. Yes, 9:00 AM next Tuesday. Let’s do it. Now, is there anything I need to bring with me besides Elsie? A book, maybe? Something to distract me while I wait?
DOCTOR: That's a good idea, a book might be helpful. You might want to bring a list of your medications, just in case. Otherwise, just yourself and Elsie. We have magazines in the waiting room, but you're welcome to bring anything that will help you relax. I’ll have my assistant schedule the appointment and give you a detailed set of instructions. She’ll also give you information about how to prepare for the procedure and what to expect afterwards. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Norval?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's everything. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate it. Thank you again, for everything. And tell your assistant to let Elsie know when it’s scheduled, so she can clear her bingo schedule. It’s a very important game, you know. I think I’ll head home now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. You're very welcome. And I will definitely let her know about the bingo! Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before Tuesday. And give Elsie my best. Have a good day, Norval.
