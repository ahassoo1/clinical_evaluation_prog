DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It's August 2nd, 2025. I see you’re here today. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it’s a bit of a thing. My hearing… it goes funny sometimes. And I get real dizzy. It’s hard to explain, it just… happens. My daughter, she filled out a lot of the forms, bless her. I don't remember all the details now. It’s been going on for a bit, and my husband… well, he had something similar, that's why I came.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It’s helpful that your daughter assisted with the forms. We can certainly explore this further together. When you say “funny,” could you describe exactly what happens with your hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not always the same. Sometimes it just… mumbles. Like everyone’s talking under water. Other times, it's like a rushing sound, really loud in one ear, and then… nothing. Just quiet. It doesn't last long, usually. Maybe a few minutes, sometimes a bit longer. It's just… unsettling, you know? And then the spinning… oh, the spinning is the worst. Makes me want to lie right down.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those sounds are concerning, and the dizziness is certainly unpleasant. Just to clarify, when you say the rushing sound is in one ear, is it always the same ear, or does it switch?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it. Let me see… I think it’s usually the left one, but… honestly, Doctor, when it happens, I'm just trying to hold onto something. It's all a bit of a blur when the room starts going. It could be the right ear sometimes, I just… don’t really know for sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you aren't certain; we'll gather more information to help us understand. Approximately how long has this been occurring—both the muffled hearing and the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s hard to say. A few months, I think? Maybe longer. It comes and goes, you see. There’ll be a good stretch where everything is fine, and then… wham. It hits. My daughter says it’s been happening more often lately, which is why she pushed me to come in. She’s a good girl, always looking out for me. I suppose it’s been… worse this past month or so? It’s hard to keep track. Everything blends together, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like it's been a gradual onset, with increasing frequency recently. Do you notice anything specific that triggers these episodes – any particular movements, positions, or situations that seem to bring them on?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tricky one. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn’t seem to matter if I’m sitting, standing, or walking. I was gardening last week, and nothing happened then. I bent down to pick up a tomato, and then the room started spinning! But maybe it was just a coincidence. Honestly, Doctor, it feels completely random. Sometimes it happens when I’m just relaxing in my chair. It's quite frightening, to be truthful. Makes me worry about falling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about falling. Random occurrences can certainly be unsettling. Let’s move on to some other questions to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing changes and dizziness, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, or any vision problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach when it's happening. Not proper vomiting, just… queasy. And I get a bit of a headache afterwards, a dull ache really. Nothing too bad. My vision is… well, I need new glasses, to be honest. Everything is a bit blurry, but that’s just old age, I think. I don’t think that’s related. No, nothing else that I can think of, Doctor. Just the hearing and the spinning and feeling a bit off.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears – even when you aren't experiencing an episode of muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… now you mention it… yes, sometimes. A faint ringing, like a high-pitched whine. It’s not constant, and I usually don't even notice it unless it's quiet. It's just… there. Like a little buzzing in the background. It doesn't bother me too much, but it’s there. It's funny, I hadn’t even thought to mention it before. I just figured it was… old age again! Everything seems to be ‘old age’ these days.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know. Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. I have high blood pressure, the doctor keeps telling me to watch my salt. And I had my gallbladder removed years ago, must be twenty years now. Oh, and arthritis, in my knees mostly. It makes walking a bit painful sometimes. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. And I’m on medication for the blood pressure, of course. A little pill every morning.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question, Doctor. My daughter manages my pills, she fills up those little boxes every week. I just take what she gives me. I think… it's a small white one? And another pink one? I honestly couldn’t tell you the name, I'm terrible with names. Would my daughter have listed it on those forms? I just… don't want to give you the wrong information. I'm sorry. It's all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We can certainly check the forms. Ah, yes, it looks like you’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily, and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. Have you experienced any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, yes, that rings a bell! Bless her, my daughter. No allergies, not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medication before. And no allergies to anything else, either. Food, dust, animals… everything seems to be fine. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I think. Although, I do get a bit itchy sometimes after gardening, but that’s probably just the plants. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, could you tell me about any surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had in the past, besides the gallbladder removal you mentioned?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, nothing else. Just the gallbladder, years and years ago. I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that was a long time ago, and they just put a cast on it. Nothing major. I haven't been in the hospital since the gallbladder, I don't think. I try to stay out of hospitals, if I can! They're not a very pleasant place, are they?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a bit sad, to be honest. My husband, God rest his soul, he had those… dizzy spells too. The doctor said something about his inner ear, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. And my mother, she had high blood pressure, like me. And my sister, she had… something with her heart. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. I don't pay much attention to those medical things, I just try to keep going. It's just... sad, remembering all of that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s understandable that it’s difficult to recall details and that it’s upsetting to think about family illnesses. We don't need to go into great detail if it’s too painful. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, well... I live on my own now, since my husband passed. I keep busy with gardening, mostly. I enjoy reading, when my eyes are up to it. And I go to church every Sunday. I try to stay active, but my knees… well, they don’t cooperate sometimes. I used to walk more, but it’s gotten harder lately. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner, maybe a glass or two. I don’t really go out much, just stay close to home. Quiet life, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Mayhugh. That's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to take a look in your ears. We'll also do a few simple balance tests. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle with my knees, they get a bit creaky sometimes. And… please don’t shine a bright light in my eyes, it bothers me a bit. Other than that, I'm ready when you are. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears. Your ears appear generally normal, just a little wax build-up. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. And finally, I'll check your gait. Would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There we go...slowly, slowly. My knees are a bit creaky, you see. Hope I didn’t make a mess of it. It’s harder than it looks!
DOCTOR: You did very well, Ms. Mayhugh. No mess at all. The creakiness is noted, and your gait appears stable, although slightly cautious. The mild nystagmus I observed is something we’ll need to investigate further. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, the most likely cause of your symptoms is a condition called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV for short. It’s a common inner ear problem that causes brief episodes of dizziness triggered by changes in head position. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to get a hearing test, and an MRI of your brain?
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? Is that… is that going to be unpleasant? I’ve never had one of those before. I’m not very good with enclosed spaces, you see. And a hearing test… will that involve loud noises? My ears are a bit sensitive. I… I don’t know. Are there other options? Perhaps we could just… try something else first? I’m a bit worried about all these tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Mayhugh, and I want to assure you that we'll take things at your pace. The MRI is often the best way to rule out more serious causes, like a tumor or stroke, but we don’t have to do it immediately. As for the hearing test, yes, it does involve listening to tones at different frequencies and volumes, but it is not painful, and we can adjust the volume to your comfort. Given your anxiety, let’s start with the hearing test first. It will give us more information, and we can discuss the MRI after we have those results. If the hearing test is normal, and your symptoms aren't severe, we could try a simple maneuver called the Epley maneuver, which often helps reposition the crystals in your inner ear and relieve the dizziness. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… better. The Epley maneuver sounds less frightening than being stuck in a machine. And a hearing test I can manage, if it won't be too loud. Yes, let's start with that. And… you promise we can talk about the MRI afterwards? I don't want to feel pressured into doing something I'm not comfortable with. So… where do we go from here? Do I need to make an appointment?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We will certainly talk about the MRI afterwards, and you won't be pressured into anything. You are in control of your healthcare. Yes, let’s schedule you for a hearing test with the audiologist. I’ll write you a referral now. You can call them to schedule an appointment at your convenience. Their number is on the referral. After the hearing test, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, so we can discuss the results and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, to help prevent falls, I recommend avoiding sudden head movements and making sure your home is well-lit. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. Avoiding sudden movements, yes, I can do that. And I’ll call the audiologist right away. Hmm… let me see. Oh, yes! What causes this BPPV, you said? Are the crystals something I’m supposed to avoid eating? And is it… contagious?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Mayhugh! The cause of BPPV is often unknown, but it’s thought to be related to tiny calcium crystals in your inner ear becoming dislodged. It's not related to anything you eat, so you don't need to avoid any specific foods. And thankfully, it’s not contagious! It happens when those crystals move around in the inner ear, causing temporary interference with your balance signals. The Epley maneuver helps reposition those crystals back where they belong. It's a very safe procedure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a relief! Not from my diet, that’s good. And not contagious, even better! Crystals moving around… well, it still sounds a bit strange, but… yes, I think I understand. So the maneuver… will you be doing that here? Or do I need to go somewhere else? And how long does it take? I have a bit of a drive home, and I don’t want to be feeling dizzy while I’m on the road.
DOCTOR: I'm glad that clarifies things. We can certainly perform the Epley maneuver here in the office, Ms. Mayhugh, if the hearing test results are consistent with BPPV. It usually takes just a few minutes to perform, but you may feel some brief dizziness during the procedure. We’ll keep you here for a little while afterwards to make sure you’re feeling stable before you head home. I’ll also give you some instructions to follow after the maneuver to help prevent recurrence, like avoiding lying flat for a few hours and sleeping with your head slightly elevated. I want to ensure your journey home is safe and comfortable. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring, Doctor. Waiting until I’m stable before I leave is a good idea. And I’ll definitely follow those instructions – avoiding lying flat, yes, I can manage that. Well, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient with my questions. I feel a lot better now, knowing what’s going on. I'll call the audiologist right away. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It was my pleasure to help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again after your hearing test. Have a safe drive home!
