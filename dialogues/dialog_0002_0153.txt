DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Ranjan, is it? Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… a performance, I think. It’s all a bit foggy, honestly. They sent me over from… somewhere. A lot of running around, you know how it is. I just want to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A bit of running around can be confusing. No worries, we’ll get through this. So, just to clarify – you were sent here for a general check-up, perhaps related to a performance you’re involved in?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. A performance… I used to… well, I do work at the theater. Ushering, mostly. And taking tickets. Lobby stuff. Not… on stage, usually. Though I’ve… filled in, now and then. It’s all a bit blurry, though. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, ushering and ticket-taking at the theater – good to know. And filling in when needed, that’s great! We’ll try to keep this as quick as possible. Just to get a better picture, when you say things are blurry, are you referring to your memory, or are you experiencing any other kind of fuzziness – like vision changes, or feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, both, I suppose. The memory is… patchy. Very patchy. And sometimes… my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Not terribly bad, mind you. Just… not as sharp. Everything feels a little… distant. But I’ve been like this for a while. It’s just… gotten a bit worse lately, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, patchy memory and some blurry vision that's been worsening recently. That’s helpful. To get a better understanding of the memory issues, can you give me an example of something you're having trouble remembering?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Just yesterday… someone told me about a schedule change. For… my shifts. At the theater. And I… I can’t recall the details. When it was, what time… anything. I had to ask them to repeat it three times, and even then… I’m not sure I got it right. It’s little things like that. Small things. But they add up, you know? It’s frustrating. Really frustrating. I used to have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: I understand how frustrating that must be, especially when you're used to having a good memory. Okay, so difficulty remembering a recent schedule change, even after repetition. Let's talk a bit more about the vision changes. When did you first notice them, and are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe a year ago? It started gradually. Things just didn’t seem as… crisp. As clear. At first, I thought it was just my age, you know? But it’s gotten… more noticeable. It’s pretty constant, I think. Though sometimes it's worse than others. Especially in low light. It’s hard to see faces clearly. And reading is… difficult. I really don't like asking people to repeat things. Makes me feel… useless.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, and you're not useless at all. It takes courage to come in and get things checked out. Okay, so blurry vision for about a year, gradually worsening, constant, and worse in low light, making reading difficult. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I haven’t really… been to the doctor much. I always figured I was healthy enough. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… things like that. But nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions… not that I remember. I think I had my blood pressure checked once, years ago. It was… normal, I think. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… a mess. It’s like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll do our best to piece things together. It's common for people to not have a lot of detailed medical history, especially if they've been generally healthy and haven't seen a doctor often. Okay, so no major surgeries, no chronic conditions that you recall, and childhood illnesses like measles and mumps. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Let me think… No. No, I don’t think so. Never been in the hospital. Not even when I was a child. A few stitches here and there, when I was a boy, climbing trees, being foolish. But never hospitalized. My wife… she used to handle all the medical stuff. Appointments, bills… everything. It’s been a long time since… well, since then. I really wish I could remember more. This is so frustrating.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Krahn. Don't worry about remembering everything. It’s perfectly okay. We’ll proceed as best we can. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife used to make me all sorts of things… spicy dishes, seafood… I never had a problem. And I don’t take any medications regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then, for a headache. But that’s it. Wait… I think I once had a rash after using a new laundry detergent. But it wasn’t serious. Just a little itchy. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, food allergies, just a mild rash with a new laundry detergent. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. That’s… another difficult one. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. Both… old age, I think. My mother… she had some sort of… heart trouble, maybe? I don’t remember the details. And my father… he was always very healthy. Strong as an ox. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. She lives… somewhere far away. I don’t know anything about her health. Honestly, Doctor, I wasn’t very close to my family. I always kept to myself, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, both parents passed away from old age, mother possibly had heart trouble, and you haven't had contact with your sister for a long time. That’s alright, it’s common not to have detailed family history information. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no. No smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And very little alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing more. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested. I always preferred a quiet evening at home, reading… or going to the theater. A nice, peaceful life. I always believed in moderation. Everything in moderation.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no smoking, very little alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Now, Mr. Krahn, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological exam. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam. Yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do, you know. But yes. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. It won’t take long. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination appears intact, though a little slow. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Okay, Mr. Krahn, everything seems generally okay, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation. The slowed coordination could be related to a number of things, and we’ll want to look into that as well.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Investigation? What sort of investigation? Is it something serious? I don’t like the sound of that. I just wanted a simple check-up. I’m not a sick man, Doctor. I just… forget things. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Is that all?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Mr. Krahn. "Investigation" just means we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll start with some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. We can also consider an EKG to get a better look at your heart function. And perhaps a referral to an ophthalmologist to evaluate your vision. These are just precautionary measures, to be thorough. We need to determine the cause of the elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and the slowed coordination. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. I don’t like tests. And I don’t want to bother anyone with all this. I’m sure it’s nothing. Just old age, maybe? What sort of blood work? Will it take a lot of blood? And an… ophthalmologist? Is that someone who looks at your eyes? What if they find something bad? I just want to go home, Doctor. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn, and I’ll do my best to make the process as comfortable as possible. The blood work is pretty standard – just a few vials of blood to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important markers. It won’t take much blood, and we have a very experienced phlebotomist who is skilled at making it as painless as possible. And yes, an ophthalmologist is a doctor who specializes in eye care. They can thoroughly evaluate your vision, check for any underlying conditions like glaucoma or cataracts, and prescribe glasses if needed. If they find anything concerning, they’ll discuss it with you and recommend appropriate treatment. We’re not looking for anything bad, Mr. Krahn, just trying to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. We need to gather information before we can make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan. Would you like me to explain the blood tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… all those words. Cholesterol… glaucoma… It’s all very confusing. I suppose… I suppose I can get the blood work done. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And I’ll see… I’ll see about the eye doctor. But I really don’t want to know if there’s something bad wrong. Sometimes… sometimes it’s better not to know. Just… just tell me what I need to do. And then I can go home. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn. I understand. We’ll start with the blood work. I'll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and the results should be back in a few days. I’ll also give you a referral to a local ophthalmologist. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work. And here’s the referral to Dr. Lee, a very good ophthalmologist in town. Once you have the blood work results, please call my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call us. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I suppose. It’s been… stressful. I just want to go home now. And hopefully… hopefully everything will be alright. I really don't want to be a bother. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. And you're not a bother at all. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye, Mr. Krahn. I hope you have a pleasant evening.
