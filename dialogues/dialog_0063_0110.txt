DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, I would appreciate it.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Nicoletta McNabb, but everyone calls me Nicoletta. Well, to put it simply, I feel…old. Not in a complaining way, you understand. Just…like I need a little boost. A reset, perhaps. I’ve been a teacher for many years – kindergarten and elementary – and I think all that energy finally caught up with me. I want to feel more like myself again, if that makes sense. It’s just…getting a little harder, you know?
DOCTOR: “Feeling old,” is rather vague, Ms. McNabb. We need specifics. Are we talking about fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, of course. Vague is no good. Fatigue, yes, definitely fatigue. But also…a little less spring in my step, if you know what I mean? And my memory isn't what it used to be, though I wouldn’t say it’s bad. Just…not as quick. I forget little things, names mostly. It’s probably just age, but I wanted to get your opinion. Is that more helpful?
DOCTOR: Names…yes. Well, most people forget names. Let’s focus on the fatigue. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It didn't happen all at once. It was…gradual. Perhaps six months ago, maybe a little longer? I started noticing it around the end of the school year last year. It was a particularly busy one, lots of little ones needing extra help. I just chalked it up to being tired from work, honestly. But it hasn’t really gone away, even with the summer break. Do you need a specific date? I’m not very good with those things anymore, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Approximately six months... And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a thoughtful question. Hmmm… not really, not that I've noticed. The heat, perhaps? We had a particularly warm spring and summer. It always makes me feel a little sluggish. And… well, sometimes when I’m trying to do too much. I still volunteer at the community center a couple of times a week. I help with the reading program for the children. I enjoy it, very much, but maybe it's too much? I don't know. It's hard to say. I'm a busy woman, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any difficulty with sleep, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's something I hadn’t even thought to mention. Not difficulty falling asleep, thankfully. But I wake up several times during the night. Not always for a specific reason. Sometimes I just… wake up. And then it’s hard to get back to sleep. I’ve tried warm milk, chamomile tea, those sorts of things, but they don’t always help. It's not every night, mind you, but it happens often enough to leave me feeling tired in the mornings. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. I've been taking it for… oh, maybe ten years now? It seems to be doing its job, my doctor checks it regularly. Aside from that, nothing. Just vitamins, occasionally. A multivitamin, when I remember to buy them. Nothing specific, like for sleep or anything. I prefer to avoid taking too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve always been very lucky that way. No reactions to any medication I’ve ever taken, as far as I know. And no food allergies either. Chamorro food can be quite spicy, you know, but I’ve always been able to handle it! I’ve never had any trouble with allergies at all, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. It won’t take long. Please, have a seat and relax.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready whenever you are. I always trust your professional opinion. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82… acceptable, but could be better. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Now, let’s review your recent lab work… Your thyroid levels are within normal limits. Vitamin D is a bit low, but not drastically so. Complete blood count is unremarkable.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring to hear, Doctor. Everything sounds…normal. So what does that mean, exactly? If everything is normal, why am I feeling so…tired? And forgetting things? Is there something else we should be looking at? I apologize for asking so many questions, but it's just… this is all a little worrying. I want to get back to feeling like myself, you know? I have a reading program to run, and little ones depend on me.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. McNabb, it appears your lab work doesn’t indicate any major underlying medical conditions. It could be…age-related fatigue. It's common. A low Vitamin D can contribute to fatigue, so I’ll prescribe a supplement. However, given your concerns about memory, I would recommend a cognitive assessment. It's a simple test, administered by a specialist, to evaluate your cognitive function. And, frankly, a consultation with a neurologist might be prudent. They can rule out any neurological causes for your memory lapses. I can provide you with a referral.
PATIENT: A neurologist… oh dear. That sounds…serious, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? I understand you’re just being thorough, but it’s a little frightening to think of. And a cognitive assessment… will that involve a lot of difficult tests? I don't want to be put on the spot. I just want to feel better, not be made to feel… less capable. Perhaps the vitamin supplement is enough? I’m just a little worried about going down a rabbit hole of tests and specialists if it’s just…age, like you said.
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, I understand your apprehension. However, it is important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. A cognitive assessment is a non-invasive test, simply a series of questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It is not a pass-fail test, and will not make you feel less capable. It is a precautionary measure. I would recommend a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Here is the referral information. It’s best to err on the side of caution. And I am prescribing Vitamin D 2000 IU daily. Take it with food. Do you have any further questions, Ms. McNabb?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it's best… I suppose I should see Dr. Ramirez. It’s just… it all feels a bit overwhelming. I’ve always been a healthy woman. Is there anything I should do between now and my appointment? Anything to help with the fatigue? Or the…forgetfulness? Aside from taking the vitamin, of course. Perhaps a good night’s sleep? A change in diet? Any suggestions would be appreciated. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, maintain a healthy diet, ensure adequate hydration, and prioritize sleep. Regular, gentle exercise can also be beneficial. Beyond that, there's not much I can suggest without further evaluation. I am running behind schedule, so I will need to conclude the consultation. Here is a summary of our discussion and the referral information. If you do not schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez within the next month, I suggest we revisit this matter. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I understand. Thank you for your time. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Have a good day, Doctor. .
