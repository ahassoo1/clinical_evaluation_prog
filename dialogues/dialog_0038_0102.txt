DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Neeraj, you said? A nice name. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s a bit hard to say exactly. I just… been sighing a lot lately. And taking deep breaths, I guess. Not sure why. Feels…old, maybe? Old feelings. It’s not painful, just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine. "Sighing a lot" and taking deep breaths, and you feel like it’s related to…well, just feeling old, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Feeling old. My wife… she passed a few years back now. Lovely woman. It's not like I’m sad all the time, you understand? Just… sometimes it comes over me. A feeling… a heaviness. And then I sigh. A big sigh.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Vantine. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can manifest in many ways, even years later. It's perfectly normal to still be experiencing waves of emotion. And it sounds like this sighing is connected to those feelings. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you've been noticing this sighing?
PATIENT: When… hmm. That’s a good question. Not all the time, no. Seems to be… when I'm quiet, mostly. When I’m alone. Sometimes if I’m remembering things… good things, or… not so good. It's hard to pinpoint. Not during the day much, when I'm busy. It's more… evening time, I think. Before bed, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly in the evenings, when you’re quiet and alone, and sometimes triggered by memories. That’s helpful. And you said it’s not painful, just…a heaviness and a sigh. Do you notice anything else happening when you sigh?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… my chest feels a little tight. Not a bad tight, just… constricted. And I get a little… shaky, maybe. My hands, you know? Not a lot, but enough to notice. And… well, this might sound silly… but I feel a little… lost. Like something’s missing.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound silly at all, Mr. Vantine. It's very common to feel lost after a significant loss. And the chest tightness and shakiness are also things we need to pay attention to. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Not really. I eat okay, I think. Not as much as I used to, but that’s probably just getting older. Sleep’s… not the best, but who sleeps well these days? And I… well, I don’t get out much anymore. Mostly just stay home. Everything feels a bit… much, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, appetite is a little reduced, sleep isn’t great, and you’re not as active as you used to be. And you mentioned everything feels a bit overwhelming. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like heart problems, lung problems, anxiety, or depression?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Let me see… the doctor, back in Cambodia, he said my heart was strong. That was a long time ago, though. I haven’t really been to a doctor since I came here. No lung problems, not that I know of. And… I don’t think I’ve ever been told I had anxiety or… what was the other one? Depression. No, I don’t think so. Just… sad sometimes. But everyone gets sad, right?
DOCTOR: That’s right, everyone gets sad sometimes. Okay, so no formal diagnoses of heart conditions, lung problems, anxiety or depression. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes, when I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… a long, long time ago. Back in Cambodia, it was a small hospital. And… I think I had my tonsils out too, but I’m not sure. It was so long ago, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and possibly tonsil removal, both a long time ago. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s a hard question. I haven’t seen my family in… well, too long to remember. My father, he had a bad heart, I think. But he was a smoker, you know? My mother… she just… got old. It was a long time ago. Not much talking about these things back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a father with heart problems, possibly related to smoking, and a mother who passed away with age-related causes. Now, just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life. A little headache now and then, that’s all. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I think I'm pretty strong, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're currently not taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No medications. Just… trying to get by.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a general look. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine, everything sounds pretty good. Your heart rhythm is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern, especially given your age. Your lungs are clear, and your reflexes and balance are normal. Your blood pressure is a little high, which we’ll want to keep an eye on. I’m also noticing you appear slightly… withdrawn, and your affect is a little subdued. I want to explore this a little further. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about how you’ve been feeling emotionally, aside from the sighing?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I suppose… I’ve just been… lonely, Doctor. It's quiet in the house, you know? Too quiet. My wife… she did all the talking. And now… it’s just me. Sometimes I feel… useless, like I don't have a purpose anymore. I used to work, you know. First-Line Supervisors of Police and Detectives. Important work, back then. But now…
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Mr. Vantine. Losing your wife and feeling a loss of purpose after a fulfilling career… it’s understandable that you’re feeling lonely and withdrawn. Those are very valid feelings. I'm concerned that you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. It’s not uncommon, especially after a significant loss and life changes. Now, I want to be clear: I'm not making a diagnosis at this moment. But I do think it would be helpful to explore this a little further. I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your mood, your sleep, your appetite, and your energy levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s alright. Ask me whatever you need to. I just want to feel… better. If you can help, I’m happy to answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine. Let's start with your sleep. You mentioned it’s not the best. On average, how many hours of sleep do you get each night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It varies. Some nights I toss and turn all night, barely getting four or five hours. Other nights… maybe six, if I’m lucky. But it's not good sleep, you know? I wake up feeling tired, still. And I get up a few times during the night to… just wander around. Thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally four to six hours of restless sleep. And you wake up feeling tired. Now, how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Well, I eat… but not much. I don’t really feel hungry anymore. I used to love my wife’s cooking, but now… I just make something simple. Soup, maybe. Or a sandwich. I don't have much of an appetite, to be honest. Lost my taste for it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite and a loss of enjoyment in food. Now, have you been finding that you’ve lost interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I used to love gardening, you know? Had a beautiful garden. But now… I haven’t touched it in months. It’s all overgrown, I suppose. And I used to like watching the news, keeping up with things. But now… it just makes me feel sad, you know? So I don’t bother anymore. Everything feels… pointless.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you’ve told me – the sighing, the loneliness, the loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, the reduced sleep and appetite, and the feeling of pointlessness – it sounds like you may be experiencing a period of significant depression. Now, I want to be clear: I'm not making a definitive diagnosis at this moment. But I do think it would be beneficial to explore this further and consider some treatment options. I'd like to order a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. And I also think it would be helpful for you to speak with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A blood test… and talking to someone? Well… I suppose so. If it might help. I don’t want to be a bother. And I… I don’t really like talking about my feelings. But… if you think it's best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t want to feel worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Vantine. It takes courage to talk about these things, and it’s perfectly okay to feel uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it would be helpful. The blood test is just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And speaking with a mental health professional doesn’t mean you have to spill your life story right away. It’s a safe space to explore your feelings at your own pace. I’m going to write you a referral to a local therapist, Dr. Eleanor Vance. She has a lot of experience working with older adults and grief. I’ll also order the blood test for you. In the meantime, I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself. It’s okay to not be okay. And remember that you’re not alone. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. A referral… and the blood test. I’ll… I’ll try to make an appointment with Dr. Vance. Thank you. I appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could help, even if it’s just by listening. Here’s the referral information for Dr. Vance and the lab requisition for the blood test. The lab is just down the street. I'll also give you a pamphlet with some information about depression and coping strategies. And I want you to know that if you start to feel overwhelmed or have any thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to the crisis hotline. The number is 988. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks to discuss the blood test results and how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds fine. I'll try to remember. Thank you again, Doctor Auelua. I feel… a little better, just talking about it. Maybe things will get easier.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Vantine. I’m very glad. I’m hopeful that things will get easier. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’m going to have the nurse come in and give you some instructions about the blood test. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time and your kindness. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was my pleasure. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
