DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... nice to meet you too. Oh dear, what was I coming in for? Something about... the waterworks, I think. It keeps bothering me. It’s been happening on and off for... well, a good while now. I just can't seem to get rid of it. It's very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, "the waterworks"... that sounds like you're having some urinary issues. And you said it’s been going on for a good while. Can you tell me a little more specifically what's bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, it's... burning, mostly. When I... go. And sometimes I feel like I have to go right away, even when I just went. It's a very unpleasant feeling, Doctor. I’m not sure how long exactly it’s been happening... months, I suppose? Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. And burning with urination, and a sense of urgency even after going... that gives us a few things to consider. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh my. I… I don’t think so. It’s hard to say, Doctor. I don't check... closely, if you understand. And pain… sometimes my back aches, but I’m an old woman. Everything aches, you know? It’s probably just my age. I don’t know if it’s related to this… water trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand. Back pain is common, certainly. But it’s good to ask. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Fever... Oh, goodness. I haven’t taken my temperature in… well, I don’t remember the last time. No chills, no. And no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Just this… discomfort. It's mostly just… annoying, really. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine – like the color, or if it smells different than usual?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. It looks… yellow, I suppose. Normal yellow? I really don’t pay much attention. And smell… no, I haven’t noticed anything different about the smell. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for sniffing my... you know. It’s just… a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking things I really can't recall. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, but I don’t remember what they said. I think… something about my pressure being a little high once? And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But nothing… serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries... let me think. Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out… a long, long time ago. And… and… I believe I had a hysterectomy. Yes, that’s right. Many years ago, when I was younger. That’s all I can recall, Doctor. Everything is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. Good to know. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications... well, I take a little something for my bones, the doctor prescribed it. It's... a little white pill, I think. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter things… the kind you get at the drugstore. But that's about it, Doctor. I don’t like taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. I used to be able to eat shellfish, but I haven’t had that in years. Not because of allergies, just… didn’t care for it much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh my. Well, I’m retired, so I don’t do much working anymore. I live alone. I enjoy… sitting, mostly. And watching television. I don’t get out much these days. I used to travel with my husband, but… that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in… well, decades. Not my cup of tea at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. I think I have enough information for now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We’ll just check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to do a quick urine test. That will help us narrow down what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A test sounds… sensible. I suppose. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. I’d like to be done as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. A quick exam will be just fine.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I'll be as quick as possible. Let's start by having you lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Very well. I’m not very flexible these days, Doctor. Do try to be gentle. I don't want to pull anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Breathing deeply… and slowly… Alright. Your abdomen is soft, no obvious tenderness to the touch. I do hear normal bowel sounds. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll leave you some privacy. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the cup, and finish. Do you have any trouble with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A sample. Mid-stream... I think I remember what that means, but I haven't had to do that in years. I hope I can manage. I have a bit of trouble sometimes… controlling things, you know? But I’ll try my best. Just… give me a moment, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time, Ms. Wease. I’ll be just outside if you need anything. Let me know when you're finished.
PATIENT: I'll… be right back, Doctor. This is rather embarrassing, you know. But I suppose it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Take your time. I understand.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. It took a bit, but I managed. I do apologize for the delay.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Ms. Wease. You took your time, and that's perfectly alright. I'll send this off to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you’ve told me, and with the possibility of a urinary tract infection, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Alright. If that will help… yes, that sounds sensible. Finish the whole course, you say? Oh dear, I always forget things. Perhaps I should write that down. Yes, a note is a good idea. Just give me a moment. Do you have a pen, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. And I'll also write it down for you. The prescription is for Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day for seven days. And I also want you to drink plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Nitrofurantoin… twice a day for seven days. Drink plenty of water, avoid caffeine… Yes, I think I can manage that. But… what if I do forget? Is there anything I can do to help me remember? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Wease. Setting an alarm on your phone might be helpful, or you could leave yourself a note somewhere you’ll see it often – like on the refrigerator. You could also ask a friend or family member to remind you. And if you’re still having trouble remembering, don’t hesitate to call the office, and we can work something out. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: An alarm... a note... perhaps my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, could remind me. She’s very kind. Yes, that's a good idea. I think that will do. No, Doctor, I don't think there's anything else. I just want to get rid of this… bother. Thank you for your help. I believe that’s all. I’m ready to go, if you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. I hope the antibiotics help resolve your symptoms quickly. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week to see how you're doing. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A follow-up… yes, that sounds sensible. A week from today? Yes, that should be fine. Just… remind me the day before, please? I don’t want to forget. I do appreciate your help, Doctor. You’ve been very patient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I'll make a note to have the office call you to remind you of your appointment. I’m glad I could help. Here's a copy of your discharge instructions and the prescription. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a good day, Ms. Wease. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. .
