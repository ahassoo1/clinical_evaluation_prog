DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Fourney. Well, lately I been feelin'… thirsty. Real thirsty. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't seem right.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. More than usual. I always drink water, you know, live in the islands, gotta stay hydrated. But this is… different. Like I could drink a whole bucket and still feel dry in my mouth. And I eat, a good portion, but then a little while later, I feel like I need to eat again. It worryin’ me a bit.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It start… maybe a month ago? A little over a month, I would say. At first, I thought it was just the heat, you know? But the heat break a little, and I still feel this way. It gettin' worse, if that make sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I been goin' to the bathroom more often. To pee, you know? Especially at night. Wakin’ me up sometimes. I thought maybe I drinkin’ too much water because I thirsty, but… maybe it somethin’ else? I also feel a little tired, but I does work hard at the pump station, so I figure that's just from the work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of… diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side… I think she had somethin’ like that. She was always complainin’ of bein’ tired and thirsty, and she had to watch what she eat. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the doctor sayin' for sure. My mother was fine, I think. Never heard nothin’ about it with her. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not really. Everything look the same to me. I don't wear glasses, you see, and I can still read the newspaper just fine. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always figured that was just my age. I does need new glasses, maybe. But nothin’ drastic, no. Everything still clear enough, if that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? No, Doctor, nothin' like that. My hands get tired from workin’ the pump, of course. And my feet ache sometimes, but that’s just from standin' all day. Not numb, though. I can feel everything, thank goodness. I need my hands and feet for my work, you see. Wouldn’t be able to do it if I couldn’t feel them!
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Zicarelli, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work. Just to rule things out. It could be a number of things, but given your symptoms and family history, we need to check your blood sugar levels. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor, not that I know of. I never had a problem with any medicine before. And latex… hmm. I think I used a glove once or twice at the pump station, and I didn’t have no reaction. I does get mosquito bites, if that counts! But not an allergy, no. Is the blood work going to hurt bad? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: It's just a small prick, Ms. Zicarelli. A little discomfort, that's all. Now, let’s get started. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then we’ll do the blood draw. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A little prick, you say? I suppose I can manage that. I been through worse at the pump station, you know! Yes, yes, I can step on the scale. Just let me know if it too heavy! I does enjoy my food, you see.
DOCTOR: 78 kilograms. Okay. And your height is listed as 1.68 meters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. 1.68. That’s me. I haven’t grown any taller lately, I assure you! But thank you for checkin'. It’s good to be sure. What do we do next? This heart listenin’ sound a bit scary? I hope it nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Okay. Heart sounds are a little rapid, but regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A bit elevated, but not drastically. Now, I'm going to check your feet. Please take off your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breaths, you say? I can do that. 140 over 90, you say? What does that mean? Is that bad? Oh, alright, shoes and socks off. Here you go. They ain't pretty, from all the work, you know. But they get me where I need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. Feeling any numbness or tingling here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin' like that. A little achin' sometimes, especially at the end of the day, but no numbness or tingly feelin'. I can feel everything just fine. See? Everything workin' like it should. It's just hard work, you know. Always on my feet. What are you lookin' for, Doctor? Is somethin' wrong? I worry easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Zicarelli, based on your symptoms, your family history, and the initial exam, I want to run some blood tests, including a fasting blood sugar and a comprehensive metabolic panel. It's important to rule out diabetes. We’ll also check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance? No, Doctor. No insurance. Never had it, and I can't afford it, to be honest. My husband works hard, but it just barely covers the bills, you know? How much will the tests cost? Can I pay it off a little at a time? I really need to know what's wrong with me, and I don't want to delay gettin' it checked just because of the money. I’m a hard worker, I can pay somethin' every month, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. The tests will be around $200. We do have a payment plan available, $50 a month until it's paid off. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now. Afterwards, we’ll discuss the results when they come back in a few days. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: $200… $50 a month, I can manage that. Yes, that’ll work. Thank you, Doctor, thank you for helpin' me out. No, I don't think I have any more questions right now. Just… when will I get the results? And what if it is… what if it’s that diabetes? What happens then? I’m a bit scared, to be honest. But let's just get the blood drawn, you're right. Let's find out. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll draw the blood. It will take about 10-15 minutes. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. If it is diabetes, it’s manageable with diet, exercise, and potentially medication. We’ll discuss all options thoroughly when we have the results. Don’t worry too much until we know for sure. Go ahead, and let’s get that blood drawn. It's just a precaution.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just a precaution, you say? Room 203, right. I'll go down there now. Thank you again for your help, and for the payment plan. I appreciate it very much. I hope it nothin' too serious…
