DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot... it’s been bothering me. A sore, you see. A bad one. It won’t go away. It’s on my foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing. I understand. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it started small, maybe a little cut. I don’t remember exactly how it happened. Old age, you know? Then it just… got bigger. And red. And now… it hurts to walk. A lot. It's on the top of my foot, I think. Hard to see without a mirror.
DOCTOR: Right, a small cut that’s grown larger and is now painful when you walk. That does sound concerning. And you said it's on the top of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. On top. Near my toes, I believe. It’s hard to say for sure. My wife… she used to help me look at it, but she’s… gone now. I try, but bending over is difficult these days.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Stoegbauer. That must be incredibly difficult. We'll definitely take a good look at it here, so you don’t have to strain. Let's start with a bit more detail about the sore itself. Has there been any drainage – any pus or fluid coming from it?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm… let me think. Yes, I think so. Sometimes… a little bit of… wetness. Not a lot. It makes my sock… damp. It’s not always there, though. Mostly when I’ve been walking. It’s… yellowish, maybe? I don’t know much about colors, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, some yellowish drainage, especially with walking. That's helpful to know. Has there been any change in the color of the skin around the sore?
PATIENT: Around the sore… Yes. It’s… red. More red than the sore itself, I think. And… the skin feels warm. Not hot, but… warmer than the rest of my foot. It's also a little swollen, I think. My ankle feels a bit bigger sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, redness, warmth, swelling, and yellowish drainage. That sounds like it could be an infection. I'm going to need to take a closer look at it to be sure. Would you mind if I examined your foot?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine, Doctor. Please do. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore here on the top of your foot. It's approximately two centimeters in diameter, and there is some redness and swelling extending around it. It is tender to the touch, and I do feel some warmth. Your pulses are present, which is good, but a little diminished. There’s some surrounding cellulitis. And yes, the area is quite tender. It does appear to be infected. I'm concerned about the possibility of it spreading. Do you have a fever or any chills?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t taken my temperature. I don’t usually get fevers. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m always a little tired. Old age, again. No chills, though. Definitely no chills. I sleep okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills. Given the redness, swelling, tenderness, and drainage, it sounds like you likely have a localized infection called cellulitis. It's important we treat this to prevent it from spreading further. Do you have any allergies to medications, especially antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… allergies… Let me see. My wife always handled the medications. I don’t think so. I don’t remember ever being allergic to anything. But… it’s been a long time. I really don’t know, Doctor. I've never had to take many pills. Just a little something for my blood pressure sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you take something for your blood pressure. That's good information. To be on the safe side, we'll start you on an oral antibiotic. I'm going to prescribe cephalexin 500mg twice a day for ten days. Alongside the antibiotic, it’s important to keep the area clean and covered. I recommend washing it gently with soap and water twice a day and keeping it covered with a clean, dry bandage. Elevate your foot as much as possible, and avoid putting too much weight on it. I'd like to see you back here in three to five days to check on your progress. If the redness or swelling gets worse, or if you develop a fever, chills, or increased pain, please come in immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright, Doctor. Cephalexin… twice a day… I can remember that. Keep it clean, bandage it, keep it up… I will try my best. Three to five days… I can do that. And if it gets worse… I’ll come right away. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm glad I could help. Just a couple more things. It's important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before the ten days are up. Stopping early can lead to the infection coming back. Also, be aware of any side effects from the medication. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. If you experience any severe side effects, like difficulty breathing or a rash, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I'm going to write out detailed instructions for you, including information about the medication and wound care. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Finish the pills, watch for bad feelings… I understand. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again. I appreciate your kindness. I think that’s all. I should probably get going, before I forget anything else!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. You take care now, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, remember to finish the entire course of antibiotics. Have a good day, and we'll see you back in a few days.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Have a good day.
