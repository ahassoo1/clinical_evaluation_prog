DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s about my waterworks, I guess you could say. I’m havin’ trouble… gettin’ it all out, when I gotta go. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Hilber. It takes courage to discuss these things. So, you’re experiencing difficulty with complete bladder emptying?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Complete… emptying. That’s a good way to put it. It feels like… like there's always a little bit left in there, even after I try. It doesn't hurt, not really. Just… frustrating, and a little worryin’. It’s been goin’ on for… oh, maybe a month or so now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so. And you said it's not painful, just frustrating and concerning. Has this been a gradual change, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: It was… slow, I think. I didn't notice at first. Just kinda… over time, I had to… try a little harder, you know? And then it got to where it just didn't feel like it all came out. My wife… she woulda noticed quicker, probably. But she’s… gone now. It’s just been me payin’ attention to these things.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Hilber. It’s understandable that things feel different now. It's good you're taking care of yourself, and that you noticed this change. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit more about your urinary stream?
PATIENT: My… stream? You mean when I’m actually goin’? It’s… not as strong as it used to be, I reckon. Not a powerful rush, like when I was younger. More… kinda dribbles out, sometimes. And I gotta… push a little, you know? Not a lot of pain, just… effort. It takes a little longer than it used to, gettin’ it goin’ and gettin’ it done. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explainin’ things like this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. You’re explaining it very well. A weaker stream, some dribbling, and the need to push to start and finish. Have you noticed any changes in how often you need to urinate, either during the day or at night?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been gettin’ up more at night. Maybe once, sometimes twice. Used to be I could sleep right through. And… I feel like I gotta go a little more often during the day too, even if it’s just a little bit. It’s not terrible, but it’s… more than usual, for sure. I try not to drink too much before bed, but… sometimes I just can’t help it. Old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased frequency, especially at night, and the need to get up more often. Let's talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, prostate problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… the doctor, back in Anchorage, he told me I had a little bit of high blood pressure a few years back. He gave me some pills for it. I took ‘em for a while, but… they made me feel kinda dizzy, so I stopped. He wasn’t too happy, but… I figured a little dizziness was better than feelin’ sick all the time. Other than that… I don't think so. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, you know? And… I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication briefly, and an appendectomy as a child. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like pain relievers or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not right now. I try to avoid pills if I can. I take a little fish oil sometimes, for my joints. My daughter sends it to me. But that’s about it. Mostly I just try to take it easy and stay warm. And drink a lot of tea. Does tea count as medicine?
DOCTOR: I wouldn't call tea medicine, Mr. Hilber, though it can certainly be comforting! Alright, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I used to go berry pickin’ with my wife all the time. She knew all the good spots. Never had an issue with any of the berries, or the plants, or nothin’. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Hilber. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as prostate cancer, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. Had to go to the hospital a few times. And my grandfather, on my mother’s side… he had somethin’ with his kidneys, I think. My wife’s family… they were pretty healthy, as far as I know. No real major illnesses. Mostly just… old age. They lived long lives, though. That's what mattered.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your father and some kidney issues in your wife’s grandfather. Thank you for sharing that. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, exactly?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Hilber. It simply means information about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife, she tried it once, when she was young and foolish. Didn't like it. And I don’t drink, either. Not really my thing. Never did get the taste for it. And… definitely no recreational drugs. Never touched ‘em. I like my tea, that’s about it. Keep it simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen and, if you're comfortable, performing a prostate exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. I suppose it's gotta be done if you think it’ll help. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… I can handle that. The… the other thing… the prostate exam… … Well, I’ve never had one of those before. But… if you think it’s important, go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will be as gentle as possible. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll take things slowly and stop if you’re uncomfortable at any time. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. Not drastically high, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, if you’re comfortable, we can proceed with the prostate exam. Would you like a moment to prepare?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A moment would be good. I… I reckon I’m a little nervous. Never had anyone… back there before. It just feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous. Take your time. I’ll give you a few minutes to prepare. I'll be right outside the door if you need anything. Please just let me know when you're ready, and we'll proceed at your pace.
