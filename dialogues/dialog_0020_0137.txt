DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place I want to live, for old people? They need me to come here, for… check. To make sure I can go there. It is a nice place, I think. My husband, he find it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a check-up to make sure you’re able to move into a new assisted living facility. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll get everything sorted out. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… lately? Not much. Old, you know? Sometimes my knee, it hurts. When I walk too much. And… I forget things sometimes. Not big things, just… where I put my glasses, or what I eat for lunch. Normal, yes? My husband, he says so.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Abdollahi. It's common for things like that to happen as we get older. The knee pain and occasional forgetfulness... We’ll take a look at both. When you say your knee hurts, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache. Not sharp. More when I go up stairs. Or walk a long way. Like… if I walk too much at the market. Then I need to sit down. It is better when I rest. And if my husband rub it, it feels good. He is a good man.
DOCTOR: That sounds like typical wear-and-tear, Ms. Abdollahi. It's good your husband helps with the rubbing, that’s very kind of him. And it's helpful to know it’s better with rest. Now, about the forgetfulness… you mentioned it’s not big things. Can you give me an example of a time you’ve noticed it recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yesterday, I make coffee. Then I… I go to find the TV remote. But I forget why I go! I just stand there, looking. My husband, he laugh. He say, “You want to watch the news!” And then I remember. Little things, you know? Not scary. Just… silly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds… typical. It's good you're aware of it, and that your husband is there to help. We'll want to do a little bit of a check-up, just to make sure everything is as it should be. I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health, then we can do a quick physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Ask me anything. I try to remember! And if I forget, you just ask again. No problem. My husband is good at remembering for me too, if I need.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi. We’ll take our time. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High… high what? Oh! My husband, he has high blood pressure. I do not, I think. The doctor, he check me every year. He say I am okay. Arthritis… no. My mother, she has bad arthritis in her hands. But me, I am okay. Just… old knees. And sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no high blood pressure or diabetes, that's good. You’ve mentioned the knee pain and occasional dizziness. We'll check that out. And no history of arthritis, just some family history on your mother’s side. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. When I was young, I have my tonsils out. That is all, I think. Very long time ago. And… I have a little cut on my arm when I was a little girl. But that is not a surgery. My husband, he has a surgery on his back, but that is him, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out when you were young, and no other surgeries. Good to know. Now, can you tell me about any medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… Just one. For my water pills. The doctor, he give it to me for the swelling in my feet. Sometimes, they swell up. Especially when it is hot. That is all. Just one little white pill, every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, just one medication for the swelling in your feet. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I eat everything. My husband, he is allergic to cats. But I like cats! No allergies for me. Just… I do not like very spicy food. That is not an allergy, just… I do not like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of any major illnesses in your family – like heart disease, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he has a bad heart. He die when he was young. And my mother, she has… how you say… the memory problems, when she gets old. Not so bad, but… she forgets things. Like where she put her things. And my sister, she has cancer, but she is okay now. She get treatment. That is all I remember. It is a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease with your father, some memory problems with your mother, and cancer with your sister. Thank you for sharing that information. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm. I like to cook. I make good tortillas! And I like to sit with my husband and watch the news. Sometimes we go to the market. Not too much walking, because of my knee. I used to dance, but… not anymore. Old now, you know? I try to stay busy. And I pray every day. That is my lifestyle. Simple.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Abdollahi. It's good to stay active and connected. Alright, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Check everything. I trust you. Let's do it. I hope my knee is not too bad! It is sometimes a little sore. But I can walk. Slowly, you know?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. It’s good you can still walk; that's a positive sign. Okay, your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s a little elevated, but not too concerning. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I lie down. My knees… they are not pretty. Old lady knees, you know? Sometimes they crack when I move. And they feel a little stiff in the morning. But I can bend them, see?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some mild swelling around both knees, and a bit of crepitus - that's the cracking sound you mentioned - which is common with aging. Your range of motion is good, but you do seem to have some tenderness when I press here, on the inside of your knee. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good. Everything else seems to be within normal limits. Overall, your exam is reassuring. The main concern is the mild swelling and tenderness in your knees.
PATIENT: Good. I am glad it is not too bad. What does that mean, Doctor? Do I need a special cream? Or maybe a pill? I just want to be sure I can go to the nice place, you know? My husband says it will be very good for me. And I want to cook for him there!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Abdollahi. The swelling and tenderness suggest some mild arthritis in your knees, which is very common at your age. It's likely contributing to the pain and stiffness you’re experiencing. A special cream might offer some temporary relief, but it won’t address the underlying cause. A pill could help with the pain, but we need to consider the potential side effects. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out other conditions. I also recommend getting an X-ray of your knees to see the extent of the arthritis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… yes, okay. Blood tests too. If that helps. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to be sure. My husband, he worries too, you know? He wants me to be happy. And I want to be able to walk to the kitchen! To make tortillas for him. Is the X-ray… does it hurt? I do not like needles. And I do not like being still for too long.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s good you’re thinking about your husband and wanting to stay active. The X-ray is completely painless. It's just a quick scan, like a photograph of your bones. You’ll need to lie still for a few minutes, but it’s not a long time. And the blood tests will only require a small sample of blood – just a little prick. We’ll get it over with as quickly as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. It may involve some simple exercises, physical therapy, or medication if needed. We'll make sure you're comfortable and able to continue doing the things you enjoy. In the meantime, are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or redness around your knees?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. My knees are just sore, and sometimes they feel a little stiff. No redness. Just… old knees. That is all. I am glad you are listening to me. Sometimes doctors do not listen to old ladies! But you are very kind. And you make me feel better.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Abdollahi. It's very important to me that my patients feel comfortable and heard. And you're absolutely right, it's vital to listen to everything you tell me. Okay, so to summarize, we’ll order some blood tests and an X-ray of your knees. I’ll also have my nurse draw up a referral for physical therapy, just in case. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You explained everything very well. Thank you for being so kind. And thank you for listening to me about my tortillas! It is important to me. My husband loves them. He says I make the best tortillas in the world! Now… how long will the tests take? And when can I see you again? I hope it is not too long. I want to go to the nice place soon!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. And I’m glad to hear about your tortillas! That’s wonderful. The blood tests and X-ray should take about a week to come back. Once we have the results, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I’m hoping we can get you in within a week or two, depending on my availability. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as severe pain, swelling, redness, or fever, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any concerns about getting the tests done?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can go get the tests. My husband, he can drive me. He always drives me. He is a good man. And I am not scared. I just want to be healthy, so I can go to the nice place and make tortillas for him. And I want to be able to walk to the market with him. That is all. Thank you again, Doctor. You made me feel much better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was a pleasure meeting you. It sounds like you have a wonderful husband, and it's great that you have goals you're working towards. My nurse will come in shortly to go over the instructions for the blood tests and X-ray. She’ll also give you a copy of your results once they’re available. Have a wonderful day, Ms. Abdollahi, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, enjoy making those tortillas!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor! You too.
