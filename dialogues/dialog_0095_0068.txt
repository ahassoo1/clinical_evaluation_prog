DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… the swelling. After the cancer treatment, you see? It’s my leg, mostly. It gets… big. Not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your leg after cancer treatment. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? After I finished all the… the stuff they did. It wasn’t much at first, just a little puffiness. Now it’s… well, you can see! It’s hard to get my shoes on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly on your leg is the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly my right leg. The ankle and… up to my calf, I think. Not my thigh, mostly down low. It feels… tight, too. Like a balloon. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Tight like a balloon. Okay. Has the swelling been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… worse some days. Like, if I stand a lot. Or if it’s hot. Then it really puffs up! But even when I rest, it doesn't go completely away. It’s always… a little bit there now. I don’t know if that’s normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with standing and heat, but doesn't fully resolve with rest. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, exactly. More like… heavy. And achy, sometimes. Especially at night. It's not a sharp pain, if that makes sense. Just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy and achy, worse at night. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your right leg?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me see… It’s a little redder, maybe? Not bright red, just… not the same color as my other leg. And… it feels warm to the touch, I think. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, redness and warmth. I’m going to do a quick exam of your legs, if that’s alright. It will just involve feeling and looking at them, and maybe checking your pulses. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. This cancer… it worries me, even after the treatment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Queener. I do see some swelling on your right leg, as you described, and it is warmer to the touch. I’m feeling some pitting edema here – that’s when I press on the skin and it leaves a little indentation for a few seconds. Your pulses feel good and are the same on both sides, which is reassuring. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly as well, just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good, I guess. Pitting… what was that again? You said something about… indentation? Is that bad? I don't understand all the doctor words.
DOCTOR: Pitting edema just means that when I press on your skin, it leaves a little dip for a little while. It’s a sign of fluid buildup. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your cancer treatment. What type of cancer did you have, and what treatments did you receive?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it was… breast cancer. A few years ago now. I had… the surgery, of course. And then… radiation. And the… the pills. Lots of pills. I don't remember the names, I’m sorry. They made me tired. Very tired. It was all a blur, to be honest. Is the swelling… because of that?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember the names of the medications. Many people find it difficult to keep track. It’s definitely possible that the swelling is related to the cancer treatment. Radiation and some cancer medications can sometimes cause fluid buildup, a condition called lymphedema. However, we need to rule out other potential causes as well. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh… I don't think so. I've never been told I have them. I had a DVT once, years ago, in my calf, but they treated it with… blood thinners, I think. That was before the cancer, though. A long time ago. Does that matter? I don't really remember much about that either, to be honest. It was… scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a DVT is important to know. It does increase your risk. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a D-dimer blood test to see if there’s any sign of a current blood clot. And then, an ultrasound of your leg to visualize the veins and check for any blockages. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this swelling to go away. It’s… uncomfortable, and it worries me. Ultrasound… that’s the one with the… the gel? Is it painful? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one with the gel. It’s not painful at all, Ms. Queener. It's completely painless – just a little cool gel on your leg and a probe that sends out sound waves. And the D-dimer is just a simple blood draw. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your right leg whenever possible, especially when you're resting. And I’d also suggest wearing compression stockings to help reduce the swelling. I can write you a prescription for those. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… okay. Yes, that sounds… helpful. Elevating… I try to, but it’s hard. I sit a lot, you see. It's just… easier. But I’ll try harder. A prescription… yes, please. I don’t want this to get worse. When will we know the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you the prescription for the compression stockings now. The lab results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if the swelling gets significantly worse, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve taken lots of pills, as I said. Never had a reaction, to my knowledge. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's just my skin. It’s always been like that. I don’t think I'm allergic to anything, but I could be wrong. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or watching out for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Besides elevating your leg and wearing compression stockings, it's important to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids. And avoid standing for long periods if you can. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about lymphedema and some exercises you can do to help improve circulation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Lymphedema… okay. I’ll take the handout. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well. I just hope it’s not serious. And I hope these stockings help. I think that’s all. Thank you for seeing me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener. You’re very welcome. We’ll get those tests done and figure out what’s going on. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if you experience any sudden changes in your leg, go to the emergency room. Here’s the handout, and I’ll get the prescription sent to your pharmacy. Have a good day.
