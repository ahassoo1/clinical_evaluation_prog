DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Todoroivich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's just… I’ve been itching. Everywhere, really. It started a couple weeks ago, maybe a little longer. Not constantly, but enough to be really annoying. It's just… generalized, I guess. Hard to describe, but it feels like under the skin sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. "Generalized" itching… and you say it feels under the skin sometimes. Okay. And is it just the itching, or are you seeing any rash, bumps, redness… anything visible at all?
PATIENT: No, that's the weird thing. Nothing visible. That's why I waited a bit before coming in, honestly. Figured it would go away on its own, or I was just imagining it. But it hasn't, and it’s getting… well, it’s just bothersome. No bumps, no redness, nothing like that. Just… itchiness. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Especially at night.
DOCTOR: Right. Itching without a rash… that narrows things down, but doesn't make it easy. And worse at night, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely worse at night. When I’m trying to sleep. It makes it hard to get comfortable, and then I just… scratch. I don't even notice half the time until afterwards. It’s… not great. I’m a bit worried, to be honest. I haven't had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we need to rule some things out. Have you changed any laundry detergents, soaps, lotions recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been using the same stuff for… oh, goodness, years, probably. I’m not one for changing things up. Same laundry detergent, same body wash, same… everything. My wife… well, she used to make sure we always had the same things. It’s… a habit, I guess. So, no, nothing new there.
DOCTOR: Right. And any new foods in your diet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mostly cook for myself these days. Simple things, you know? Chicken, vegetables, potatoes… nothing fancy. I'm not a big eater, never have been. I certainly haven’t tried anything new that I can think of. Honestly, I probably eat too little more than too much. Is that… is that helpful information? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: It's… good to know. Alright. We’ll need to do a quick exam, just to be thorough. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin more closely, despite you saying there’s nothing visible. It’s standard procedure. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Standard procedure makes sense. Let me just… carefully. My joints aren’t what they used to be. There. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart and lungs sound clear. Lymph nodes are… unremarkable. Skin is, as you said, without any visible rash or lesions. However, I do notice some very subtle dryness. It’s barely perceptible, honestly, but it’s there. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife… she always said I was lucky that way. Nothing I've ever eaten or touched has bothered me. That is, nothing I can remember. Is that helpful? Honestly, I've always been pretty healthy. It’s just… this itching is new. Really new.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your history – or lack thereof – and the examination findings… it could be a mild case of xerosis, or dry skin. It often causes itching, particularly at night. However, it's unusual to present without visible signs of dryness. We also need to consider other possibilities, even if they’re less likely. Have you been particularly stressed lately?
PATIENT: Stressed? Hmm… I suppose so. Being alone… it’s been tough, you know? My wife passed away two years ago. Still… still miss her terribly. So, yeah, I’d say I’m a bit stressed. Not… outwardly, maybe. I keep to myself mostly. But inside… it's hard. I try not to dwell on it, but… it’s always there. Is that… is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Stress can exacerbate skin conditions, yes. It’s not uncommon. However, given your age and the lack of any other symptoms… I suspect we’re dealing with a relatively minor issue. I’m going to recommend a course of emollient therapy – a good, fragrance-free moisturizer – applied liberally several times a day. If that doesn’t provide relief within a week, we may need to consider further investigation, but let’s start with that.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. A moisturizer. I can do that. I always used to let my wife handle those things. She knew all the best lotions and creams. But… I can manage. Fragrance-free, you said? Just to be sure. I don’t want to make things worse. And where would I get this… emollient therapy?
DOCTOR: Yes, fragrance-free. Any drugstore will have several options. Look for something with ceramides or hyaluronic acid. Those are good ingredients. I’m going to print out a care sheet with some recommendations. If the itching persists after two weeks despite diligent use of the moisturizer, then we’ll discuss a referral to a dermatologist. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, and often, these things resolve on their own. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. Got it. Two weeks. I can certainly try that. Thank you, Doctor. That… that’s helpful. No, I don’t think so. Just… try the lotion. And wait. Thank you again. I appreciate your time. I guess that’s it then?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. Follow the instructions on the sheet, and if you're not seeing improvement in two weeks, call the office to schedule a follow-up. Have a good day, Mr. Ferneding. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day as well.
