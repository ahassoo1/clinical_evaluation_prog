DOCTOR: Hi Alese, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Let me see… well, it’s my tummy, really. It’s been giving me quite the trouble, on and off. Severe pain, lower down. It’s…difficult to explain precisely when it started, truthfully. Things aren’t always so clear in my mind these days. But it’s been happening more frequently lately, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy trouble” – we can definitely sort that out. And it's perfectly alright if the timing isn’t precise, we’ll get there. More frequent lately, you said. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s not a constant ache, you understand. It comes in waves, almost. And it’s… a deep ache, a cramping sort of feeling. It feels like… well, like everything is being squeezed, very tightly. It takes my breath away sometimes, honestly. And it’s usually… low down, right here. <gestures vaguely towards lower abdomen> It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, though. Everything feels a bit…fuzzy, you see. Do you… understand? I apologize for being so imprecise.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Alese. “Fuzzy” is a very good way to put it, and it’s not uncommon at all. Waves of deep, cramping pain low in your abdomen, taking your breath away… That gives me a good starting point. Does anything seem to trigger these waves of pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult question. I don't know if anything specifically triggers it. Sometimes it seems to come after I’ve been… moving about a bit more than usual, perhaps? But other times it just… happens. I haven’t noticed any particular foods or activities that make it worse, or better, for that matter. It’s…rather unpredictable, I’m afraid. I do try to be mindful, but… well, my memory isn't what it once was. <chuckles softly> Perhaps it is something I’m doing and simply forgetting?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, we'll figure it out together. No need to worry about forgetting, that's what we’re here for. So, it seems to happen somewhat randomly, possibly with more activity. And when it happens, how long does the pain typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, that varies as well. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes, a sharp cramp that fades quickly. Other times… well, other times it lasts for hours. It’s quite exhausting, honestly. When it’s bad, it keeps me up at night, and I find it difficult to concentrate during the day. It’s… a draining sort of pain. I usually just try to rest and take some… something I have at home, but it doesn’t always help. Do you… understand what I mean by “draining?” It's… hard to explain. It isn't just the physical discomfort, it’s… everything.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Alese. “Draining” is a perfect way to describe it. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your life, and we need to get to the bottom of it. Just to clarify, you mentioned “something you have at home.” Can you tell me what that is, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… a pill. A small, white pill. I believe the doctor… a previous doctor, I think… prescribed it for the… the lupus, perhaps? It’s supposed to help with the inflammation, I believe. I've been taking it on and off for… well, for a long time now. I can't quite recall the name of it, I’m afraid. It’s… frustrating, this memory. It’s… oh dear. I really should write these things down, shouldn't I? Perhaps I do need someone to help me keep track of things. <sighs softly> Do you… understand? It's a small, white pill, for the lupus, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Alese. It’s perfectly alright. We can definitely look up your medication history. Lupus can certainly cause abdominal pain, and it’s good you’re already taking something for it. Just to be thorough, do you experience any other symptoms alongside this abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… well, sometimes I feel rather tired, very tired indeed. More so than usual, even for me. And… occasionally, I get a bit of a rash, a small one, on my cheeks, I think. It comes and goes, rather quickly. And… <pauses, thinking> sometimes my joints ache, a little bit, my hands and wrists mostly. But that happens fairly often, to be honest. It’s… difficult to say what’s connected to the tummy pain, and what’s just… the usual, you understand? It all blends together a bit, I’m afraid. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Alese. Very helpful. Fatigue, a rash on your cheeks, and joint aches – those can all be related to lupus, and it's good we’re keeping them in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your other medical history. You mentioned lupus – are there any other conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. <pauses, tapping fingers gently on lap> I believe… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, a few years ago. It was quite high, I think. And… <frowns slightly> I had some surgery on my… on my hip, a long time ago. A very long time ago. And… I think I had some issues with my… my heart, a little bit, but it was a long time ago, and they fixed it, I believe. It’s all a bit… hazy, you understand? Things fade with time. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is there a way to… to find out these things, perhaps? A record somewhere? I truly don’t recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alese. That's what electronic health records are for! We can access your history right here. <gestures to computer screen> Let me pull up your chart… Okay, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension – high blood pressure – and you had a total hip replacement in 2008. And it confirms you had a cardiac ablation procedure in 2012 for atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… yes, that sounds… correct. The hip, definitely. And the… the heart, yes. That feels… relieved, actually, to have it confirmed. It’s good to know I’m not… imagining things. The atrial… the what did you call it? It sounds frightening. But yes, that’s right. It’s…good. It's good to have someone… keeping track of these things. <smiles faintly> Thank you. It’s been… a long time, and my memory isn't what it used to be. Are you going to ask me about… about other things now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. It's my job to help keep things straight. And yes, let's just get a full picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don’t believe so. I haven’t knowingly had any allergic reactions, ever, to my recollection. I used to be quite careful about what I ate, you see. But… I suppose it’s possible. It's just that nothing comes to mind immediately. I've never had a rash or difficulty breathing or anything like that after taking a medication or eating something. But… <pauses, thinking> I did have a bit of a reaction to a bee sting when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. Does that count? It’s… difficult to recall everything, truthfully. I apologize for being so vague. Is there a way to… to check this, perhaps? A record of allergies, somewhere?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alese. We can certainly check your chart. <types on computer> Okay, it looks like there’s no documented allergy listed here. A bee sting reaction in childhood doesn't typically need to be listed unless it was a severe reaction. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the lupus medication you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me think… Besides the pill for the lupus… I take something for my blood pressure, a small, orange pill. I believe it’s every morning. And… <pauses, tapping fingers> Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, my doctor recommended it a few years ago. I believe it’s a small, yellow capsule. That's all, I believe. Just the lupus pill, the blood pressure pill, and the vitamin D. Do you… understand? It’s easy to forget, you see, with so many different things to keep track of. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful. Is it alright if we… if we proceed with the exam now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alese. You are not being unhelpful at all. You’re giving me lots of good information, and we’re getting a clear picture. Okay, so that's lupus medication, blood pressure medication, and vitamin D. Perfect. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I will… try to remain as still as possible. <smiles faintly> Though my joints do sometimes ache, as I mentioned. I apologize in advance if I flinch a little.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Alese. We’ll go slowly. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, which we know about from previous records, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Okay, I'm noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the right side. Not severe, but definitely present. And it seems to be a bit… guarded, meaning you're tensing up slightly when I press there. Is that where you typically feel the pain?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s… that’s exactly where it hurts. On the right side, lower down. And… yes, I do tense up, I believe. I hadn’t noticed myself doing that, but… yes, you’re right. It’s a… a deep ache, and it makes me… protective, I suppose. I tend to hold my breath when you press there. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, it’s… a dull ache, a cramping sensation. And… it seems to radiate a bit, sometimes. <pauses, thinking> It feels like… like something is… tight, there. Do you… understand? It’s hard to describe, truthfully. It’s just… uncomfortable. And… rather worrying, to be honest. Is it… something serious? I apologize for being so anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Alese. It’s good we’re getting a clearer picture. Tenderness in the right lower abdomen, radiating pain, and a feeling of tightness… Those symptoms could indicate a few different things. It could be something relatively minor, like a muscle strain or some digestive issues, but it’s also important to rule out anything more serious. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I think it would be best to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help us look for signs of infection or inflammation, and the CT scan will give us a more detailed look at your organs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a CT scan? <frowns slightly> That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? I’ve never had one before. I… I don’t know. Is it… painful? And what are you looking for, exactly? I… I worry about radiation, as well. I’ve heard things… I… I suppose if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment, Doctor. But… it does sound rather frightening. I… I’m not sure I understand why it’s necessary, truthfully. I… <pauses, takes a deep breath> I’m just… anxious, I suppose. Is there… is there another way to find out what’s wrong? Perhaps some other sort of test? I apologize for being so difficult. I just… I don’t like the sound of a CT scan.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel anxious, Alese. It's completely understandable. A CT scan is a very good way to visualize what's going on inside your abdomen, and it's not usually painful. You'll lie on a table, and a machine rotates around you to take images. It's like a very detailed X-ray. The main thing we’re looking for is any signs of inflammation, infection, or blockage. We want to rule out things like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or a bowel obstruction. We're also assessing your gallbladder and kidneys, given your overall symptoms. Regarding radiation, the amount of radiation from a single CT scan is relatively low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. However, I completely understand your concerns. We could start with an ultrasound of your abdomen, which doesn't use radiation. It’s not as detailed as a CT scan, but it can sometimes give us enough information to make a diagnosis, especially regarding your gallbladder. Would you prefer to start with an ultrasound?
PATIENT: Oh… an ultrasound? That… that sounds much better. No radiation, you say? And it focuses on my gallbladder? Yes, I believe I would prefer to start with an ultrasound. That would… put my mind at ease, a little bit. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor, but… I do worry about these things. I… <smiles faintly> I apologize for being so… high-strung. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. Everything feels a bit more… fragile. Yes, please, let’s start with the ultrasound. When… when can that be scheduled? And… will I need to do anything to prepare for it? I… I just want to get this sorted out, you see. And… I do appreciate your patience with me.
DOCTOR: You're not being high-strung at all, Alese. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests, and I'm happy to accommodate your preferences. An ultrasound is a great first step. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for it – just make sure your abdomen is exposed, and you'll lie on a table. It usually takes about 30 minutes. I'll also go ahead and order those blood work tests, just to have a more comprehensive picture. We can draw those today before you leave. Once we have the results from the ultrasound and blood work, we'll discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. Tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM for the ultrasound, and the blood work today before I leave. That… that gives me a little bit of peace of mind, knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. Thank you… thank you very much for your patience and understanding. You’ve… you’ve been very kind. I… I truly appreciate it. I… <pauses, smiles faintly> I believe I’m ready for the blood work now, if you’re ready. Though… <frowns slightly> I do tend to bruise easily, so… please be gentle, if you would. I apologize for being such a bother. But… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve… put my mind at ease, a little bit.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not a bother, Alese. I’m happy to help in any way I can. And I will certainly be gentle with the blood work. Let’s head to the lab, and we’ll get that taken care of. It will just be a few tubes of blood, and it shouldn’t take long. After that, we can discuss some general lifestyle recommendations while we wait for the ultrasound results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. Let’s go to the lab, then. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I… I truly appreciate your patience. I… <pauses, smiles faintly> I believe I’m ready when you are. Though… <frowns slightly> I do tend to faint sometimes, so… if you don’t mind… perhaps a chair nearby, just in case? I apologize for being such a worry. But… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve… put my mind at ease, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alese. Absolutely. We’ll have a chair right there, and I’ll be right beside you the whole time. We'll take it slow, and if you start to feel lightheaded at all, just let me know. Your comfort is my priority. Let's head this way. The nurses in the lab are wonderful, and they'll take excellent care of you. It will be over before you know it. And remember, just breathe deeply, and let me know if you're feeling uncomfortable at any point. .
