DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. My wife, she want… babies. We want babies, yes. But… old now, you know? I think… we need help to make babies. That is why we here, I think. It been a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you and your wife are having difficulty conceiving?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Difficulty. That is… good word. Many years… no baby. We try, but… nothing happen. She worry a lot. I worry too, but… I am old man. Maybe it is normal? I not sure. What does "conceiving" mean, exactly? Sorry, my English not so good sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Conceiving” means getting pregnant, Mr. Carlotta. It sounds like you've been trying for some time. And while age can be a factor, we’ll need to look at both of you to determine what's going on. Has your wife seen a doctor about this before?
PATIENT: Hmm… she see doctor… yes. Many years ago. I think… for check-up. But not… this problem, not trying for baby problem. Just… woman things, you know? I not remember the doctor’s name. She not like to talk about it with me. She say is private. I understand. Is okay. But… she said the doctor said everything was… fine then. Long time ago, though. Very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Me? I… I not see doctor much. Just… when something broken. Old man problems, you know? Hurt back, bad knee. Nothing… down there. Never trouble. I work with metal, plastic. Making small things. Need strong hands, good eyes. Not… baby making things. I think I good… healthy enough for work, but… maybe not baby making. Is that… what you want to know?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a complete picture, Mr. Carlotta. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Doctor say… long time ago… my water was a little… high. But he gave me small pills. I take pills for many years now. Is that… diabetes? I forget. And… sometimes my head hurt, when it cold. But that is old man thing, I think. My wife, she remembers more. She keeps the papers. I not good with papers.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll need to review your wife's medical records as well. And I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Scale is good. No problem. I am not heavy man, you know? I eat little food. My wife, she worry I not eat enough! But I am fine. Is this good? Is number good?
DOCTOR: The scale reads 210 pounds, Mr. Carlotta. That puts your Body Mass Index in the overweight category. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please sit here?
PATIENT: Overweight? Oh. That is… not good? I not run much, you know. Old man. Always sitting. Making small things. Metal, plastic. My wife, she say I need to walk more. She is always right, that wife. Blood pressure… you mean the thing around my arm? Yes, okay. Do it quickly, please. My arm gets tired easy.
DOCTOR: Just relax your arm, Mr. Carlotta. 148 over 92. That’s a bit elevated. And your pulse is 78, regular. Do you experience any dizziness or headaches frequently?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Old man thing, I think. And… headaches, when it cold. Like you said, yes. But… not so bad. I take small pills, you know? For everything. Maybe the pills… make me feel funny sometimes. I forget which pills do what. My wife knows. She keeps the papers, and she remembers everything. Is she here with you today?
DOCTOR: It's important to understand what medications you’re taking, Mr. Carlotta. We need to have a clear picture. Given your elevated blood pressure and weight, and the fact that you've been trying to conceive for a long time without success, I recommend we start with some blood tests to assess your overall health and hormone levels. I’ll also need your wife to come in for a separate appointment so we can evaluate her as well. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Blood tests… okay. I not like needles, but… if you say so. And my wife… she come. She want baby very much. Is good she come. She remembers everything, yes. She can tell you all the pills. Hormones… what is hormones? Is that… baby making thing? It okay if it is baby making thing. We want baby.
DOCTOR: Hormones are chemicals in your body that regulate various functions, including reproduction. The tests will give us a baseline understanding of what's happening. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. She’ll explain the process. Afterwards, we can schedule an appointment for your wife. And… Honestly, Mr. Carlotta, given your age and the length of time you’ve been trying, the chances of successful conception are… diminishing. I don’t want to raise your hopes unnecessarily. Take this to the nurse, please. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Diminishing…? Is that… no baby? After all this time…? Okay. I… I will tell the nurse. And we will… schedule appointment for wife. Thank you, Doctor. .
