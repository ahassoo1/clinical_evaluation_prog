DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. Name's Arbie Rowbottom. Look, it's… well, it’s my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. And a man notices things, especially when it comes to his own body. Been flying for sixty years, you learn to pay attention. Don’t need any surprises up there.
DOCTOR: I see. Blood in the stool is certainly something we should investigate, Mr. Rowbottom. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the blood a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was… red. Blood is red, usually. Not green, not purple. Unless something’s terribly wrong, which I doubt. Look, I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don't spend my time analyzing the shade of things. Was it bright red, dark red… honestly, it all looked the same to me. It was in my stool, and that's enough detail for you, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and appreciate your candor. The color can offer clues, but it’s not critical at this stage. Was the blood mixed throughout the stool, or was it coating the outside?
PATIENT: Coating, I think. Yes, coating. Definitely on the outside. Not… mixed in. Like a bit of… well, like a bit of raspberry jam, if you must know. Though not nearly as appealing, of course. And considerably less sweet. I do hope this isn’t going to take all day. I have a flight to plan, you know. Important people expect punctuality.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Rowbottom. That is helpful. And I assure you, I’ll do my best to be efficient. Has this happened before, or is this the first time you’ve noticed blood in your stool?
PATIENT: First time. Absolutely the first. I’ve had a strong constitution my whole life. Never much bothered by anything, really. Ate all sorts of things on layovers… questionable things, sometimes. Never a problem. This… this is new. And frankly, unwelcome. I don’t have time for these sorts of… ailments.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s good that this is a new development. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, I've been a little tired lately. But at my age, aren’t we always a little tired? And my stomach's been rumbling a bit more than usual, but I blame that new coffee they serve at the airport. Weak stuff, honestly. Doesn't have the kick it used to. No pain, no… nothing dramatic. Just a bit off, generally. Like a finely tuned engine running on low octane fuel.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That is helpful information. And I appreciate the analogy. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. A bit of high blood pressure years ago, the doctor said. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn't like the way they made me feel. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy. Always active, always flying. A strong body needs no coddling. I doubt any of that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Knowing about the high blood pressure, even if it's no longer being treated, is helpful. And the appendectomy is good to have on record. Have you had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just the appendix. And that was back when they used… well, never you mind how they did it back then. Point is, no other surgeries. I’ve always been careful. Avoid unnecessary poking and prodding. Doctors these days are too quick to cut. I prefer to rely on my own constitution. And a good dose of common sense.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? That’s a… complicated question. My mother… well, she lived a long life, but I don’t recall her ever being particularly healthy. Always complaining about something. My father was a sailor, strong as an ox, but he died young. A bit of a heart problem, I think. Nothing specific, just… faded away. And as for siblings… I don’t have any. Always preferred my own company, frankly. So, not much in the way of family medical history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rowbottom. It's helpful to have that information, even if it’s limited. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! A pilot doesn't smoke! Ruins the lungs, dulls the senses. Absolutely not. Never touched the stuff in my life. Always been very careful about what I put into my body. You need to be sharp up there, Doctor. No room for hazy thinking. Now, a good scotch… that’s a different matter entirely. But smoking? Never. A terrible habit.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Rowbottom. And I concur regarding the importance of clear thinking. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well… as I said, a good scotch. A nightcap after a long flight, perhaps. Or a small glass with dinner. Nothing excessive, mind you. A pilot needs to maintain a steady hand, a clear head. Never drunk, never hungover. Just a civilized indulgence. I wouldn’t say I drink, Doctor. I appreciate a good scotch. There’s a difference, you know. A considerable difference. Now, what are you getting at? Is my scotch somehow responsible for this… unfortunate incident? I highly doubt it. A fine single malt is good for the soul.
DOCTOR: I wasn't implying that your scotch is the cause, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm simply gathering information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: As I said before, I stopped taking those blood pressure pills years ago. Didn't like the way they made me feel. And no, I don't take anything else. Don't believe in coddling the body. Let it sort itself out. A strong constitution doesn't need propping up with pills and potions. Now, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a flight to plan, you know. Important people are expecting me. A man's time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, Mr. Rowbottom. Just a few more questions, then we'll proceed with a physical exam, if you're agreeable. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. Never had a problem. I eat everything. Travel the world, you try all sorts of things. Never been one to shy away from a new experience. Now, if you're suggesting I'm allergic to something, you're wasting my time. A man needs his strength, and a strong body can handle anything. Now, let's get on with this exam. I haven't got all day, you know. And I expect a thorough explanation of whatever you find. I'm a practical man, I need facts, not theories.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Rowbottom. I assure you I’ll be as thorough and efficient as possible. If you would be so kind as to lie down on the table, we'll begin with an abdominal exam. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam.
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Abdominal exam, you say? Very well. But don't poke too hard, Doctor. I’m not a sack of potatoes. And be quick about it. I have a schedule to maintain. And if you find anything… unusual… I expect a full explanation. Don’t treat me like a child, Doctor. I've seen more of the world than you've had hot dinners.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please relax as much as possible. I'm starting on your right side now. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little discomfort on the left side. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like a bruise, perhaps. And it feels… a bit bloated, actually. Not terribly uncomfortable, but noticeable. As if I’d eaten something… indigestible. Though I can’t recall anything particularly troublesome. Now, is that significant? Don’t tell me it’s something serious, Doctor. I have a flight to catch, remember? And important people are depending on me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That's helpful. I'm also listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope now. The bowel sounds are present, but a bit… sluggish. Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Lung sounds are clear. Based on the exam, there is some tenderness in your left lower quadrant and sluggish bowel sounds. The elevated heart rate could be related to discomfort or anxiety. Given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, it's important to investigate this further. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions, but it could be a number of things, ranging from a mild infection to something more serious. Do you have any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain when I urinate? Good heavens, no! Why would I have pain when I urinate? I'm a practical man, I take care of myself. I drink plenty of fluids, I'm not one to shy away from… well, never you mind. The point is, no pain when I urinate. And I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive, Doctor. I came to you with a simple problem – blood in my stool – and now you’re asking about my… bodily functions. Honestly. I expected a professional assessment, not an interrogation. Now, what are you suggesting? Is this something serious? And what do we do about it? I have a flight to catch, remember? A very important flight.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s standard procedure to rule out various possibilities when investigating blood in the stool, and urinary symptoms can sometimes be associated with gastrointestinal issues. Given your symptoms and age, I recommend we order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Specifically, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or anemia, a stool test to look for blood and infection, and a colonoscopy to visually examine the colon for any abnormalities. A colonoscopy is the most definitive way to determine the cause of the bleeding. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Good heavens, no! A colonoscopy? You want to… look inside my colon? Absolutely not. I have no intention of having a camera shoved up… well, you know. I’ve heard stories, Doctor. Terrible stories. Is there no other way? Can’t you just… give me some pills? Or a stronger drink? I’m a practical man, I don’t need poking and prodding. And frankly, the thought of it is… unsettling. What are the risks? And how long will I be… incapacitated? I have a schedule to maintain, you know. A very important schedule. I’m starting to think I should have just ignored the whole thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy is not the most pleasant procedure, but it’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of bleeding in the colon and rule out serious conditions like cancer. The risks are relatively low, but they can include bleeding, infection, and perforation of the colon. However, these complications are rare. The procedure is typically performed under sedation, so you’ll be comfortable and won’t feel any pain. You'll need someone to drive you home afterwards, and you may feel some bloating and cramping for a few hours. We can discuss alternative tests, such as a fecal immunochemical test to detect blood in the stool, but it’s not as accurate as a colonoscopy. If the FIT is positive, we would still need to proceed with a colonoscopy. Given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, I strongly recommend a colonoscopy. It’s the best way to ensure we don’t miss anything serious. If you are still hesitant, we can schedule a consultation with a gastroenterologist who can explain the procedure in more detail and address any concerns you may have. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… a gastroenterologist? Another doctor poking and prodding? This is becoming ridiculous. Look, Doctor, I’m a practical man, not a hypochondriac. I've lived a long life, flown countless miles, and faced far more daunting challenges than a bit of blood in my stool. I understand your concern, but frankly, I’m starting to think this is all a bit… overblown. But… …very well. A consultation with this… gastroenterologist. But I want a full explanation of everything. The risks, the benefits, the alternatives. And I want a guarantee that this won’t interfere with my schedule. I have commitments, Doctor. Important commitments. And I expect to be treated with respect. I'm not some… some fragile old man. Now, can you arrange this consultation? And when can I expect it to be? I need to know if I can still make my flight.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will do everything I can to accommodate your schedule. I'm able to schedule a consultation with Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected gastroenterologist, for tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. She’s located at the City General Hospital, which is about a 20-minute drive from here. This referral slip contains her contact information and the details of the appointment. She will discuss the risks and benefits of a colonoscopy, as well as alternative tests, and answer any questions you may have. I will also have the lab draw a complete blood count today to provide Dr. Vance with some preliminary information. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or a significant amount of bleeding, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that will be all for now. Tomorrow afternoon, you say? 2:00 PM? Very well. Just… make sure she understands I have a schedule to maintain. A very important schedule. And I expect to be treated with respect. I’m a practical man, Doctor, not some… some invalid. Thank you for your assistance. Although, frankly, I'm not entirely convinced this whole thing is necessary. But better safe than sorry, I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a flight to plan. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I assure you Dr. Vance is very accommodating. I will make a note in your chart regarding your schedule. Thank you for coming in today. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a safe flight. .
