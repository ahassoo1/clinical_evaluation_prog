DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good to see you too, I guess. Look, I gotta get this exam done. For the army. They want me to take it before… well, before they let me sign up. It's just a check-up, right? Nothing fancy? I don't have time for a whole lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. An enlistment physical. Standard procedure. Though, “nothing fancy” doesn’t usually mean we skip important parts. We need to make sure you’re… suitable. Let’s start with the basics. Have you had a general check-up recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Not really. I mean, I feel fine. Always have. Last time I saw a doctor… hmm… probably when my wife, Ingrid, had our little Lars. That was… fifteen years ago, maybe? Just to make sure she was okay, you know? I didn’t need nothin’. I still don’t. But the army insists on this, so here I am. Waste of a good afternoon, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Fifteen years is… a while. Well, we'll do our best to be efficient. Let's get a history down. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Nope. Not a one. I get a little cold now and then, like anyone, but nothing you’d write home about. Strong as an ox, I am. Always have been. Ingrid always says I work too hard, but a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do. I build engines, you know? Big, complicated things. Requires a bit of stamina. Never sick a day in my life, practically.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Now you’re just asking questions for the sake of it. No. Never had a surgery. I fix machines, I don’t need fixin’. I’ve broken a bone or two, workin’ with the metal, but they healed up just fine on their own. Ingrid taped ‘em up good. No fancy doctor visits for a little scrape.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history then. Anyone in your family – parents, siblings – have any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Serious conditions? Well, my father, he… he worked too hard, like I said. He had a bad back towards the end. But that was just from liftin’ things, I reckon. Nothing fancy. And my mother… she worried a lot. Probably gave herself a headache now and then. But you can't catch worry, can you? No one really died of anything, if that's what you mean. Just… old age, mostly. And Ingrid’s family… healthy Swedes, the lot of ‘em. Strong stock.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you serious? No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Ingrid would kill me. And it's bad for your lungs, isn't it? Can't be buildin' engines with bad lungs. Absolutely not. Waste of good air, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I’ll have a beer now and then. With dinner, sometimes. A proper Swedish lager, mind you. Nothing fancy. Just a couple to relax after a long day workin’ on those engines. Ingrid likes a glass of wine with hers, too. But we don’t get… rowdy. Not at all. It’s just a bit of unwindin’. Nothing to write home about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? You're really trying to find somethin' wrong with me, aren't you? No! Absolutely not. I don't need medications. I eat a good breakfast, work hard all day, and sleep like a log. That’s all a man needs. Ingrid tries to get me to take somethin' for my knees sometimes, now that I’m gettin’ a bit older, but I won't hear of it. Perfectly fine, I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. We’ve established you feel perfectly fine. However, for the army, and frankly, for your own well-being, we need to do a physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, check your reflexes... the usual. It’ll take a little while, but it’s necessary. Can we proceed with that now?
PATIENT: Look, I knew it. I knew it would come to this. All this fuss over nothin’. Fine. Do what you gotta do. But don’t expect me to be impressed. And if it takes all day, I’m holdin' you responsible. Just get it over with. Blood pressure, lungs... whatever. Just hurry up about it. I've got engines waitin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat and relax. And, Mr. Hartness, I need you to be honest with me. Any pains at all?
PATIENT: Pains? Well, sometimes my knees ache a bit. After a long day, you know? Bendin' and twistin' with those engines. It's nothin' a bit of rest doesn’t fix. Ingrid always says I push myself too hard. But it's not a pain, exactly. More like a… a reminder. Just old age creepin' in, I suppose. But it doesn't stop me. Doesn't slow me down none. Now, just get on with it. This is a waste of good time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your back?
PATIENT: My back? Well… Sometimes it gets a bit stiff. Especially after liftin’ somethin’ heavy. But I’ve always been able to work through it. Never needed nothin’ for it. Like I said, my father had a bad back, so maybe it’s just… hereditary. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone or nothin’. It’s just… tight. Ingrid rubs it with somethin’ smelly sometimes, makes it feel a little better. But it doesn’t stop me from workin’. I’ve got deadlines, you know?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. We'll need to monitor that. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath, and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: Elevated? What’s that mean? Is that bad? I told you I feel fine! Maybe it’s just because I was walkin’ up the stairs. This buildin’ is ancient, you know. And I was thinkin’ about those engines… always got deadlines loom’ over me. Are you sure that machine is workin’ right? Doesn't sound right...
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds… slightly wheezy. Not alarming, but it warrants further investigation. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? Good heavens, no! Never had nothin’ like that. I work with metal, not… not lungs! I mean, I get a bit of dust in ‘em sometimes, from the sandin’ and the grindin’. But that’s just a bit of grit. Ingrid always says I should wear a mask, but it gets in the way. I can breathe just fine! Always have. And I've got deadlines! Are you tellin’ me I can't join the army because of a bit of dust?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I’m not saying you can’t join the army. But we need to be thorough. Wheezing indicates some airway inflammation. It could be caused by a number of things - allergies, a previous respiratory infection, or even prolonged exposure to irritants like dust. We're going to need to do some tests to determine the cause. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. It'll measure how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how efficiently your lungs are working.
PATIENT: X-rays? Tests? Good grief, this is ridiculous! I told you I feel fine! I build engines, I don't need tests! What's the army gonna think? I tell 'em I'm perfectly healthy, I spend a whole afternoon gettin’ poked and prodded by machines, and then they decide I'm not good enough? Ingrid's gonna kill me. All this fuss over… over nothin’! Is there… is there any way we can just skip the tests? I’ve got deadlines, you know!
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. However, the army has specific medical requirements, and we have a responsibility to ensure you meet them. More importantly, we need to rule out any underlying conditions that could potentially impact your health and performance. I am not going to sign off on your physical without these tests. It’s not about whether I think you’re healthy. It’s about providing the army with accurate and comprehensive information. We need to be certain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do your tests. X-rays, puffin' into machines… whatever you need to do. But if this delays my enlistment, you're hearin' about it. And if I end up with some fancy diagnosis… it's on your head. I'm tellin' ya, I’ve been buildin’ engines for thirty years. Thirty years! This metal is stronger than me, but I ain't breakin’ down any time soon. But… ... just get it over with. What do I need to do? Where do I go? Just tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to refer you to the radiology department at St. Jude’s Hospital. They’re just down the street, 123 Main Street. You'll need to schedule a chest X-ray. Then, there's a pulmonary function test facility, Coastal Lung Care, at 456 Ocean Drive. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. Here’s the referral form with all the necessary information and phone numbers. Once you have the results, you’ll need to bring them back to me. I’ll review them, and then we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: St. Jude's… Coastal Lung Care… More places to wait around, more people pokin' and proddin'. Fine. I'll go. But don't expect me to be happy about it. …Wait a minute. Does this mean I have to pay for these tests? I'm not insured, you know! I thought the army covered this sort of thing…
DOCTOR: That’s… a complication. Unfortunately, as you’re not insured, you will be responsible for the cost of the tests. The radiology department and pulmonary function test facility both have financial assistance programs available; you'll need to inquire about them directly. I can write a note explaining the situation for the billing departments, and perhaps they can offer a discount. However, I cannot guarantee coverage. As for the army... ... sometimes they will cover the cost upfront, but that requires pre-authorization and a lot of paperwork. You'll need to contact your recruiter to discuss your options. Do you have their contact information?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… paperwork… pre-authorization… This is… this is ridiculous! I just want to serve my country, build things, and get on with my life! I shouldn’t have to jump through all these hoops, fill out a million forms, and pay a fortune just to prove I’m healthy enough! Ingrid is going to have a fit… She warned me about this. She said the army isn't what it used to be… I… I don't even know my recruiter's number. I just showed up to the office, filled out a form, and they told me to get this exam. This is a mess. A complete mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Look, I understand your frustration. It's a complicated system, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's try to get this sorted out. Give me a moment. Okay, I’ve found the contact information for the recruiting office. Here’s the number. Explain your situation to them; they should be able to guide you through the pre-authorization process. And I’ll write a note detailing your lack of insurance for the billing departments at both facilities. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: I… I suppose not. You’ve given me enough paperwork to fill a small building. Look, just… thank you. I guess. For… tryin'. It’s just a lot. A lot of hoops to jump through. And I really need to get back to work. Those engines aren't going to build themselves, you know? I’ll… I’ll call the recruiter. And I’ll try to schedule those tests. Just… don’t expect me to be happy about it. And… if I end up with some fancy diagnosis, are you sure you can't just… wave your magic doctor wand and make it go away? .
DOCTOR: "Magic doctor wand…" .
