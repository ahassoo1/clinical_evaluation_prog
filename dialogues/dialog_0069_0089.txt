DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh dear… what does bring me in… It’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It’s been… troublesome, lately. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I believe that’s why I’m here, but the specifics… are a little hazy. I do know it has something to do with… a condition I have. Lupus, I think? Or something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very common for things to be a little fuzzy sometimes. We can definitely sort through it together. So, you’re experiencing pain in your lower abdomen, and you suspect it might be related to a condition like Lupus?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Lupus… or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, I think the doctor told me once. It’s… an autoimmune thing, isn’t it? Anyway, the pain… it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, and other times it’s quite sharp. It's been worse recently, that’s why I decided to come in. I don't quite recall when it started being worse, exactly… but I do know it’s been interfering with my sleep. Do you… need me to be more specific? I'm afraid I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful to know, Ms. Glymph. Don’t worry about being precise; we'll get there. So, the pain is fluctuating – sometimes dull, sometimes sharp – and it’s been worsening recently, enough to disrupt your sleep. Could you tell me a little more about where exactly in your lower abdomen you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… mostly down here, I think. Lower and central. Not really on the sides, more… in the middle? It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. Sometimes it feels like it radiates… goes all over, but it starts here, I believe. It's definitely below my belly button. Does that make any sense? I do apologize for being so vague. I used to be much better at this sort of thing… when I was working on the engines, I had to be very precise about everything. But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You're doing great. Lower and central, below your belly button, sometimes radiating outwards… that gives me a good starting point. And it's understandable that things are a little different now than when you were working on engines! Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms that seem to be happening at the same time, or around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Oh! Well, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. And a bit… achy, all over. Not just in my abdomen. My joints, perhaps? It’s hard to say. I also seem to be… losing my appetite. I haven’t been eating as much as I normally do. And… oh dear. I’m afraid I’ve also been having some trouble with… bowel movements. Constipation, I believe the doctor called it. Is that important? I try to drink plenty of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I hope I’m not rambling… I really do apologize. It's just… difficult to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Ms. Glymph. It's very helpful to have all of this information. Fatigue, body aches, loss of appetite, and constipation… these are all important things to know. And yes, they can definitely be related. Now, do you recall if you've had a fever recently?
PATIENT: A fever… Hmm… I haven't taken my temperature, so I can't say for certain. I haven't felt particularly warm, but… I don’t always notice those things, you see. Sometimes I'm so preoccupied with other things. I might have felt a little… flushed, perhaps? But I attributed that to the heat. It’s been quite warm lately, hasn’t it? It's difficult to say definitively whether I've had a fever. Would it have been obvious? I mean, would I have known? I apologize. This is truly frustrating. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly understandable. We can check your temperature now if you'd like, and that would give us a better idea. Let's talk a little about your medical history. You mentioned Lupus – do you know when you were diagnosed with it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the diagnosis. It was… quite a long time ago, now. I believe it was… around 2008? Perhaps 2009? I was working on the Aurora at the time, stationed near Kepler-186f. I remember feeling terribly unwell, constantly fatigued, and experiencing joint pain. The ship’s doctor ran some tests, and that’s when they discovered it. It was… quite a shock, I must admit. I was still relatively young, and I’d always been so healthy. I’ve been under a doctor’s care ever since, of course. I’ve been taking… medication. Various medications, over the years. I'm afraid I don't recall the names of them all. It's all rather… blurry. Do you need to know what I'm currently taking? I can try to remember… if you like. It may take me a moment.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. Don't strain yourself. Knowing roughly when you were diagnosed is helpful. And yes, if you could try to recall your current medications, that would be very useful. Even a partial list is better than nothing. Take your time, and don't worry if you can't remember everything. We can also look it up in the system if you'd like. Do you have a preferred pharmacy we can check?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a wonderful idea! A preferred pharmacy… yes. I use… Stellaris Pharmacy. It's near my apartment complex, on Level 3. They’re very efficient, and they always have my medications in stock. Perhaps they can send you a list? That would be… tremendously helpful. I apologize, my mind is simply… not cooperating today. I used to have such a good memory. But that was… before. Before everything. I do recall taking… something for the pain. A strong pain reliever. And… something to suppress my immune system, to help with the Lupus. But the names… they escape me. I'm so sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps if I think really hard…
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Glymph. Let me see if I can pull up your medication list from Stellaris Pharmacy. Ah, here we are. It looks like you are currently taking Hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily, and Prednisone 10mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, that’s it! Hydroxychloroquine and Prednisone. Oh, thank goodness. You’ve saved me. I was beginning to feel quite… helpless. Thank you, Doctor Andraca. It's wonderful to have someone who can… piece things together. I do take them every day, as prescribed. I’ve been on those medications for… quite some time, now. Years, I believe. They help, mostly. But… I do still experience flare-ups, from time to time. And that’s what I’m experiencing now, I suspect. The pain… the fatigue… it all feels very familiar. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m afraid I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Glymph. It's helpful to know that you've been on these medications for a while and that you suspect this is a flare-up. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a basic neurological exam. It’ll help me get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. A physical exam. Of course. I suppose it’s necessary. I haven't had one in… well, it's been a while. I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, if I’m honest. But I understand it’s important. Please, feel free to take your time. And if I flinch, please don’t be alarmed. I just… have sensitive skin. And sometimes my joints ache. I apologize in advance if I’m not a very cooperative patient. I truly do appreciate your patience, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I understand it can be uncomfortable, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. And don’t worry about flinching – it’s perfectly normal, and I won’t be alarmed. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Just take some deep breaths for me, if you would. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… okay, so far. A little… pressure, of course. But nothing particularly alarming. Ooh, that’s a bit tender, right there. Yes, right around there. It’s not excruciatingly painful, but it’s… uncomfortable. It feels… like a dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. And it seems to radiate… outwards, a little bit. It's hard to describe. It's similar to the pain I've been experiencing, but… more localized. It feels… deeper, somehow. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague. I'm truly trying to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Localized tenderness in the left lower abdomen… that gives me more information. And it’s alright to be vague; we'll work through it together. Now, I’m just going to check your neurological reflexes. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll tap your knees with a small hammer. It shouldn’t be painful, but let me know if it is.
PATIENT: Very well. Neurological reflexes. I haven't had those checked in… a very long time. It feels… a little strange, to be honest. But not unpleasant. Ooh, that’s a little… sensitive. It's not excruciatingly painful, but it's… uncomfortable. My joints haven't been feeling particularly strong lately, you see. Perhaps that’s why. I apologize for being a difficult patient. I truly do appreciate your patience, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been very kind. Is this… normal? Is this what usually happens during a neurological exam? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly normal to be sensitive, and your questions are very welcome. It’s good that you like to know what’s going on. The slightly diminished reflexes are likely related to your Lupus and the medications you’re taking. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Overall, your vital signs are stable, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is tender in the left lower quadrant, and your reflexes are slightly diminished, which, as I mentioned, is likely related to your Lupus. Based on your symptoms, your medical history, and the physical exam, it does sound like you’re experiencing a Lupus flare-up. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, electrolytes, inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We’ll also check your ANA level and other autoimmune antibodies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. Blood tests. Of course. It’s good to rule things out. It’s always best to be thorough. I’m glad you’re being so… meticulous, Doctor Andraca. It gives me peace of mind. Yes, please, order the blood tests. I’ll cooperate with whatever is necessary. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… like to be prepared. And I worry, you see. It’s just… this Lupus… it’s always lurking in the background, isn’t it? But I trust your judgment, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been very kind and patient. I truly do appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s good that you’re proactive and want to be prepared. We’ll need you to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. The lab will give you specific instructions when you schedule your appointment. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue taking your Hydroxychloroquine and Prednisone as prescribed. You can also continue with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen for the pain, but avoid taking them for prolonged periods without checking with me first. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor Andraca. Fasting for 8 hours… continue taking my medications… over-the-counter pain relievers as needed… Yes, I can manage that. And you’ll call me when the results are available? That’s wonderful. Thank you, Doctor Andraca. You've put my mind at ease. I truly appreciate your kindness, patience, and thoroughness. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to address this flare-up. I believe that’s all for today. Thank you again for your help. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything further.
