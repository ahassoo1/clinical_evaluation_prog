DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. Well, it is difficult to explain. My… words, they do not come so easily now. It is like they are… hiding. I have trouble finding the right ones, you see. It is been happening for… some time, I think. Not always, but more and more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your speech and finding the right words. That can be concerning. “Some time” is a bit vague, Sherrell, can you tell me roughly when you first started noticing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… roughly when? That is… a good question. It was… after my wife, I believe. Yes, after Martha passed. It was not immediate, but… slowly. Perhaps six months? Or was it a year? It is difficult to say precisely. Everything feels… a bit blurred now, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to twelve months after your wife passed. That’s helpful. And has this difficulty with finding words been gradually worsening since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Yes, it started small. Just… forgetting a common word now and then. But it is… more frequent now. And sometimes… sometimes the word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot reach it. It is… frustrating. It does not happen every day, no. But when it does, it is… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s intermittent but increasing in frequency. Besides the difficulty finding words, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking, memory, or speech?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. My memory… it is not what it once was, certainly. I forget appointments sometimes, and… names. But I always thought that was just… getting older, you see? And… no, not really with the speech itself, just… finding the words. Sometimes I repeat myself, perhaps. My daughter mentioned it, once. But no, nothing… dramatic, I do not think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory lapses, and your daughter mentioned you repeat yourself occasionally. Do you have any trouble understanding what people are saying to you?
PATIENT: Understanding? No, not usually. People speak… quickly sometimes. And with… many words. But I can follow along, mostly. I just… need to concentrate a little harder, perhaps. No, I do not think I have trouble understanding what is said. It is more… saying what I mean, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. I had my prostate checked, some years ago. That was… routine, I believe. And… I had a bad fall, about ten years ago, broke my wrist. But… no, nothing serious. No high blood pressure, no diabetes. My doctor always said I was… quite healthy, all things considered. I do take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor suggested it.
DOCTOR: Okay, prostate check, broken wrist ten years ago, and vitamin D supplement. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. The wrist, of course, to fix the break. And… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Very common, I believe. But… no, nothing else. No other surgeries that I recall. It was… a long time ago, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family who has had problems with memory loss or dementia?
PATIENT: Family… yes. My mother, she… she became very forgetful in her later years. My sister said it was… dementia, I believe. But it was a long time ago. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… similar problems. He would… wander, and forget who people were. It was… very sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. Dementia in both your mother and your uncle. And finally, before we move on to a brief exam, are you currently taking any other medications besides the vitamin D?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just the vitamin D, I think. I used to take something for my… heartburn, some years ago, but I stopped. My doctor said it was not necessary. No, I do not think I am taking anything else at the moment. I try to avoid medications, if possible, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better sense of how things are functioning. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A quick exam… yes, that is perfectly alright. Just let me know what you would like me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? As tight as I can… I try to keep my hands strong, you see. I used to do a lot of gardening.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Strength appears normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes – don't move your head. Okay, eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your memory. Can you tell me the current year?
PATIENT: The current year… hmm. Let me see… It is… 2025, is it not? Yes, 2025. I believe so.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's correct. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, go ahead. I will do my best to remember them.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. Is that correct? It is… a bit difficult to hold them all in my head, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards.
PATIENT: Spell “world” backwards… hmm. Let me see… D-L-R-O-W. Is that… correct? It is… a bit tricky, you see. My mind feels… slow today.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you please tell me what day of the week it is today?
PATIENT: Today… what day is it? Hmm. It is… Saturday? No, wait… Friday? I always get them mixed up, you see. Is it August 2nd today? Perhaps that will help…
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd, and today is Saturday. Alright, Sherrell. That’s enough for the quick exam for now. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, you're experiencing some difficulties with word recall, memory, and concentration. Given your family history of dementia, it's important we investigate this further. I’m concerned about possible early signs of cognitive impairment.
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment…? Dementia…? Oh dear. That… that is not what I wanted to hear, Doctor. My mother… it was very difficult to watch. What… what does this mean? What do we do now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. It’s natural to be worried. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have dementia, but we need to rule out other possible causes and get a clearer picture. There are many things that can cause these symptoms – vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, even stress and anxiety. The next step is to order some blood tests to check for those things. We’ll also do a more comprehensive cognitive assessment – a series of tests that will look at different aspects of your memory and thinking skills. And I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a more comprehensive assessment… an MRI… Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. If it helps to find out what is happening… then I agree. I just… I want to know. I want to understand. And… and I want to be able to… to think clearly, you see? To remember my daughter’s name… to… to live my life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sherrell. And we will work towards that. We’ll get these tests scheduled as soon as possible. I'll have my nurse draw the blood today. She'll give you instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. The cognitive assessment will take about an hour, and we can schedule that for next week. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that there are things we can do to help manage these symptoms, regardless of the cause. We can discuss strategies to improve your memory, and if necessary, we can explore medication options. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion, just to be thorough. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Strategies… medication… a second opinion… Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very good indeed. Thank you. I… I appreciate your thoroughness. And your kindness. It is… a comfort to know that there are things we can do. Perhaps… perhaps it is not as bad as I fear.
DOCTOR: I certainly hope so, Sherrell. Let's take things one step at a time. I’m going to print out some information about memory improvement techniques for you to review, and a list of questions to think about before your cognitive assessment. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we finish up?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm. Just… one, perhaps. Will… will these tests be painful? And… will they tell me for sure if… if I am like my mother? That is… my biggest fear, you see.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable fear, Sherrell. The blood tests will be a quick prick of the needle, just like any other blood draw – a little discomfort, but nothing significant. The MRI is completely painless – you’ll lie inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still, but it's not uncomfortable. As for whether the tests will definitely tell you if you have dementia… no, no test is 100% definitive. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on, and rule out other possible causes. But a final diagnosis usually requires ongoing observation and assessment. We’ll work together, Sherrell, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. We'll have a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and cognitive assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… Yes, that is… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You have… put my mind at ease, a little. I appreciate your patience… and your honesty. I will… try to remain positive. And I will… do my best to remember everything you have told me.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Sherrell. Just remember to take things one day at a time. My nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and answer any further questions you might have. Do you have any other concerns before I let you get going?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all for now. Thank you again, for everything. I… I feel a little less afraid, if I am honest. I will see you in two weeks, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Take care of yourself, Sherrell. And don't hesitate to call the office if anything comes up before your appointment. We’re here to help. .
PATIENT: .
