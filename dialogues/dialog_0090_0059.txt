DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's a bit…difficult to explain, truthfully. It’s my speech. It hasn’t been quite right lately, feels…slurred, I suppose. It’s just been happening, and my husband suggested I come in. I don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech, you say. And you’re not sure when it began… that's not ideal. It's important to pinpoint these things. Has it been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it was gradual, yes. It didn't just… happen one day. It sort of… got worse over time. But like I said, my memory isn’t the best, so it’s hard to be certain. It's just… been there, slowly, you know? It doesn’t feel sudden at all.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset. Alright. And is this slurred speech constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant, I think. But sometimes it’s worse than others. Like, if I’m very tired, or… stressed, perhaps? It's definitely more noticeable then. But it’s always there, to some degree. Not a huge amount, but… present. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Constant, but exacerbated by fatigue or stress. Do you notice any difficulty understanding what people say to you, or is it only with your own speech?
PATIENT: That's a good question. No, I don’t think I have trouble understanding others. It’s definitely my speech that’s the problem, not hearing. I can hear perfectly fine, as far as I know. It's just… getting the words out right is becoming harder. It feels like my tongue isn’t cooperating sometimes.
DOCTOR: Tongue not cooperating… alright. Have you noticed any weakness in your face or limbs?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. Everything feels… normal, physically. I haven’t dropped anything, or stumbled, or anything like that. My husband hasn’t mentioned anything either, and he’s usually quick to point things out. But I'll have to ask him again just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any history of neurological problems in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… we don’t really talk about medical things much. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had some… issues with her memory when she got older, but I don’t know what they were exactly. Nothing major, as far as I know. No strokes, or anything like that. Honestly, I couldn't say for certain if there’s any history of neurological problems. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, just my usual vitamins. Nothing special, really. A multivitamin, and a vitamin D supplement. Doctor recommended the vitamin D a few years ago. Other than that, nothing at all. No prescriptions, no regular medications. I'm a pretty healthy person, generally. At least, I was, before this speech thing started.
DOCTOR: No medications. Good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and take a look in your mouth and throat. It’s standard procedure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your mouth and throat. Open wide, please. Hmm. Tongue looks normal. No obvious lesions or inflammation. Uvula is midline. Now, I’m going to ask you to stick your tongue out as far as you can. Okay. Now say “light” and “flower” for me. And “baseball”.
PATIENT: “Light.” “Flower.” “Baseball.”
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: I'm trying to squeeze as hard as possible, Doctor. Is that alright? I don't want to hurt you.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Equal strength on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Relax your legs, please. And now your ankles. Reflexes appear normal. Now, can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: How did I do? It feels a little…off, but I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. You’re a little unsteady, but nothing overly concerning at this stage. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Alright. Based on what I’ve gathered so far, and given your history of gradual onset speech difficulties, I suspect you may be experiencing early symptoms of… well, it's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. But possibilities include a neurological issue, or something related to muscle fatigue. It’s too early to make a firm diagnosis.
PATIENT: Neurological issue…? That sounds… serious. What kind of investigation are you thinking of, Doctor? And what does that mean, exactly? I’m a bit worried, to be honest. Is it something… curable? Or… will it get worse? I just want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. It’s important to remember that a potential diagnosis is just that – potential. We need more information before we can say anything for sure. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. It’s a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I also want to order a blood test to check for any vitamin deficiencies or underlying inflammatory conditions. And I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. As for whether it's curable, that depends entirely on the underlying cause. Some neurological conditions are treatable, others are manageable, and some, unfortunately, are progressive. That’s why it’s so important to get an accurate diagnosis. We need to figure out what we’re dealing with before we can discuss treatment options. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests… and a neurologist. That sounds like a lot. Yes, I think I understand. It’s just… a bit overwhelming. What will the neurologist do, exactly? Will they… poke and prod? And how long will it take to get the results of the MRI? I have a job, you know. I can't just… disappear for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The neurologist will perform a more detailed neurological exam, assessing your reflexes, coordination, muscle strength, and cognitive function. They may ask you detailed questions about your medical history and symptoms. And yes, they will likely do some “poking and prodding,” as you put it, but it’s all part of a standard neurological assessment. It shouldn’t be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable. As for the MRI results, typically we can expect them back within 5-7 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. I can also provide you with a note for your employer explaining your need for medical appointments. I’m also going to prescribe a course of Vitamin B12 supplements in the meantime, as a deficiency can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. It won’t hurt, and it may even help if that is the issue. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… better. Vitamin B12… yes, I can manage that. And a note for my employer… that would be very helpful, thank you. So, 5-7 business days for the MRI results… and then another appointment with you and the neurologist? You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’m still worried, of course, but I feel a little less lost now. Should I schedule the MRI appointment now, or…?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. It’s my job to help you navigate this. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. Yes, let’s go ahead and schedule the MRI appointment now. My nurse, Sarah, will come in and handle that for you. She’ll also provide you with the prescription for the Vitamin B12. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. And remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
