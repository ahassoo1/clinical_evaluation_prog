DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. It is… difficult to explain, really. Words… they do not come so easy these days. It is frustrating, you understand? I forget… what I want to say. It is… a trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, memory issues can be concerning. Let's try to be systematic. When did you first start noticing this difficulty with… recalling words, shall we say?
PATIENT: Systematic… yes, good. Hmm… it is… not a sudden thing. Not like a switch. More… a slow fade, perhaps? Months, I think. Maybe… six months? It is hard to say for certain. I remember… struggling more often with conversations. My wife… she would have known, but… She is… gone now. It is… a long time.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive difficulty, you say. And it's impacting your ability to communicate. Alright. Can you describe how it's impacting your conversations?
PATIENT: Impacting… yes. It is like… a word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp it. I know what I mean to say, the idea is there, but the… the name of the thing… it escapes me. Sometimes I use… other words. Wrong words, perhaps. And people look at me… strangely. It is… embarrassing, to be honest. It makes me… less willing to speak.
DOCTOR: So, word-finding difficulties, with a tendency to substitute incorrect words at times. And this is leading you to avoid conversation. Have you noticed any difficulty with understanding what others are saying?
PATIENT: Understanding… hmm. No, not so much. I hear the words, I think. It is my words that are the problem, not theirs. Sometimes… if they speak very quickly, I ask them to repeat. But it is not a… a constant thing. More when I am… tired, perhaps. Or… distracted. It is the speaking, the finding of the right words… that is the trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from this speech issue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Well, I am… older, of course. Some aches and pains, the usual. My memory… is not what it once was, even aside from the words. But I do not feel… unwell. No dizziness, no headaches. Just… a bit tired, sometimes. And… lonely, I suppose. But that is… not a symptom, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through a brief review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. I wear glasses, as you can see. My vision is… blurry without them. But no changes, not that I have noticed. Perhaps a little worse, over time, but that is… expected, yes? Hearing… also, not so good, perhaps. I sometimes ask people to speak up. But again, that is… age, I think. No sudden changes, no ringing in the ears. Just… the normal things.
DOCTOR: Any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No weakness or numbness. My hands… they ache sometimes, the joints, but that is… arthritis, I believe. The doctor… my previous doctor, told me. But no weakness. I can walk, I can lift things. No problems there.
DOCTOR: And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… hmm. That is… a difficult question. I have seen many doctors over the years, of course. I had… arthritis, as I said. And… high blood pressure, I think. It was controlled with… pills. I do not take them anymore, the doctor said it was fine. I had… some surgery, years ago. On my… knee, I believe. But I cannot remember the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I have taken many medications over the years, and never had a… reaction, as far as I can recall. Perhaps a little… stomach upset, sometimes, but nothing serious. I do not believe I have any… allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. That is… a good question. I do not take many, Doctor. Just… some vitamins, perhaps? For my… joints, I think. And… sometimes, a pain reliever, if my knee is bothering me. But not regularly. I do not have a list, I’s afraid.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to perform a brief neurological examination. This will help me assess your cognitive function and rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurological… examination? Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. If it will help me… find my words, then yes. I am… willing to try anything.
DOCTOR: Please sit. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll check your reflexes and coordination. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: The current… date? Hmm. It is… August, I believe. August… the second? Yes, the second. The year… is 2025, is it not? It is… difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: Now, can you spell the word "world"?
PATIENT: "World"? Hmm. W… O… R… L… D. Is that… correct? I am… not very good at spelling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'd like you to repeat these three words after me: apple, table, pencil. Remember them, as I'll ask you to recall them later. Apple… table… pencil.
PATIENT: Apple… table… pencil. Apple… table… pencil. I… I think I have them. Apple, table, pencil. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms.
PATIENT: Reflexes… very well. I am… ready. Though I do not… enjoy being tapped.
DOCTOR: Right leg… good response. Left leg… slightly diminished. Right biceps… good. Left biceps… also diminished. Now, I'd like you to stand and walk a few steps.
PATIENT: Walking… yes. I am… a bit unsteady on my feet today. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that will be sufficient. Please sit down. Based on my preliminary examination, you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with word recall, and some mild lower extremity weakness and diminished reflexes. It is too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Cognitive… difficulties? Weakness? What… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Will I… lose my mind? I just want to… find my words again.
DOCTOR: It is too early to say definitively, Mr. Gyamfi. There are many potential causes for these symptoms. It could be related to age, medication side effects, or a number of other medical conditions. To rule out more serious causes, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. We need to gather more information before we can determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Blood work… an MRI? That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine? I am… on a fixed income, Doctor. Will Medicare… cover those tests? I just want… a simple answer. Why can't I just… remember things?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, Mr. Gyamfi, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles. My office staff will assist you with verifying your coverage and obtaining any necessary pre-authorizations. As for why you are experiencing these difficulties, as I said, there are many possibilities. The tests will help us narrow down the cause. We need to rule out things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and any potential neurological issues. We will proceed systematically. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation once we have the results of these tests. Would you like me to schedule the blood work for you today?
PATIENT: Systematically… yes, that sounds… reasonable. If it will help… find an answer. Please, schedule the blood work. And… the neurologist, if you think it is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please keep me informed. I do not like being… uncertain.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will contact you to schedule the blood work and neurology appointment. They will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that require significant mental effort. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, Doctor. I think… I think you have covered everything. Just… thank you. For… listening. And for trying to… find an answer. I appreciate your… assistance. .
