DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Osterholm. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing to talk about, truly. But I have been… passing a lot of gas. Much more than usual. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? It’s… disruptive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes, I can imagine. A week ago… alright. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not always there, thankfully. But… it is predictable, if that makes sense? Usually after I eat. Or… sometimes even just thinking about food, if I am being honest. It’s… quite strange. It’s not painful, just… loud, and a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Predictable… after eating. Hmm. And what sort of foods are we talking about?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. Everything, really? I work at the fast food place, you see. Burgers, fries… sometimes the chicken. I eat a little bit of everything, Doctor. I haven’t noticed… well, I haven’t tried to notice if one thing is worse than another. I eat what is available, mostly. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Certain foods are… more prone to causing gas than others. The fast food… well, it's not exactly known for being gentle on the digestive system. Let's get a bit of your history. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… you mean… going to the bathroom? No, Doctor, nothing changed there. Regular as clockwork, if you will. Maybe… a little more often since the… gas started, but not a big change. I eat, I… eliminate. It is always the same. I hope that makes sense. It is a little awkward to talk about all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, regular. Good. And any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this… episode?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. Absolutely none. Just the… gas. It’s not uncomfortable, not really. Just… embarrassing, and sometimes… it makes me feel full, even when I haven’t eaten much. But no pain, no sickness, no… other problems. It’s just the… passing of air. A lot of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no nausea, normal bowel movements. Let’s just do a quick examination, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I will… cooperate fully. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the examination table, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently palpate it. Just let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Palpate… that means… pressing, yes? I will let you know if anything feels… strange. Please, proceed at your own pace. I am… ready.
DOCTOR: Okay… bowel sounds are… within normal limits, a little active, perhaps, but nothing alarming. And… no significant tenderness to palpation. A little bit of… gurgling in the lower left quadrant, but nothing concerning. No masses, no guarding. Alright. It sounds like we’re dealing with… fairly benign gas. Likely related to diet.
PATIENT: Benign… that is… good, yes? So, it is not… something serious? The diet… you think the fast food is to blame? I always suspected, but… it is my livelihood, Doctor. What do you suggest? Do I need… medicine? Or some special food?
DOCTOR: It’s not serious, no. But it’s certainly… uncomfortable, and disruptive. And yes, the fast food is highly likely the culprit. It's processed, high in fat, often contains… ingredients that cause gas. I'm not going to tell you what to do with your job, but reducing your intake of those foods would be… beneficial. As for medicine… there are over-the-counter options. Simethicone can help to break up the gas bubbles. But frankly, lifestyle changes are more important. Try to avoid carbonated beverages, beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions… and perhaps, if possible, eat a smaller portion of the fast food. Slowly introduce more fiber into your diet. We're not aiming for perfection here, just… moderation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Carbonated drinks… beans, broccoli… I can try to limit those. It will be… difficult, but I will make an effort. Moderation… yes, that makes sense. Slowly add fiber… is there a… particular food I should start with? And simethicone… I will look for that at the store. Thank you, Doctor. You have… eased my mind considerably. Will this… require another visit?
DOCTOR: Start with something simple like oatmeal, or a small portion of fruit. And, frankly, drinking more water. Hydration helps with digestion. As for a follow-up… if your symptoms don’t improve after a couple of weeks of these changes, or if they worsen, come back and we’ll re-evaluate. It’s likely just a matter of adjusting your diet, but we want to rule out anything more serious if it persists. I'm going to document these recommendations in your chart. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Oatmeal… more water… I can do that. You have been very… thorough and kind. I truly appreciate your patience. Thank you again for your help, Doctor Osterholm. I will follow your advice. I truly will. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. If anything changes, or if you develop any new symptoms, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein.
