DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I am Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. It's this… going to the bathroom. Or, not going, really. It's just gotten harder and harder to… you know, start. It takes me a long time, and sometimes I just can’t get it going at all. It's been happening for… well, a few months now, I'd say. Maybe three or four?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few months, you say. And it's difficulty initiating urination, primarily?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Starting. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s just… weak. Like the stream isn't strong to begin with. And I have to… push, a little. Not a lot, but more than I used to. And then sometimes, after I do go, it feels like I haven't emptied everything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things. Weak stream, hesitancy initiating, a feeling of incomplete emptying… and you've noticed needing to strain a bit. Let me pull up your electronic health record here. Do you have any other urinary symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No burning when I go, and I don’t feel like I have to go all the time, thankfully. And no fever or pain in my back, either. Just the trouble getting it started and feeling like I don't quite empty everything. Oh! And I suppose I've been getting up once or twice a night lately to go, which I didn't used to do. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is. Nocturia – getting up at night to urinate – can be related. Alright, Ms. Yadao, I see you've had a routine physical with Dr. Chen last year, and everything was noted as normal at that time. No history of urinary tract infections or kidney stones, according to the records. Now, let’s delve into a bit more of your medical background. Do you have any significant medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but Dr. Chen got it under control with a small pill. I take it every morning. And… let me see… oh! My knees. They bother me sometimes, arthritis, you know? But that's not related to this, is it? And I had my gallbladder out many years ago. But other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to walk every day.
DOCTOR: Walking is excellent. So, hypertension, managed with medication, and a history of cholecystectomy. And arthritis in the knees. Any family history of kidney problems, prostate issues – if any male relatives have had trouble urinating – or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… let me think. My father had high blood pressure, too. And my brother, on my mother’s side, had… something with his kidneys, I think. Not cancer, though. Just… something. He was always a bit sickly, bless him. And… no, I don’t think anyone else had trouble urinating. My cousins were all quite healthy, as far as I know. And no bladder cancer, thankfully. It's hard to remember sometimes, everything happened so long ago.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Alright, Ms. Yadao. Now, let's talk about your daily habits. How much fluid do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I try to drink at least eight glasses of water, like they say. Maybe a little more if it's hot. I like tea too, a few cups throughout the day. And sometimes juice with my breakfast. I don't drink soda, though. Not a fan. Does that sound like a lot? I don't want to be drinking too much!
DOCTOR: No, that sounds reasonable. Eight glasses of water and tea is perfectly acceptable. Now, Ms. Yadao, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes. And finally, I'd like to perform a digital rectal exam. This is to assess the size and tone of your prostate. It’s standard procedure for men experiencing these symptoms. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a… a rectal exam? Well… I… I wasn't expecting that. Is it… necessary? What will it tell you that listening to my tummy won't? I'm not comfortable with that, if you don't mind. I’ve… had those before, and I really don’t care for them. Could we try something else first?
DOCTOR: While I understand your discomfort, Ms. Yadao, a digital rectal exam is often crucial in evaluating the prostate, which can contribute to urinary symptoms in men. It allows me to assess its size, shape, and consistency, and to identify any potential abnormalities. I assure you, it is a quick procedure. However, if you are absolutely opposed to it, we can proceed without it, but it will limit my ability to accurately diagnose the cause of your symptoms. We could start with a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. That will give us some information, but it won’t be as comprehensive. What do you think?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s really necessary… okay. But please be quick. And gentle. I just… don’t like them. I'd rather have the tests first, if that's alright. The urinalysis and the… post-void thing. Let’s see what those show before we do anything else. I'm just… nervous, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Yadao. We will start with the urinalysis and post-void residual volume test. I’ll have the nurse come in and collect a urine sample from you. Then, after you urinate, we will use a handheld device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. That will give us a baseline assessment. After we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And thank you for explaining everything. It’s just… I don't like feeling like something is wrong. It worries me. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Understandable. We'll get this done as quickly as possible. The nurse should be in shortly. The results typically take about 15-20 minutes. I'll review them with you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to relax. It's important not to jump to conclusions before we have all the information. Just focus on providing a clean urine sample.
PATIENT: Okay. I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor.
