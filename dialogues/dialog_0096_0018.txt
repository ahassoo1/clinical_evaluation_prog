DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, well, it’s a bit… awkward to explain, truthfully. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather a lot lately. More than usual, you understand. It’s… disruptive, to be frank. I don’t quite recall when it started, just that it’s been… a while now.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. It interferes with… well, everything, really. I find myself constantly needing to locate a facility. It’s… inconvenient, particularly when I’m out and about. It's not painful, thankfully, just… frequent. I don't remember ever having anything like this before. Perhaps it's just age, though I hesitate to assume.
DOCTOR: Age does bring about changes, Mr. Verbos, but we shouldn’t simply assume. How often would you say “often” is?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s… a difficult question. It feels like every hour or so, perhaps? It varies, of course. Sometimes it’s a bit longer, sometimes… not. At night, it’s worse, I think. I’ve gotten up… several times a night to go. It's hard to say exactly, as I don’t keep a precise log. I apologize for the vagueness. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Several times a night… and during the day, every hour or so. Alright. And is it a full bladder each time, or just a small amount?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Usually… full, I believe. Yes, a substantial amount each time. Not just a little trickle, definitely. Though, on occasion, perhaps it is smaller, but generally, it’s a complete emptying. It's difficult to quantify precisely, you understand. I try not to dwell on such things. It’s… unpleasant to think about, frankly. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not being too… verbose. I do tend to ramble, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I need you to be precise with me. This isn't a social call. Full bladder each time, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You are right to press me. Most of the time, yes, a full bladder. Though, now that I think about it, there have been a couple of instances… in the past week, perhaps… where it wasn't quite full. More like… half. But those are exceptions, truly. I apologize for the initial imprecision. I truly don't mean to be difficult, it's just… I don't typically focus on these details, you see. It's a bit embarrassing to discuss, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… Well, I’ve been rather thirsty lately, I suppose. More so than usual. I find myself reaching for water quite often. And… now that you mention it, I’ve felt a bit… tired. Not debilitatingly so, just… lacking energy. It’s difficult to say if that's related, of course. I've also had a slight… blurring of vision occasionally, but I attributed that to my reading glasses needing adjusting. I don't recall anything else significant. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Thirsty, tired, blurry vision… Hmm. Do you have any family history of… well, anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some health problems, but I’m afraid my recollections are rather vague. I believe she had issues with her… circulation? And perhaps some problems with her kidneys, but that was many years ago, and I wasn't terribly involved in her care. My father was quite robust, as far as I recall. He lived to a good age, thankfully. I don’t believe either of them had anything specifically resembling this, but… truthfully, I couldn’t say with any certainty. I wasn’t a particularly attentive son regarding medical details, I’m afraid. Is that… unhelpful? I apologize again for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: It is what it is, Mr. Verbos. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just one, thankfully. For my… blood pressure. A small dose, prescribed by my previous doctor. I believe it’s called… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. I take it every morning. Other than that, nothing. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in a healthy diet and regular exercise, though my energy levels haven’t been conducive to much exercise lately, as I mentioned. I’ve also been taking a multivitamin, but that's hardly a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. I occasionally have a bit of… hay fever in the springtime, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I once had a slight rash after eating shellfish, but that was many years ago, and I’ve avoided shellfish ever since, just to be safe. Nothing serious, thankfully. I don’t recall ever having a truly allergic reaction to any medication. I apologize if that’s… unhelpful. I strive to be thorough, but my memory… you understand. Is there anything else I should mention? Perhaps my fondness for chamomile tea? It’s hardly relevant, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is irrelevant, Mr. Verbos. Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you require any assistance. My joints aren't as… pliable as they once were. Do you require me to remove my shoes?
DOCTOR: No, shoes on is fine. Just stand still, please. 182 centimeters, 141 pounds… Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. A little tender, perhaps, here… on the left side. But nothing… acute. Just a general… sensitivity. It’s difficult to describe. I occasionally experience a bit of… discomfort in that area, unrelated to this current issue, I believe. It’s probably just indigestion. Oh, there… a little sharper there. But it’s fleeting. I apologize for being so… imprecise.
DOCTOR: Left side tenderness, fleeting. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Now, I need a urine sample. I’ll leave you with a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample. Don’t flush, I’ll be back shortly.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A mid-stream sample… yes, of course. I believe I recall the procedure… though it’s been some time. Do you require me to knock before I return? I wouldn’t want to… intrude.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I trust I’ve followed the instructions correctly? It was… slightly awkward, to be frank, but I believe I managed a reasonably… representative sample. Please do let me know if you require any further… specimens.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll send this off to the lab. While we’re waiting for the results, let’s discuss your symptoms further. Given your frequent urination, thirst, and occasional blurry vision, and the fact that you're taking a medication for blood pressure, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I suspect we're dealing with something more than just a simple bladder irritation. We need to check your blood sugar levels. Are you aware of any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes…? Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My aunt, perhaps? On my mother’s side? I believe she had some… complications later in life. Weight issues, if I recall correctly. And a rather sweet tooth. But I don’t know if that was specifically… diabetes. It was many years ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to her. I don't recall any other instances of diabetes in the family, but my memory… you understand. I apologize for my vagueness. Is that… unhelpful? Should I perhaps inquire with my cousins? They might recall something I've forgotten.
DOCTOR: It is what it is, Mr. Verbos. Alright. We'll proceed with the blood work. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood sugar test. We’ll also check your kidney function. The lab results should be back in a couple of days. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks. Do not self-treat. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Plenty of water, avoid sugary drinks, do not self-treat… yes, I understand perfectly. I assure you, I have no intention of resorting to any… unconventional remedies. I trust your expertise implicitly. And I shall refrain from excessive… chamomile tea, just to be safe. When should I expect your call? A couple of days, you said? I suppose I should remain… readily available. Is there a specific time of day I should be particularly vigilant? I wouldn’t want to… miss your call.
DOCTOR: Within two business days, Mr. Verbos. I will leave a message if I am unable to reach you. No need to be "vigilant," just answer the phone. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been… remarkably thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. I trust you will keep me informed of your progress. Thank you again for your time and expertise. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns as simply… aging.
