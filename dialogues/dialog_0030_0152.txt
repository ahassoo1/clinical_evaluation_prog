DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the lab, it seems my cholesterol is a little high. That's what it said, anyway. I don’t really understand all that stuff, but it sounded like I should come talk to someone.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good you came in to discuss it. A high cholesterol reading can certainly warrant a conversation. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little more about when you received this letter?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was about a week ago, maybe a little less. I had some blood work done as part of my yearly check-up with my regular doctor. Then this letter just showed up in the mail a few days later. It had a lot of numbers on it, and I mostly just skimmed it, to be honest. Numbers aren’t my strong suit.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Geho. That's what I'm here for – to help you understand it. Do you happen to have a copy of that letter with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! Here it is. I brought it just in case. It’s a little crumpled, sorry. I had it tucked in with my grocery list.
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is helpful. Okay, so I see your total cholesterol is 240, your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 150. These numbers do indicate that your cholesterol is elevated, as the letter suggested. To get a better picture of what might be contributing to this, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask you a few questions. First, have you been diagnosed with high cholesterol previously?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time I’ve ever heard about it, honestly. I’ve always felt pretty healthy. I eat okay, I think… not a lot of fast food, mostly just regular meals. And I try to walk a little bit most days, when the weather is nice. I’m not a marathon runner or anything, but I’m not a couch potato either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It’s certainly possible to have elevated cholesterol even with a relatively healthy lifestyle. Let’s talk a little more about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, a typical day… Well, for breakfast I usually have oatmeal with some fruit, maybe a banana or some berries. Sometimes toast with a little bit of jam. Lunch is usually a sandwich – turkey or ham on whole wheat bread – with a side salad. And for dinner… it varies. Sometimes I’ll cook chicken or fish with roasted vegetables. Other times I’ll have something simpler, like soup and a salad. I do like a little chocolate after dinner, if I’m being honest. A small square or two.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fairly balanced diet, Ms. Geho. The chocolate is perfectly fine in moderation. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I know that for sure. She was on medication for it for years. And my father… he had a heart attack when he was in his early seventies, but I don’t know if it was related to cholesterol or something else. He wasn’t very good about going to the doctor, so we never really knew much about his health. My brother seems healthy enough, but we don’t talk that often, so I’m not really sure about his medical history. It’s a bit of a mystery, really.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked when I was a little girl, and I hated the smell. It always made me cough. So, no, definitely not a smoker. And I don’t drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't. As far as I know, I’m not allergic to anything. I haven’t had to take a lot of medication over the years, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache or something minor. I did have a reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. I think it was just a rash. They said I shouldn’t take it again, obviously.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Geho. That’s all the questions I have for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and looking at your lab results, it appears you have elevated cholesterol. We need to address this to reduce your risk of heart disease. Before we talk about treatment options, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m ready whenever you are. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s a little worrying, finding out something like this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's perfectly natural to be concerned. We'll work through this together. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. I'm going to wrap this cuff around your arm. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your weight and height. You're 5'6" and weigh 124 pounds. That gives you a BMI of 20, which is within a healthy range. Finally, I'll just briefly examine your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. But, the elevated cholesterol reading does warrant attention.
PATIENT: Okay, good. I mean, good that things seem normal otherwise. So, what does this all mean? Do I need to take pills? I've heard those cholesterol medications can have side effects. I’d really like to avoid medication if possible, if we can. What are my other options?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Geho. Many people are concerned about starting medication, and it's good you're thinking proactively. Let's talk about your options. The first step, and often the most effective, is lifestyle modification. This includes dietary changes – reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and eating more fruits and vegetables. Regular exercise is also crucial – at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Losing even a few pounds can make a difference. We can start with a three-month trial of these lifestyle changes and recheck your cholesterol levels then. If your numbers haven't improved enough, we can discuss medication options. There are several types of cholesterol medications available – statins are the most common, but there are others. They do have potential side effects, as you mentioned, but many people tolerate them very well. We would carefully monitor you if you were to start medication to ensure you're not experiencing any adverse effects. Do you feel comfortable trying the lifestyle modification approach first?
PATIENT: Yes, I think that sounds good. I’d really prefer to try that before jumping into medication. I mean, I’m already fairly active and I try to eat healthy, but maybe I need to be more… focused. Do you have any specific recommendations for diet? Like, what exactly should I be eating more of, and what should I try to avoid? And what kind of exercise is best? I mostly just walk, is that enough?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a great first step. Here's a handout from the American Heart Association with detailed dietary recommendations. Essentially, you want to focus on foods that are low in saturated and trans fats, and high in fiber. That means lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein like fish and chicken, and healthy fats like olive oil and avocados. Try to limit red meat, processed foods, sugary drinks, and fried foods. Regarding exercise, walking is a fantastic start! Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Moderate intensity means you should be able to talk, but not sing, comfortably. You could also incorporate other activities you enjoy, like swimming, cycling, or dancing. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a personalized meal plan and provide guidance on making healthy food choices. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A registered dietitian sounds like a really good idea. I think I need someone to actually tell me what to eat, instead of just reading about it. I’m not very good at planning meals. And thank you for the handout, that’s helpful too. So, three months of lifestyle changes, and then we recheck my cholesterol? And the dietitian will help me with the food part? Is there anything else I need to do? Like, are there any over-the-counter supplements I should be taking? I’ve heard some things about… things like red yeast rice.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. That’s exactly right – three months of lifestyle changes, then we’ll recheck your cholesterol levels. And yes, the dietitian will help you develop a personalized meal plan and provide guidance on making healthy food choices. I’ll write a referral for you now. Regarding supplements, that’s a good question. Many people ask about red yeast rice, and it can help lower cholesterol levels. However, it’s not regulated by the FDA, and the potency can vary significantly. It can also interact with other medications, so it’s best to avoid it unless discussed with a healthcare professional. There are a few other supplements that might be helpful, like omega-3 fatty acids and plant sterols, but the evidence is mixed. I generally recommend focusing on diet and exercise first, and then we can discuss supplements if needed. I'm also going to provide you with a printout about heart-healthy living, which includes information about stress management and the importance of sleep. These factors can also impact your cholesterol levels. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. That was a lot of information, but it doesn’t seem overwhelming, actually. You explained everything really well, Doctor. And I appreciate you not just immediately prescribing pills. I feel much better about this now. Thank you. So, I’ll see the dietitian, and then come back in three months? And you’ll give me the papers for the dietitian and the heart-healthy living thing?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could help. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed about your health. Yes, exactly. I'll print out the referral for the dietitian and the heart-healthy living information for you now. Please schedule an appointment with the dietitian at your convenience. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment in three months. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Ms. Geho. I look forward to seeing you then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Quicksey. You too!
