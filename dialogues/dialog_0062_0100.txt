DOCTOR: Hi Lytisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I think it’s for a… a check-up? Something about making sure I'm alright. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? Something about a test… is it a blood test? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. It's very common for things to be a little fuzzy, and we can definitely sort it all out. You're right to come in for a check-up. It sounds like your primary care physician may have ordered some routine blood work and wanted me to review the results with you and do a physical exam. Before we dive into that, let’s just talk a little bit about why you came in today, even if it's just a general feeling. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms, like fatigue, weight changes, pain anywhere, or anything else that's been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, no, not really. Nothing specific. I feel… alright, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I mostly just wanted to get it over with, to be honest. My doctor, she’s a good woman, but she talks so fast! It’s hard to keep up, and I always forget what she says as soon as I leave the office. Is this… is this about drugs? I think she mentioned something about that… a screening, maybe? It's all a bit of a blur, really. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lytisha. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when things are explained quickly. And yes, it’s possible your doctor mentioned a screening. We do routine screenings for a variety of things as part of a general check-up, and sometimes those include tests that look for certain medications or substances. But we'll get to all of that. Let’s just start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… Hmm. Let me think. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. Not serious, they said. Just needed to take some pills for a while. And… arthritis, I suppose. My hands ache sometimes, especially when it’s cold. Other than that… not really. I think. Honestly, it feels like a lifetime ago. And the doctors… so many doctors over the years! It’s hard to remember everything. Was I diabetic? I think someone said something about that once… I really can’t recall. It’s awful, this memory.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lytisha. We can take our time and try to piece things together. It's very common for patients to have trouble remembering details from the past, especially if they've seen many different doctors. It sounds like you've had some heart issues in the past and are dealing with some arthritis, which is very common. And you mentioned possibly being told you were diabetic at some point?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I think so. It was… after my husband passed. Everything was a bit of a blur then. I remember a doctor talking about sugar levels and needing to watch what I eat. But I don’t think I ever started any treatment for it. I just… kind of forgot about it, to be honest. I really don't remember being told to take any pills or anything. Maybe I wasn't. Maybe it wasn't that serious. It's just… so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like there's a possibility of a previous diabetes diagnosis, but no ongoing treatment. We’ll definitely want to check your current blood sugar levels to get a clearer picture. Now, let’s talk about any surgeries you may have had. Have you ever had any operations or procedures done?
PATIENT: Hmm… Oh, yes! I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… uncomfortable. And… I think I had a hysterectomy, but that was a long time ago, before my husband got sick. Other than that… not that I recall. I broke my wrist once, when I was a child, but that was just a cast. No surgery, I don't think. It was so long ago, it's hard to be sure. Do you have records somewhere? Maybe they have it all written down.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. We can certainly look up your records, and I'll check the system to see what information we have available. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother had heart problems, I think. She died when I was young, so I don’t remember much. My father… he was healthy as a horse, always working. He lived a long life, thankfully. My brother had some trouble with his weight, and I think he had diabetes later in life. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had cancer, but it was a long time ago. That’s all I can really remember, to be honest. It wasn't a family that talked much about their health. It was more… do things, don't complain. You know?
DOCTOR: I understand. That's quite common, unfortunately. It sounds like there's a history of heart disease and diabetes on your mother and brother’s sides, and cancer in your aunt. That's helpful information. Now, just a couple more questions about your history, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. I'm not allergic to penicillin, I think. The doctor asked me that once. But other than that… no, I don’t think I have any allergies. I do get itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the weather. Or the dust. Or something. I don't think it's an allergy. It’s just… itchy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven't had any significant allergic reactions. Itchy skin isn't necessarily a cause for concern, but we can always investigate further if it becomes bothersome. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… um… Let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a while ago. Said it was too low. And… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when my hands really ache. Just an over-the-counter pain reliever, nothing fancy. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, Doctor DeCosta. My daughter told me to. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That's about it, I think. Just the vitamin D, and the occasional pain reliever. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Lytisha. So, you used to take medication for blood pressure but are currently off of it, you take an occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis, and a vitamin D supplement. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this over with, to be honest. Just tell me if it's going to hurt, alright? I'm not as young as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Of course, Lytisha. I’ll explain everything as I go, and it shouldn’t hurt at all. It’s just a routine check. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. … 128 over 76. That’s looking good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just take slow, deep breaths for me… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing hurts there. Oh, that’s a little tender, right there. But that's probably just… I ate a big lunch. I always get a little tender after lunch. It's probably nothing. I do love my food. What about my hands? They ache something awful today. It’s been a cold week, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some swelling in your knuckles, and they do feel tender to the touch. This is consistent with arthritis. Now, just to complete the exam, I’m going to check your reflexes. … Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon with age. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything looks generally good, Lytisha, but we do have a few things to investigate further based on your history and the exam. I’d like to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, liver function, and vitamin D levels. We can also do a complete blood count to get a better idea of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work, okay. I suppose I can handle that. Will it take long? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I don't want to miss it. And will I have to fast? I really don’t like to fast. I get so grumpy when I don't eat.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lytisha. I'll try to minimize any inconvenience. Yes, for the most accurate results, we do need you to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. I know it’s not ideal, but it’s important for getting a clear picture. We can schedule the blood draw for first thing in the morning on Wednesday, so you'll be able to eat normally after that. As for the bridge game on Thursday, you should be perfectly fine! Once we get the results back, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. It's possible we may need to adjust your vitamin D supplement dosage or consider other options for managing your arthritis. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Wednesday morning is fine. First thing, okay. And you said I can eat after? That’s good. Managing the arthritis… that sounds good too. It really aches something awful in the cold. So, that's all? I don’t have to do anything else right now? Just fast until Wednesday? I’m terrible with remembering things, you know. Just tell me exactly what I need to do. And write it down for me, please. My daughter always says I forget everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for now, Lytisha. Just fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw on Wednesday morning. You can drink water, but no food or anything else. Here's a note with all the instructions written down. It includes the lab address and phone number, as well as a reminder to fast. And just to recap, we’ll be checking your blood sugar, kidney function, liver function, and vitamin D levels. Once we get the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly. Fast for eight hours… Wednesday morning… Lab address… Yes, I think I have it. Thank you, Doctor DeCosta. You’ve been very patient with me. My memory just isn’t what it used to be, you know. I guess I’ll see you next week then. Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lytisha. It was my pleasure. And don't worry about your memory, it's perfectly normal. Just take things one step at a time. Have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Feel free to call the office if you have any questions before then. .
