DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my…well, my toilet habits, I suppose. Not something a man likes to talk about, but here we are. I noticed some…red in the bowl this morning. Blood, I reckon. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a fella uneasy. And frankly, at my age, I don’t need any more things to worry about.
DOCTOR: Red in the bowl, you say. Very well. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Just this morning. First time I’ve seen anything like it. Though, I have been a bit…backed up, lately. Not a regular as I used to be, if you catch my drift. Always ate right, though. Proper Haida diet, mostly. Not like these youngsters and their…fast food.
DOCTOR: Backed up, you say. A change in bowel habits…and this blood this morning. And you attribute the constipation to…dietary changes, or simply age?
PATIENT: Age, mostly. Though, I did try one of those fancy prune juices my daughter sent. Said it would “get things moving.” Didn’t do a lick of good, if you ask me. Just tasted like…well, prunes. And made the whole situation worse, frankly. I stick to my salmon and berries, thank you very much. Proper food for a proper man.
DOCTOR: Prune juice, hmm. Unreliable, at best. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I need to ask a few more direct questions. This is all part of the process, you understand. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea alongside this…constipation and blood?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A bit of discomfort, maybe. Like a dull ache, low down. Nothing to write home about. And no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. I’m a sturdy man, Dr. Blim. Don’t get sick easily. Though, I did feel a bit weak this morning after…well, you know. Maybe that was just from the fright of it all.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say. And no fever, no chills, no recent changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No fever. And my appetite’s been fine, thank you very much. Still enjoy a good meal. Though, maybe not as much as I used to. A man slows down at eighty-eight, you know. But I haven't lost my taste for salmon, that's for certain. It's just... everything feels a little sluggish these days. Old age, I suppose. It's a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Just a quick examination of your abdomen and, if you’ll permit, a rectal exam. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now see here, Doctor. I’m an old man, and I’ve lived a long life. I don’t particularly relish the thought of that. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just give me something for the…backed up part and be done with it? I’m not keen on poking and prodding at my age, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, a thorough examination is essential. We are attempting to determine the cause of the bleeding, not simply treat a symptom. It could be a simple matter, or it could be…something more serious. I cannot, in good conscience, simply prescribe a laxative without a proper assessment. The examination will be quick and discreet. It is a professional procedure, and frankly, your reluctance is…unhelpful. Do you consent to the examination, or shall we discuss a referral to another physician?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your poking and prodding. But make it quick, Doctor. And be gentle, mind you. I haven't got all day, and my patience is wearing thin. Honestly, the indignity of it all... a man's privacy these days... It's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table, face up, and relax. I will need you to bend your knees. And I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. Now, I will be palpating your abdomen first, noting any tenderness or masses. This will be followed by the rectal exam. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little. Right there…that spot. Just a bit tender. Not sharp pain, just…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, as I said before. Honestly, Doctor, you’re pressing rather hard.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Noted. And no rebound tenderness?
PATIENT: Re…what now? What’s “rebound tenderness”? Are you talking about my stomach bouncing? I don’t know medical jargon, Doctor. Just tell me if it hurts, alright? And stop poking so hard!
DOCTOR: Rebound tenderness refers to pain when I release pressure. Never mind. It is not relevant at the moment. Now, I’m going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This is to assess for any abnormalities, masses, or sources of bleeding. Please take a deep breath. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Ugh. Not comfortable, Doctor. Not comfortable at all. Just get it over with. Honestly, the things a man has to endure…
DOCTOR: Alright. Examination complete. I detected no obvious masses. There was some stool present, and I noted a small amount of…bright red blood on the glove. Not a significant amount, but enough to confirm your observation. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, based on this preliminary examination, and given your age and symptoms, I suspect this could be a minor hemorrhoid flare-up, possibly exacerbated by constipation. However, we cannot rule out other possibilities without further investigation. I am going to order a complete blood count and a fecal occult blood test. This will help determine if there is any internal bleeding and assess your overall health. Also, I recommend a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Now you're talking nonsense, Doctor. I'm eighty-eight years old! What good would poking around there do? I’ve lived a long life, and if something’s going to happen, it’s going to happen. I don’t need any unnecessary procedures. Blood test, alright. Maybe. But no colonoscopy. Absolutely not. And don't expect me to come back just for that test. It's a waste of time and a waste of my energy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, declining a colonoscopy is… unwise. It is the gold standard for detecting potential problems in the colon, such as polyps or cancer. While you may feel healthy, these conditions often present no symptoms in their early stages. A simple test could save your life. However, I understand your reluctance. I will not force you to undergo a procedure you do not want. But I strongly advise you to reconsider. I will order the complete blood count and fecal occult blood test as you requested. We can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment. But please understand, without further investigation, we cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. But that's it. No more poking and prodding, alright? As for allergies… I think I had a bit of a reaction to some penicillin when I was a boy. Just a rash, nothing serious. But I haven't taken it in decades. Honestly, Doctor, the amount of questions… I used to be a man who could handle anything. Now I'm just answering medical quizzes.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I will send the lab orders to the front desk. You can have the blood drawn here at the clinic. It will take approximately fifteen minutes. Once the results are available, we will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I strongly urge you to consider a referral to a gastroenterologist. They are specialists in digestive health and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fiber intake and staying well-hydrated. These simple measures can help alleviate your constipation. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Now you want me to see another doctor? Just ridiculous. Look, I appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I've lived a long life, and I know my body. I'll try the fiber and water, alright? That's enough poking and prodding for one day. No, I don't have any more questions. Just want to get this over with and go home. Honestly, I haven't been this annoyed since my ex-wife started collecting porcelain dolls.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. As you wish. The front desk will provide you with the lab requisition. Please schedule the blood draw at your earliest convenience. I wish you good health. And please, reconsider the referral. Ignoring potential problems will not make them disappear. Some people… .
PATIENT: .
