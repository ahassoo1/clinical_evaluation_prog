DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain. My strength, it’s been… going away. Little by little. It's been happening for a while now, and it worries my wife, Leilani. She’s the one who really wanted me to come see someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores, I understand. It's good that Leilani encouraged you to come in. Gradual loss of strength is definitely something we should investigate. When you say “a while now,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, maybe… six months ago? At first, I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it’s not stopping. It’s in my legs mostly. Makes walking a bit… tricky sometimes. I used to be very strong, worked with the football team at the high school for many years. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Six months… that’s helpful. And it’s primarily in your legs, making walking difficult. You mentioned working with the football team – that sounds like you were quite active. Has this weakness affected anything else besides walking?
PATIENT: Yes, the football team… good times. And yes, it’s not just my legs. My hands, they get tired easier now. Holding things… like this cup of water… it feels heavier than it used to. And sometimes… my words get mixed up. Not all the time, but enough for Leilani to notice. She says I slur sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're talking weakness in both your legs and hands, along with some difficulty with speech – slurring occasionally. That’s important information. Has there been any pain associated with the weakness?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That’s the strange thing. It’s just… tired. Like I’ve been running a marathon, but I haven’t. Just tired. And… wobbly, sometimes. Especially my legs. It’s a little scary when I feel like I might fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just fatigue and a feeling of wobbliness, particularly in your legs. That helps narrow things down. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well… I had a problem with my balance a few years back. The doctor said it was something with my nerves. They gave me some pills, and it went away. Aside from that… not much. I've been pretty lucky, I think. Leilani keeps me eating right, and I try to stay active, even if it’s harder now. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the balance issue a few years ago and that it resolved with medication. And yes, Medicare is helpful information. Do you recall what the doctor told you the nerve problem was?
PATIENT: Hmm… It was a long time ago. Something about… multiple… sclerosis? That’s what I think she said. But she said it was mild, and she gave me pills, and I felt better. I didn’t really ask many questions, to be honest. I just wanted to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, though it sounds like it was mild and resolved with treatment. We’ll need to look into that further. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had to. Just a few broken bones when I was a young man, playing football. Nothing serious. They healed up fine. Mostly bumps and bruises, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Good. No surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, she had… trouble remembering things when she got older. Leilani says it might have been dementia, but we didn’t really know for sure back then. My father, he was strong as an ox until the day he died. Heart problems, I think. But that was many years ago. Nothing else that I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, potential dementia in your mother and heart problems in your father. And you said Leilani keeps you eating right... Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Leilani makes sure of that. She's very careful about what I eat. I eat mostly fish and vegetables. She says it's good for my health. And I don’t take many pills, except for the ones the doctor gave me for my balance a few years back.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and minimal medication use. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your reflexes, strength, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Leilani always said I should have gone to the doctor sooner, so… let’s get this done. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could sit here for me, please. First, let's check your blood pressure. A little elevated, but not critically high. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds good there. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can relax my legs. Leilani always tells me to relax, especially when I get worried. She has a way of calming me down. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try my best to stay still.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes seem normal. Now I'm assessing your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright, Doctor? It doesn't feel quite as strong as it used to, but I’m trying.
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. Your strength is a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, let's check your balance. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. But… it's a little wobbly. Leilani always says I shouldn't stand for too long without something to hold onto.
DOCTOR: Okay, just try to stand with one foot directly in front of the other, like you're walking a straight line. Don’t worry if it’s difficult.
PATIENT: Oh dear! That's… not good. See? It's hard for me to keep my balance. It feels like I'm going to fall. Leilani would have known this would happen. She always knows.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s good we’re checking this. Based on the exam, the weakness and balance issues are concerning. Given your history of a previous balance problem, and the mild weakness, I'd like to order some blood tests, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any underlying neurological causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI, Doctor? That sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. Whatever you need, just let me know. And… is it going to hurt? Leilani always worries about things like that.
DOCTOR: No, an MRI doesn't hurt, Mr. Astores. It's a bit loud, and you'll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes, but there's no pain involved. We'll get the results sent to me as soon as they're available, usually within a few days. While we're waiting for those results, I'd like to refer you to a neurologist - a specialist in nerve and brain disorders - for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A specialist, yes. That sounds good. Leilani will be glad to hear that. She always says it’s best to get a second opinion. Thirty minutes, you say? I can manage thirty minutes. As long as I can lie down and rest. Do I need to do anything special before the MRI? And… the neurologist, will they be able to tell me what’s wrong? I just want to know what's going on, you know?
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Astores. For the MRI, you can eat and drink normally beforehand. Just let them know if you have any metal implants or anything like that. As for the neurologist, they’ll be able to review the MRI results and conduct further tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. It’s unlikely they'll have a definitive answer immediately, but they'll be able to provide a more accurate assessment and recommend a treatment plan. I’ll have my nurse give you a referral form for a Dr. Evelyn Reed, she's excellent. In the meantime, please try to avoid any strenuous activities, and be careful with your balance. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty speaking, vision changes, or severe weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. And thank you for listening to me. It’s a relief to finally be getting some answers. Leilani will be so happy. I'll be careful with my balance, and I'll tell her everything you said. Thank you, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could help. My nurse will be in shortly to give you the referral form and schedule the MRI. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. And please give Leilani my best. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
