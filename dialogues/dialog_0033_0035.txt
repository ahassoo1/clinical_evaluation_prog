DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Sucich, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Mirriam Sucich. Though everyone just calls me Mirriam. It’s nice to meet you, Dr. – is it Dechêne?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. And you can call me Dr. Dechêne if you must. Though frankly, let's get straight to it. You're 86… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s these hiccups. Been going on for… goodness, nearly a week now. Just come and go, you know? Not painful, thankfully, just… annoying. Really annoying! I was hoping you could have a look.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week. Started last Tuesday, I think it was. After I had a particularly good laugh with my grandson, actually. He's a funny boy, that one. But it hasn't stopped since! It’s just… hic …unexpected. See? There it is again.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you tried anything to… resolve it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes! Everything my mother ever told me, and a few things I read online. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, a spoonful of sugar… even getting someone to scare me! Nothing seems to work for very long, if at all. It just… hic …keeps coming back. It’s getting a bit tiring, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, hiccups in someone your age… we need to rule out anything serious. Let's start with a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, I suppose. Where would you like me to start? And, if you don’t mind my asking, is there anything in particular you’re looking for? Just so I’m not unnecessarily worried.
DOCTOR: Just lie back, please. I'll listen to your lungs, feel your abdomen... routine things. We're checking for anything that might be irritating the diaphragm. It's unlikely to be anything drastic, but at your age, one must be thorough. Now, breathe deeply, if you can, despite… the issue.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Diaphragm, you say? Oh dear. Never had any trouble with that before. There it is again! Honestly, it’s like a little man jumping up and down inside me. I'll try my best to breathe deeply, though. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear… a little diminished breath sounds, expected for your age. Abdomen is soft, no obvious masses or tenderness… though you are a little tender here on the left side. Any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, diet… not really, no. I try to eat fairly healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, fish a couple of times a week. I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea, though. Can’t live without my biscuits, you know. But no, nothing major has changed. I haven't been sick or anything. I did try a new brand of tea last week… a herbal one. Could that be it? I suppose anything is possible.
DOCTOR: A new tea… possibly. It's unlikely to be the sole cause, but we need to consider everything. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I sleep alright, though I wake up a bit more than I used to. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I suppose. My appetite’s been normal, no heartburn or indigestion. Oh! Except… my grandson says I’ve been a bit more forgetful lately. But he’s probably just exaggerating. He's a mischievous one, that boy. Though… I did forget where I put my glasses this morning. Twice. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness... at 86, some degree of cognitive decline is… common. But we’ll note it. Let’s get a basic blood panel done. Just to rule out anything obvious. And I'm going to order a chest X-ray. Purely precautionary. It’s probably nothing, but we need to be thorough. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the X-ray.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood panel and an X-ray. Sounds… thorough, as you say. I suppose it's best to be safe. Will the X-ray be uncomfortable? I haven't had one of those in years. And will the nurse be gentle with the blood draw? My veins aren’t what they used to be. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is painless, simply standing still for a few moments. The nurse is experienced. She'll find a vein. It might sting a little, but it’s quick. I'll review the results as soon as they are available and we'll discuss them then. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and… avoid anything that might trigger the hiccups. Though frankly, at this point, it's likely just… an annoyance. Next patient. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the nurse then. It all sounds rather… routine. Though I do wish you’d look at me when you’re speaking. It feels a bit… impersonal, you know? Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try to stay hydrated. .
