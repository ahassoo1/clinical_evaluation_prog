DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, frankly, I haven’t much time for this. My wife insisted. She says my skin… is looking rather unpleasant. And I tire easily, you see. Simply dreadful fatigue. It’s probably nothing, really. A waste of everyone’s time, if you ask me. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in, even if it was at your wife’s urging. We want to make sure everything is alright. “Unpleasant skin” and fatigue… those can be caused by many things, so it's good to check it out. To help me understand, can you tell me a little more about this skin issue?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's difficult to say. It's… darker, I suppose. A bit… dingy looking. And not where one would expect. I’ve worked with iron my entire life, you understand. Reinforcing, rebar… it’s a dirty profession. But this isn’t just dirt. It’s… pervasive. It’s all over, really. And it’s been… gradual. I don't recall when it started precisely. Decades, probably. It’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, “darker skin” that's been gradual over decades… and not easily explained by work-related dirt. It's helpful to try to pinpoint when you first noticed it, but I understand it's difficult to recall exactly. And you mentioned fatigue. Is this a recent development, or has it been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Decades, as I said. Look, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I’ve built things with my hands my entire life. Fatigue comes with the territory. Always have been tired at the end of the day. It’s… acceptable. I suspect it’s simply the natural progression of… being old. Really, I don’t see what there is to investigate. It's just how things are. Are we nearly finished? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Drahota. And it’s true, fatigue can be a normal part of aging. But long-standing fatigue, combined with the changes in your skin, warrants a closer look, just to rule out anything serious. It's important to be thorough. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Doctor, I've rarely been to a doctor. A few scrapes and bruises over the years, of course. But nothing serious. I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. Strong as an ox, I was. Though… less so now, admittedly. I can't recall any illnesses, any procedures… Honestly, it’s all rather… vague. My wife keeps track of those things. I simply do things. I don’t have a medical history. It’s a waste of time, really. Can we skip this?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can move on. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you're just grasping at straws, Doctor. My parents… they were Chinese, of course. They… worked hard. Simple people. They passed away some time ago. I don’t recall any… specific ailments they suffered. Perhaps they had the usual aches and pains of old age? I was too busy building things to pay much attention to their health. Honestly, it’s not something I’ve ever concerned myself with. Look, I’m a very private person. Can we please expedite this process? I assure you, I am perfectly fine. Just… tired. And a bit… dingy looking. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Drahota. Knowing that your parents were Chinese and you haven’t observed any specific health concerns in the family is helpful. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I believe in good, hard work and a healthy constitution. I don’t poison my body with those… concoctions. Supplements? Why would I need supplements? I eat… food. Simple, wholesome food. My wife might take something for her… joints, I believe. But I don't. I have never taken a medication in my life. Absolutely none. Now, is there anything else? I truly must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better picture of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at your skin. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I feel perfectly capable of assessing my own physical condition. I’ve built bridges, you understand! I know what a functioning body feels like. But… my wife would insist. She’s quite… insistent. Very well. Do what you must. But be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. And please, be gentle. My joints aren't what they used to be. This entire process is rather… undignified. Proceed, then. But swiftly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is steady. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a closer look at your skin. I see a generalized darkening of the skin, more pronounced on your hands and around your joints. It also feels a bit thicker than usual. Do you notice any itching, pain, or changes in texture?
PATIENT: Itching? No. Pain? Occasionally, a bit of stiffness in the mornings. But that’s to be expected, Doctor. Decades of hard labor. As for the texture… well, I haven’t exactly been examining my skin lately. I’ve been building things, not admiring my complexion. Honestly, I don’t notice much of a difference. It’s just… darker. As it has been for years. Look, is this examination complete? I’m growing impatient. And slightly uncomfortable. Can we please discuss the results? Or, better yet, can we simply conclude that I am perfectly healthy and I can return to my life?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand your discomfort. Based on the physical exam and what you've told me, I note generalized darkening and thickening of the skin, with some stiffness in the mornings. Given your age, history, and exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is a condition called hemochromatosis, which causes iron overload and can lead to skin darkening, fatigue, and joint pain. Another possibility is a pigmentary skin condition, and we also need to rule out other less common causes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us measure your iron levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Now you want to draw my blood? Doctor, are you serious? I haven't even so much as a scrape in decades and you want to poke and prod me? I told you, I've been building things! I don't have time for needles and laboratories and… and whatever else is involved in these “tests.” This is absurd. Absolutely absurd. Look, I appreciate your… diligence. But I think I've heard enough. This entire consultation has been a waste of time. A complete and utter waste of time. I’m leaving. And I suggest you don’t bother sending me a bill. I will not be paying it. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration and reluctance. However, I strongly recommend these blood tests to properly evaluate your condition. It’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. I can provide you with a referral to another physician if you’d prefer a second opinion. Perhaps another doctor can better address your concerns. In the meantime, I'll document our conversation and my findings. Please, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new concerns, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a good day, Mr. Drahota. .
