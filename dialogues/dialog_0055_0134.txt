DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see... well, things just haven't been right, you know? I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don't eat much. And I feel full so quickly... like after just a few bites. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's... worrying me some. I can't seem to keep much down, and I've lost a bit of weight, I think. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. "Not feeling right," nausea even with limited intake, early satiety, and some weight loss. You mentioned it’s been going on for “a little while.” Could you be more specific, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh dear... specific... That's hard. Let me think... it started... maybe around springtime? Or was it earlier? I've been spending a lot of time with my animals, training them, and things just sort of... blended together. It's been a few months, at least. I just thought it was a little indigestion at first, you know? Old age creeping up on me. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: "Old age creeping up," as you say. While that can contribute to changes, we want to rule out anything more concerning. You mentioned training your animals—do you have any dietary changes around that time, perhaps new treats or feeding schedules for them that may have affected your own routine?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question, Doctor. I have been trying out a new reward system with my border collie, Skye. She's a smart one, but a bit stubborn. I switched to these little salmon-flavored training bites... they're supposed to be extra motivating. And I suppose I was nibbling on a few of them myself, to see what she liked so much. It was just a couple, though! I don't eat a lot. But... could that be it? Maybe my stomach doesn't like salmon anymore? I hadn't thought about that.
DOCTOR: It's possible that a dietary change could be contributing. Though, we need to explore other possibilities as well. Now, Ms. Kelder, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the nausea and early satiety?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Hmm... Well, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more than usual. And my stomach… it doesn’t hurt exactly, but it feels… full of air, sometimes. Bloated, I guess. And… I’ve been a little constipated, if you don’t mind me saying. It's not a comfortable topic, but it’s the truth. I haven't been as regular as I used to be. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Kelder. Constipation, bloating, and fatigue are all relevant. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – specifically, the color or consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my... Doctor, you're asking a lot of personal questions! But I suppose it's your job. Let me think... it's been... darker, I think. Not black, but darker than usual. And… looser, sometimes. Not always, but when it is loose, it’s… well, not solid. I apologize for being so vague. It's all a bit of a blur, and I don't pay attention to such things unless something is terribly wrong. Is that bad? Is something terribly wrong?
DOCTOR: We're simply gathering information, Ms. Kelder. Changes in stool color and consistency can be indicative of various issues, and it’s important we investigate thoroughly. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or vomiting blood?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Blood? No, no, I don't think so. I would remember that, wouldn’t I? I haven’t seen any blood. And I haven’t been vomiting at all, not even a little. I just feel sick to my stomach, and then… nothing much happens. Just a bit of discomfort, and that bloated feeling. I'm getting a little worried now, Doctor. All these questions… it sounds serious, doesn't it? I just thought it was a little indigestion. Perhaps I should have come sooner.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve come in now. Given your symptoms – nausea, early satiety, weight loss, fatigue, bloating, constipation, and changes in stool consistency – we need to rule out several possibilities. I'm going to perform a physical examination now, Ms. Kelder. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you don't mind. We will start with abdominal palpation.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Palpation… that's pressing on your tummy, isn't it? Very well. I suppose it's necessary. Just… be gentle, Doctor. My insides are a bit sensitive these days. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, as you can tell. I trust you'll be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. Now, if you could lie on your back with your knees bent, that would be most helpful. I'll begin with auscultation, then palpation, and finally percussion. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable during the examination. I'm listening for bowel sounds now. They appear to be slightly diminished... which is not entirely unexpected, given your constipation. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes... A little, yes. Right… there. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Sort of a pressure. It's been like that for a while now, I suppose I just got used to it. Is that bad, Doctor? It doesn't feel like a muscle ache, it feels… deeper. It’s hard to explain. And it feels a little tender higher up too, around my belly button. Are you finding something?
DOCTOR: There's some mild tenderness in the epigastric region as well, as you’ve indicated. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. Tympanic throughout, consistent with bloating. Alright, Ms. Kelder, you can sit up now. Based on the physical exam, we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a comprehensive stool analysis to rule out infection. We will also need a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to get a clearer picture of what's going on. These tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh my... a CT scan? That sounds… serious. Contrast dye? I... I don’t think so. I haven't had many tests done in my life. I get a little nervous around doctors, to be honest. I’ve always been healthy, or at least, I thought I was. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? You’re saying a lot of scary words. And what exactly is a metabolic panel? I get so confused with all the medical terms. I just want to feel better. I miss training my animals.
DOCTOR: A CT scan simply provides a detailed image of your internal organs. It's a standard diagnostic procedure. A metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. It’s a routine blood test. As for allergies to contrast dye, it’s crucial to know as some individuals experience reactions. Have you ever had an imaging study done before, even an X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh… well, let me think… I had an X-ray on my shoulder once, years ago. I fell off a ladder while I was fixing the roof… it was a long time ago. And… that’s it, I think. No other tests, no other scans. I don't remember any reactions to the X-ray, but… I was younger then. And I don't think they used any dye. Does that mean I’m likely to be alright? And… what if something is wrong? What are we looking for, exactly? I feel so helpless.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, I understand your anxiety, but we need to remain calm and gather information. The X-ray doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about your current situation. We are investigating the cause of your nausea, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal discomfort. These symptoms could be indicative of a variety of issues – ranging from something relatively benign, such as irritable bowel syndrome, to something more serious, such as an obstruction or, less likely, a malignancy. The tests will help us differentiate between these possibilities. I will order the blood work and CT scan now. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. The CT scan will be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh… a malignancy? Cancer? You think I have cancer? No… no, that can't be. I… I don't understand. I've always been healthy. I eat my vegetables, I exercise with my animals… I don't… I don't know what to say. It's… it’s just a lot to take in. I think… I think I need a moment. And… what if it is cancer? What do I do then?
