DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re with Medicare, and we’re located in a rural setting… that’s good to know. Now, can you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, Medicare is… is the thing I have. And rural… well, everything is rural around here, isn’t it? I’m here… for a tryout. A physical, they said I needed. For… for the team. Baseball team. Old man’s league, you understand. Not like those… professional fellas. Just… a tryout. I think. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: A tryout. Right. And how long has it been since you last had a physical examination, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: A physical… hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t remember. A long time. Maybe… before the divorce? Yes, before. It was a stressful time, you see. A man doesn’t think about… check-ups when things are falling apart. Does that make sense? It was… a while ago. A long while.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. Life events can certainly take precedence. However, it’s important to establish a baseline now. To get a clearer picture of your current health status, I’m going to need to ask you some questions. It may seem thorough, but it’s for your own well-being. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Doctor, I work construction. Every ache and pain is a condition, you understand? My back, my knees… but those are just from work. Not… not a doctor’s condition. High blood pressure… maybe? My wife, she always said I worried too much. But she said a lot of things. I don’t think I have any serious conditions. I’ve been… reasonably healthy. I eat… food. And I sleep when I can. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… directness, Mr. Bartok, “reasonably healthy” isn’t quite enough for a medical assessment. We need specifics. Have you ever been told by a physician that you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other medical issue?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m a simple man. I don’t go to doctors unless something is broken. And nothing is broken. I’ve had a few bumps and bruises, pulled a muscle here and there, but no one has ever told me I have… what did you say? Diabetes? High blood… pressure? No. Never. I've always been strong. I don’t need a doctor telling me what’s wrong with me. I know what’s wrong with me. It's old age, that's all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, your self-assessment is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Even if you feel strong, underlying conditions can exist without presenting obvious symptoms. For the sake of this tryout, and more importantly, for your health, I need to proceed with a thorough examination. Now, let's move on to your surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Now that’s a good question. Let me think… My oldest son, he had his tonsils out when he was little. Does that count? No, that’s not me. I think… I think I had a mole removed once. A small one. On my back. A long time ago. Doctor said it was nothing, just to be safe. That's about it. I’ve been lucky, you see. Never needed much… cutting. I prefer to stay in one piece.
DOCTOR: A mole removal. Alright. And do you recall approximately when that was performed, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: When… oh, goodness. Doctor, you’re asking me to remember things from… a long time ago. Before… before everything. Let me see… My son, he was still in school. High school, maybe? So… twenty years ago? Perhaps more. It was… a long time. I’m not good with dates. I just know it was before the divorce, definitely. And it wasn't a big deal. Just a little snip. They sent it off to a lab. Everything was fine.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she lived to be ninety. A strong woman. But she didn’t trust doctors either. Always said they just wanted your money. She died in her sleep, peaceful like. My father… he worked in the fields his whole life. Tough as nails. He… he had a bad leg, always aching. But I don't know what it was. Some kind of arthritis, maybe? Cancer… I think my aunt had something. A long time ago. But we didn’t talk about it much. It was… unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, we didn’t pay much attention to these things. Just… lived our lives. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s… not particularly helpful, Mr. Bartok. Vague recollections are insufficient for a proper risk assessment. Let's try this differently. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – had heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, or any other serious medical condition?
PATIENT: Serious medical conditions… Doctor, are you trying to give me a bad day? I told you, my mother lived to ninety! She was strong. My father, he worked hard. They didn’t sit around complaining about every little ache and pain. My brother… he had a bad back. From lifting things, I think. And my sister… she worried a lot. Always going to the doctor for something or other. But that was her. I’m talking about serious things. Things that… kill you. I don’t remember any of that. We didn't dwell on death. It was just… life. Is this really necessary for a baseball tryout?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your reluctance to discuss these matters. However, this is absolutely necessary. A baseball tryout requires a certain level of physical fitness, and assessing your overall health is paramount. I am obligated to ensure your safety. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Now you're asking about that? Doctor, I work construction! Do you think I have time to sit around and… and recreate? I drink a beer now and then, with dinner. To relax, you understand? After a long day. And smoke? No. Never. Bad for the lungs. I need my lungs for… well, for working! And drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I don't need any of that nonsense. This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a physical, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bartok. Now, to complete the medical history, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I take something for my back, when it’s really bothering me. Something I got from the drugstore. Ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe naproxen? Something with an 'en' at the end. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something. Just to help me relax. A little pink pill. My ex-wife used to get them for me. But that’s it. Nothing serious. Just… little things. For aches and pains. And sleep. Is that what you need to know? Really, Doctor, I feel like I’m giving away all my secrets. It’s just a baseball tryout!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. To proceed, I need specific names and dosages of any medications you are taking. "Little pink pills" and "something with an 'en' at the end" are not sufficient. However, given the limited information you’ve provided, and frankly, your reluctance to cooperate fully, I’m going to proceed with a basic physical examination. Please sit back and relax. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to do, Doctor. But don't expect much. I'm an old man. Everything aches. And frankly, I still don't understand why I need all this for a baseball tryout. It's just a game. A little fun. Is that too much to ask? Little pink pills… I think it was Melatonin. Yes, that's it. Melatonin. For sleep. And the other one… Ibuprofen. When my back flares up. But it's nothing serious. Absolutely nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Deep breaths, please. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 98 beats per minute. Rhythm is regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s difficult to assess the significance without further testing. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but your breathing does sound slightly labored. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: 98? Labored? Doctor, I work construction! Of course my heart races and my breathing is… what did you say? Labored? I lift heavy things, I climb ladders, I spend all day in the sun! Of course I'm out of breath sometimes. A murmur? What’s that? Sounds serious. Is it bad? I told you, I'm an old man. Things are bound to be… worn out. I don't go around worrying about murmurs. Shortness of breath? Sometimes, after a long day. But that’s just from the work. It's normal. I think. Is this going to disqualify me from the tryout? I’ve been practicing. I’m still pretty good, you know. For an old man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, it's concerning that you dismiss these findings so readily. While I understand you are physically active, these symptoms – elevated heart rate, a heart murmur, and labored breathing – warrant further investigation. I’m not suggesting you are unfit for a baseball tryout at this moment, but it would be irresponsible of me to clear you without proper diagnostic testing. Blood pressure is elevated as well, 150/90. Again, this requires monitoring. I recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and a complete blood panel to check your overall health. I will also need a detailed list of any medications you have taken in the past six months, even over-the-counter remedies. I’m going to order these tests today. I strongly advise you to refrain from strenuous activity until we have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Electro… cardio… gram? Chest X-ray? Doctor, you're talking about a baseball tryout, not a heart attack! I just want to play a little baseball with my friends. I don’t need all these… tests! A complete blood panel? Six months? I can’t remember what I had for breakfast yesterday! And now you’re telling me I can’t play baseball? This is ridiculous! Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I'm a simple man. I don't need all these fancy tests. I’m fine. I’ve been working construction for thirty years. I’m tougher than I look. Just let me play baseball! Is that too much to ask? Really, what’s the worst that could happen? I might pull a muscle!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, your subjective assessment of your health is not sufficient. I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety, and I cannot in good conscience clear you for physical activity without further investigation. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. I understand your frustration, but this is not a matter of convenience. It is a matter of your well-being. I am ordering these tests, and I strongly recommend you schedule them as soon as possible. Until we have the results, I advise against any strenuous activity. I will have my nurse schedule these tests for you before you leave. If you refuse to cooperate, I will be unable to provide you with medical clearance for the baseball tryout. Do you understand?
