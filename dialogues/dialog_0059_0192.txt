DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Look, I ain't here for a chat. I need a check-up. Military wants it, see? Before they let me… well, let me join up. It’s August 2nd, right? Gotta be quick about it. Don't got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. A pre-employment physical for the military – certainly. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. We'll do our best to be thorough and keep things moving. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What kinda question is that? I work with engines. All day. Keeps me busy. I eat when I can, sleep when I can. Never been one for sittin' around complainin'. I ain't sick or nothin', that's for sure. Strong as an ox, I am. Used to be, anyway. Still alright, I reckon. What do you need to know exactly? You doctors always askin' these… vague things.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem broad, Mr. Hartness. We simply want to get a complete picture of your health history to ensure you're fit for service. It's standard procedure, and helps us identify any potential concerns. Let's try this. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never been one for hospitals. Waste of time, mostly. Got a scrape here and there from the engines, a pulled muscle now and again. Nothing a bit of rest didn't fix. Illnesses... I had the flu once, maybe twenty years ago. Bad one, it was. But I got over it. That's about it, really. I don't go around catchin' every little bug that flies by. Strong immune system, see? Keeps me goin'.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you generally stay healthy. And that you recovered well from the flu. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Why would I need surgery? I build things, I don't break things. Never been cut open. Never will be, hopefully. What kinda doctor asks a man if he's been cut open? Seems a bit… personal, don't you think? You sure you need all this information for the military? Seems like a waste of time to me. They just want strong backs, not perfect insides.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. The military has specific health requirements, and we need to rule out certain conditions to ensure your well-being and suitability for service. It’s not about finding imperfections, but about responsible assessment. Okay, let's move on. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What about 'em? My wife, mostly. She's fine. Keeps the house tidy. That’s about it. No kids. Never wanted 'em. Parents are… well, they're gone now. Both of 'em. Old age. Nothing exciting. What does my family have to do with me joining the military? Seems mighty strange, askin' about folks who aren’t even here. Are you gonna ask about my grandparents next? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. Family history can sometimes reveal predispositions to certain conditions that might not be immediately apparent. It helps us to have a broader understanding of your potential health risks. We won’t delve deeply unless something relevant arises, I assure you. For now, can you recall if anyone in your family – parents, grandparents, siblings – had any serious health problems like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Heart disease… my father, maybe? He wasn't a strong man. Always complainin' about his chest. Died young, he did. Diabetes… not that I recall. My mother was always a bit… frail, I suppose. But I wouldn't know what ailed her. Cancer… my aunt, I think. On my wife’s side, not mine. She got sick a long time ago. Look, I ain’t a doctor. I build engines. I remember engines. Not family illnesses. This is a waste of my time. Are we almost done? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing what you remember, Mr. Hartness. That's helpful. So, father with potential heart issues, mother frail, and wife’s aunt with cancer. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, just a few more questions, and then we’ll move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Never had one in my life. Eat anything, take anything. I’m a practical man. If it doesn’t kill me, I eat it. Dust gets me coughin' a bit, but that’s just from the workshop. Not an allergy. Honestly, this is gettin’ ridiculous. Are we actually gonna look at me now? Because if we are, let's get on with it. I haven't got all day, you know. My wife's makin’ stew. Don’t wanna miss that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, let’s proceed with the physical exam. I apologize for the seemingly endless questions, but it’s important to cover all the bases. To start, could you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Just tell me the number. I ain’t here for a conversation, remember? I got things to do. And don't you go makin' faces or nothin'. I know I ain't as skinny as I used to be. Buildin' engines is hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Your weight is 53 kilograms. And your height is 187 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Always been tall. Used to be an advantage. Now it just means I gotta duck under more things. Can we get on with it? I’m startin’ to feel like I’m at the doctor’s for nothin’. And I don’t do nothin’ for long. Let’s see, what's next? Blood pressure? Temperature? I'm ready when you are. Just… hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. This will just take a moment. Please relax your arm and keep it still. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, and your pulse is 72. Perfectly normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. I’m going to listen on your chest, is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do. Just don’t poke me with anything. I don't like bein' poked. Hurry it up, will ya? This is makin' me nervous. And I ain’t a nervous man. Used to workin’ with loud engines, remember? Not… this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Everything sounds normal there. Now, let’s take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears look good, and your throat is a little red, but nothing to be concerned about. It could just be from a bit of dryness.
PATIENT: Dryness? Probably. The workshop ain't exactly known for its humidity. Can we get this over with? Seriously, I’m losin’ patience. Is there anything else? Anything at all? Because if there isn't, I’d like to go. I got stew waitin’ for me. My wife makes a mean stew. You wouldn't wanna deprive me of that, would ya? Just tell me if I'm fit enough, or not. Don't need all the fancy details. Just… yes or no. Simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Based on this brief examination, there are no immediate red flags that would disqualify you. Your heart, lungs, ears, and throat are within normal limits. However, given your limited medical history and the requirements for military service, I strongly recommend a more comprehensive evaluation with blood work and possibly an EKG to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Comprehensive evaluation? Blood work? EKG? Now you’re just tryin’ to get more money outta me. Look, I told ya, I'm fine. Always have been. I build engines, remember? That's a tough job. Requires a strong body. I don’t need fancy tests. I need to know if I can join the military, or not. Yes or no. Are you gonna tell me, or what? This is ridiculous. My wife’s stew is probably gettin’ cold. I’m losin’ patience. Tell me now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your desire for a quick answer, and I respect your decision. However, I must reiterate that this has been a limited assessment. Based on this examination alone, and with the understanding that further evaluation is recommended, I can say that you do not have any immediately disqualifying conditions. However, this does not guarantee you will meet all of the military’s requirements. I strongly advise you to discuss these limitations with the military recruitment office. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So… I can try? I can go talk to ‘em? That’s all I needed to know. Look, I ain't lookin' for guarantees. I’m a strong man. I can handle myself. And if they don't want me, that’s their loss. Alright. I understand. Limited assessment. Talk to the recruitment office. Got it. Can I go now? Seriously. My wife's stew. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, you are free to go. Here's a summary of today's visit. Please be sure to share this with the recruitment office, and I strongly encourage you to follow up with a more comprehensive evaluation. I wish you the best of luck. .
