DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Sieh. It's very nice to meet you too. Well, I've been thinking lately... I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation. I was hoping to talk to you about it, see if it might be something that could help me. I work out on the tracks, you know, fixing signals and switches… it can be a bit stressful sometimes, and I’m looking for ways to… well, just feel a bit more peaceful, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you’re exploring ways to manage stress. Mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful tools, absolutely. It’s very common for demanding jobs to lead to stress, and proactively seeking solutions is excellent. To get a better understanding of how this might fit into your overall health, could you tell me a bit more about what specifically is stressful about your work on the tracks?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to begin? It's not one thing, really. It’s the responsibility, I suppose. Knowing that everything has to work perfectly, because… well, you know. And the hours can be unpredictable. Sometimes it’s hot, sometimes it’s cold, sometimes it’s just… a long day. And there's always a bit of pressure to get things done quickly, without making mistakes. It’s a good job, I enjoy the work itself, but it can leave me feeling… wired, even when I’m not working. Does that make sense? I remember one time, back in… oh, it must have been 2018… we had a terrible storm…
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. Responsibility, unpredictable hours, and pressure to perform – those are significant stressors. It’s understandable that would leave you feeling wired, even off-duty. And it sounds like you’ve experienced some truly challenging situations at work – a terrible storm would certainly add to that stress. Let’s focus on how you’re currently feeling. Aside from feeling “wired”, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I’ll lie in bed, and my mind just races. And I get headaches, not terrible headaches, but… frequent ones. And I think… maybe I’m a bit more irritable than I used to be. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrova, she mentioned it the other day, said I didn’t seem quite myself. I hadn’t really noticed, but… maybe she’s right. And… this is silly, but I forget things more easily now. Not important things, usually, just… where I put my keys, or what I was going to buy at the store. It's not like a serious memory problem, but it’s… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Those aren't silly at all, Ms. Sugino. Trouble sleeping, frequent headaches, irritability, and noticing some forgetfulness – those are all symptoms that can be related to stress and anxiety. It’s good that you’re paying attention to these changes. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I have Medicare, so I get my regular checkups. My blood pressure is usually a little high, but nothing the doctor worries about too much. He said to watch my salt intake, but… I’m not very good at that, I confess. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was a one-time thing, no problems since. And I don’t take any regular medications, besides an occasional pain reliever for a headache. Oh, and I had the flu shot last winter, of course. I try to be responsible about that. I don't have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, a bit of high blood pressure managed with diet, gallbladder removal ten years ago with no complications, occasional pain relievers as needed, and up-to-date on your flu shot. No known allergies. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health conditions that run in your family that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had some heart trouble later in life, and she was always a bit anxious, I remember. She worried about everything. And my father… he had diabetes, but that was later in life too, after he retired. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had some memory problems when she got older, but I don’t know if it was anything serious, like Alzheimer’s or anything. It was just… she started forgetting things, you know? Nothing major, but noticeable. It’s hard to say, really. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble and anxiety in your mother, diabetes in your father, and some memory issues in your grandmother. That gives us a little more to consider. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Never really appealed to me. And definitely no recreational drugs! I'm a very sensible person, I assure you. I do drink a lot of tea, though. Bulgarian herbal tea, mostly. It’s very good for you, my mother always said. And I try to eat healthy, but… I admit, I have a sweet tooth. I like a little chocolate now and then. And I walk when I can, but my job doesn’t leave me much time for exercise, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful – avoiding smoking and alcohol is excellent. And enjoying herbal tea and a little chocolate is perfectly fine – everything in moderation, as they say! Now, just to clarify, when you say your job doesn’t leave you much time for exercise, can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, it varies. Sometimes I'm working on the tracks themselves, replacing sections of rail or repairing the sleepers – the wooden beams under the tracks. That’s very physical work, lots of lifting and bending and walking. Other times I'm working on the signalling system, checking the electronics and making sure everything is functioning correctly. That’s more precise work, but still requires a lot of concentration and being on my feet. Usually, I start early, around 6:00 AM, and work a 10-hour shift. There’s a lot of driving involved, too, because the rail network is quite extensive. And sometimes we have to work nights or weekends, depending on the repairs that need to be done. It's not a glamorous job, but it’s important work, and I take pride in doing it well. And it's often very solitary. I work with a team, but there's a lot of time spent alone, concentrating on the task at hand.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very demanding job, both physically and mentally. The long hours, varied tasks, and periods of isolation can definitely contribute to stress. Now, just to get a complete picture, are there any major life stressors currently affecting you besides work?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, actually. I'm single, never married. I have some friends, but… most of them have families now, and we don’t see each other as much. I keep in touch with my sister, she lives in Sofia, but it’s mostly phone calls and emails. I don’t have any children, and… well, my parents are both gone now. So, no, not really any major life stressors besides work. It’s just… work seems to be taking more and more out of me lately. It's a bit lonely sometimes, I suppose, but I'm used to it.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like work is the primary source of stress right now, and that the lack of close social connections may be contributing to that feeling of loneliness. Now, before we discuss potential solutions, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and lungs, and I’ll listen to your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Sieh. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and try to take some deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not significantly different from what you've mentioned previously. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything sounds normal physically, Ms. Sugino. Given your symptoms – trouble sleeping, headaches, irritability, forgetfulness, and the stress from your job – and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I believe we’re dealing with stress-induced anxiety and possible mild hypertension. I want to rule out other causes, however. I would like to order some routine blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Dr. Sieh. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them done. I want to make sure we’re covering all the bases. I trust your expertise completely. So, blood work, you said? I suppose I'll need a form or something?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, blood work will give us a clearer picture. I'll have my assistant, Maria, come in and draw the samples. She will give you a form with instructions. It just requires a simple fasting blood draw, so please don't eat or drink anything for at least eight hours beforehand. In the meantime, let's discuss some strategies for managing your stress. Have you ever considered mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises?
PATIENT: That's what I was hoping to talk about with you, actually! I've been hearing a lot about mindfulness. I’ve never really tried it before, to be honest. I always thought it was a bit…new-age, perhaps. But I'm willing to try anything that might help. I'm just not sure where to begin. Is it something I can learn on my own, or would I need classes or something?
DOCTOR: That's a very common misconception, Ms. Sugino – that mindfulness is "new-age". It's actually a very ancient practice, rooted in Buddhist traditions, but it’s been adapted and secularized for modern use. And it’s incredibly effective for managing stress and anxiety. You absolutely can learn it on your own. There are many resources available – apps like Headspace and Calm are very popular, and there are countless guided meditations on YouTube. I can also provide you with some handouts and recommend a local mindfulness class if you'd prefer a more structured approach. The key is to start small. Even just five to ten minutes of daily practice can make a difference. It’s about focusing on your breath, paying attention to your senses, and gently redirecting your attention when your mind wanders. Would you be interested in trying some of the apps, or would you prefer I give you some handouts to begin with?
PATIENT: Handouts would be lovely, thank you. I think starting on my own might be easier, to be honest. I’m a bit… private, and I’m not sure I’d feel comfortable meditating in a group. Apps might be a bit too… public, if that makes sense. So, handouts would be perfect. And thank you for explaining it so clearly, Dr. Sieh. It doesn’t sound quite so daunting now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sugino. I understand completely. Privacy is important. Here are some handouts on basic mindfulness techniques, including a guided breathing exercise and some tips for dealing with intrusive thoughts. I’ve also included a list of local resources, in case you change your mind about the class. We’ll also get those blood tests done today, and I'll review the results with you next week. In the meantime, try to incorporate these mindfulness exercises into your daily routine, and see if they make a difference. We can also discuss medication if these techniques aren’t sufficient, but I prefer to start with non-pharmacological approaches whenever possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Dr. Sieh. You've explained everything very thoroughly, and I feel much more hopeful now. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking my concerns seriously. It’s a relief to finally be talking about this. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It’s my pleasure. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, and try to be kind to yourself.
PATIENT: .
