DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about my family, mostly. Lots of… trouble with heart things, you see. My mother, my brother… it makes me worry. I just want to be sure I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. Family history is very important. It's good you're being proactive. So, to clarify, you're coming in because of a family history of heart problems and you'd like a general check-up to assess your own risk?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A check-up. See if I need to… worry. I don’t feel bad now, but… you know. Better safe than sorry. My brother, he didn’t… he didn’t know anything was wrong until it was too late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's a very sensible approach. We'll do some tests and get a good picture of what's going on. Now, can you tell me a bit more about your brother and mother?
PATIENT: My mother… she had a bad heart for a long time. Lots of medicine. She was in the hospital a lot when she was older. She… she passed away maybe ten years ago now. My brother… he was younger. Only 58. He just… collapsed. They said it was his heart. A… a bad valve, I think they said. It was quick. Very quick.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your mother had long-standing heart disease, and your brother had a more sudden event, potentially related to a valve issue. And you said your brother was 58… Do you recall if he had any symptoms before collapsing – chest pain, shortness of breath, anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. He didn’t say anything. He was always busy, you know? Working, fixing things. He didn’t complain much. Everyone said he was… strong. That’s why it was such a shock. I don’t think he even felt bad before. He just… went down. It was… scary.
DOCTOR: That is concerning. Alright. And how about you, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Me? Uh… I feel okay. Really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I’m 73, you know? That’s probably just getting old. I walk a bit, I try to eat good. No chest pain or anything like that. I don’t smoke, never did. And I don’t drink much, just a beer with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good, that's all helpful information. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life, to be honest. Maybe some aspirin when I have a headache, but that’s about it. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… trying to stay healthy. I take a walk every day, eat my vegetables… that’s about it. No pills, no vitamins, nothing like that. I don’t really believe in all that stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… what now? You mean… friends? I don’t see many people these days. I’m divorced, been divorced a long time. I have a son, but he lives far away. I mostly keep to myself. Not much socializing, I guess. I used to… but not anymore. It's just me, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Keeping to yourself is perfectly fine. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just want to make sure I’m okay. My son worries about me too, you know. He says I should get checked up. So, whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just hop up on the table here, we'll get started. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Hmm... I hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but it’s present. I’ll need to document that. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulses are good and strong. No swelling in your legs. Overall, you seem to be in fairly good shape, but that murmur and the blood pressure warrant a bit more investigation. I’d like to order an EKG and some basic blood work. And perhaps an echocardiogram to get a better look at your heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: E… K… G? Echo… what? That sounds… complicated. Is it… serious? What will those tests show? I just want to know if my heart is okay, Doctor. I don’t want a lot of… fancy tests if it’s nothing. Is the murmur… bad? It sounds like a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It does sound like a lot, I apologize. An EKG is a simple, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us detect any irregular rhythms or signs of previous heart attacks. The echocardiogram is an ultrasound of your heart – it uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart chambers and valves. It will show us the structure of your heart and how well it's functioning. The murmur I hear is a sound made by the blood flowing through your heart. Murmurs aren’t always serious – many people have them and live perfectly normal lives. But because of your family history, and the fact that it’s present, it’s important to investigate further to rule out anything concerning. It is simply a precaution. These tests will help us determine the cause of the murmur and assess your overall heart health. Would you like me to explain anything in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. A picture of my heart. That doesn’t sound too bad. And it's just to be safe, you said? Because of my brother and mother? I guess… I guess that makes sense. So, you want to take a picture and see if it's like theirs? Will it… will it hurt? And how long does it take? I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s just to be safe, because of your family history. The echocardiogram is completely painless. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and move a probe around to create the image. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the blood work, that will be a quick draw, and the results usually take a couple of days. The EKG is very fast, just a few minutes. We'll start with the EKG and blood work today, and schedule the echocardiogram for next week. That will give us the most information. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Thirty minutes… I can handle thirty minutes. And a quick blood draw. Next week… alright. Yes, that sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And you’ll tell me what it means, right? What the pictures show? I don’t want a lot of… medical words. Just… is my heart okay or not?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. I promise to explain everything in plain language, no medical jargon. We'll go over the results together, and I’ll answer all your questions. We'll focus on what they mean for you, and whether your heart is healthy or if we need to take any further steps. I'll make sure you understand everything before we move forward. Now, let's get the EKG done first. Nurse Johnson will be in shortly to get you set up. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining it all. And for not making me feel… scared. I was very worried. I hope it’s nothing. I really do. Just… hope it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I understand your worry, and we’ll do everything we can to get you answers. Try not to stress too much before we have the results. Nurse Johnson will be right in. If anything comes to mind before she arrives, please don’t hesitate to ask.
