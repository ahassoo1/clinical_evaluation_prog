DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is it okay if I call you Doctor Gegan? It is very nice to meet you too. I am here for this… telehealth thing. My… my daughter, she made the appointment for me. I do not always understand these new things.
DOCTOR: Please, call me Doctor Gegan. Absolutely. And don’t worry at all about the telehealth – it’s new for a lot of people. Your daughter was very thoughtful to get you set up. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on that prompted you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Well… it is my back. It has been… bothering me. Not all the time, but… when I bend, or if I lift something, it hurts. It is a dull ache, mostly. I used to be able to do so much more in the garden, but now… it is difficult. It is not a sharp pain, you understand? More… a tiredness in the back. I work with cars, you know. Maybe that has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your back, that worsens with bending or lifting. It’s impacting your gardening, and you think your work with cars might be contributing. That’s helpful information. And just to clarify, when did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… after the winter, I believe. Maybe… March? Yes, around March. It started slowly, and I thought it would go away on its own. But it has not. It is… still there. Not worse, exactly, but… not better either. I am not a young woman anymore, you know. Things do not always fix themselves like they used to.
DOCTOR: That's fair. It started around March, hasn’t improved on its own, and you've noticed it’s been persistent. And you work with cars, so it's reasonable to consider that might be playing a role. Can you tell me a little more about the type of work you do with cars?
PATIENT: I am a mechanic. I have been one for… a long time. I fix the engines, the brakes… everything, really. I lift heavy parts, I bend under the cars… It is physical work. I try to be careful, but… sometimes you have to force things. I have a small shop, it is not a big place. Just me and one helper now. My husband… he used to help, but he is gone now. It is harder to do it all alone.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Being a mechanic is physically demanding, and I understand it’s been harder since your husband passed away. Now, thinking about the pain itself – does it radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean… does it go somewhere else? Hmm… Sometimes, yes. It feels like it goes down into my… my hips a little bit. Not all the way to my legs, just… in the hips. And sometimes, I feel it in my… lower stomach. But not always. It depends on how much I have been moving, I think. When I sit for too long, it feels worse. Standing is better, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain radiates to your hips and sometimes your lower stomach, and it seems to be worse when you're sitting for long periods. That's helpful. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain on average?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. That is… a difficult question. On a good day, when I have not been working too much, maybe a… two? Three? But when I have been lifting things, or bending a lot… it can go up to… six, maybe? Sometimes seven. But not often. It is usually somewhere in between. It is not a constant pain, you understand? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. So it fluctuates, averaging around a 2-3, but can go up to a 6 or 7 with activity. Do you notice anything specifically that makes it better or worse besides sitting and activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Warmth helps. A warm bath, or a heating pad on my back… that feels good. And… when I take my time. If I rush things, it hurts more. If I try to be quick, it is worse. Also… if I am tired. When I do not sleep well, it is much, much worse. I do not sleep as well as I used to. It is harder to get comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, warmth, taking your time, and good sleep seem to help. And fatigue makes it worse. Now, have you tried any medications, creams, or anything else for the pain?
PATIENT: I have… I have taken some of those over-the-counter pain pills. The white ones… I forget the name. They help a little bit, but not much. And my daughter, she gave me some cream once, with the menthol smell. It felt nice, but it did not really take the pain away. I do not like taking too many pills, you know. They make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’ve tried some over-the-counter pain pills and a menthol cream, with limited relief. You prefer not to take a lot of pills, and that’s perfectly reasonable. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have Medicare, so I have seen doctors. My blood pressure… it sometimes goes up, the doctor told me. She gave me pills for that too. I take those every day. And… I had some problems with my cholesterol, but they said it is okay now. I used to be heavier, but I lost some weight. I do not have diabetes, I do not think. I have never been told I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication, and you previously had some cholesterol issues that are now under control. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious injuries?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was a teenager. But nothing else, I do not think. No serious injuries. I have always been careful, you know. Working with cars, you have to be. Otherwise… it can be dangerous.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a wrist fracture. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have problems with their back, arthritis, or similar conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had bad arthritis in her hands. Very bad. She could not move them very well when she got older. And my husband, he had some problems with his back too. He used to lift a lot of heavy things at work. He did not go to the doctor much, though. He said it was just part of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and back problems. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoked. And… I do not drink much alcohol. Maybe a small glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. But not every day. And… no, no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I am a simple woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Benites. That gives me a really good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll need you to stand up, if you're able, and I'll check your range of motion and feel your back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. I can stand up. It might be a little… slow, but I can do it. Just tell me what to do. And… be gentle, please. It is a little sore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, can you just bend forward at the waist and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. That is… difficult. It hurts a little bit when I bend that far. It is… not a sharp pain, but a stretching, aching feeling. I cannot touch my toes anymore. I used to be able to, but… not now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, and discomfort with forward bending. That's helpful. Now, can you bend backward a little bit?
PATIENT: That is… better than bending forward. But still… it is not comfortable. I feel it in my lower back when I do that. It is a pulling sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion and discomfort with backward bending as well. Now, I'm going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that is… tender. It hurts when you press there. It is a dull ache, but it is definitely sore. It feels like… a knot, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness noted on the right side of your lower back, with a possible knot. And now, I'm going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs, just to make sure there's no nerve involvement. This will just involve a quick tap with a small hammer. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. A hammer? That sounds… a little scary, but if you think it is necessary… go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My legs are not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Sensation is intact. Okay, Ms. Benites, that concludes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by your work and perhaps some deconditioning. The tenderness on the right side suggests the strain is localized there. It's good that your reflexes and sensation are normal, which makes nerve involvement less likely. However… given your age and the persistent nature of the pain, I’d like to order some x-rays of your lower back just to rule out any other issues, like arthritis or fractures. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh dear. I do not like those. But… if you think it is necessary, I suppose so. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I worry about radiation. Is it much? But… if it will help find out what is wrong, then yes. Please do what you think is best.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about radiation. The amount of radiation from a lower back x-ray is quite low, and the benefits of ruling out other issues outweigh the risks in this case. We'll use the lowest possible dose. I’m also going to recommend a course of physical therapy. A therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your posture, and reduce your pain. And I’ll prescribe a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help with the pain and inflammation in the short term. Here's the plan: We’ll get the x-rays scheduled today. I’ll write you a prescription for the medications, and I’ll give you a referral to a physical therapy clinic nearby. I want you to start the physical therapy as soon as possible. And please, try to avoid heavy lifting and bending as much as possible until your pain subsides. Do you have any questions about the plan?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds good. I always liked the idea of exercises, but I never knew what to do. And… a prescription for pills, that is helpful. I hope they do not make me too sleepy. Just… the physical therapy… will it be expensive? I worry about the cost. And… is there anything I can do at home, besides avoid lifting? Like… a warm bath? Or… a heating pad?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions. The cost of physical therapy can vary depending on your insurance coverage and the clinic. I'll have the referral coordinator contact your insurance to get an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs before you schedule your first appointment. They can also discuss any financial assistance options that may be available. And yes! Absolutely. A warm bath or a heating pad on your lower back can be very helpful for relieving pain and muscle spasms. You can apply heat for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Gentle stretching is also good, as long as it doesn't cause pain. I’ll have the physical therapist show you some safe and effective stretches. Avoid any movements that worsen your pain. I’ll also write down some basic instructions for you, including the medication dosages and when to follow up with me. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I feel… a little better now, just knowing what is going on. And I appreciate you writing down the instructions. My memory is not what it used to be. Please, just let me know when the x-rays are scheduled, and I will come in. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. My pleasure. The referral coordinator will contact you within the next few business days to schedule your x-rays. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Here are the written instructions, as promised. I'll also have a nurse stop by before you leave to review everything with you. Get some rest, and remember to take it easy. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Benites. I hope you feel better soon.
