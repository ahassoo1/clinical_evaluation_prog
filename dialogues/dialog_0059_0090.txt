DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, I’m here for a clearance, I believe? For… a surgery. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. My husband handled most of the arrangements. He… passed away recently, and I’m still getting things sorted. It’s for cosmetic surgery, I think? I just need to be sure I’m healthy enough to go through with it.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry for your loss, Ms. Brightful. That must be incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly understandable that details might be a bit unclear right now. We'll take things at your pace. So, a pre-operative clearance for cosmetic surgery. That's a good starting point. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me what type of cosmetic surgery you’re scheduled for, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It is difficult. You know… I really wish I could tell you. It was… something I’d always wanted, and he was so supportive. But he did all the research and booked everything. I just… said yes. I think it had to do with… my stomach? And maybe my arms? I’m so sorry, this is terribly unhelpful. It was a consultation with the surgeon a few months back, and he explained everything, but… it hasn’t stuck with me. It wasn’t a major thing, he assured me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. Don’t apologize at all. It’s completely understandable given everything you've been through. We can certainly work with what you do remember, and I can review the surgical notes if you’d like. Do you happen to remember the name of the surgeon or the facility where the surgery is scheduled?
PATIENT: Hmm… the surgeon… I think his name was… Dr. Alvarez? Yes, that sounds right. Dr. Alvarez. He had a very nice office, very modern. And the facility… it was near the mall, I believe. The big one on Ocean Boulevard? It wasn't a hospital, more like a… a specialized clinic, perhaps? It had a lovely waiting room, I remember that. Lots of plants. I apologize again, I’m afraid my memory is quite… patchy.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. You’re doing just fine. Let me see… yes, here we are. Dr. Ricardo Alvarez, specializing in plastic surgery, and his clinic is indeed near Ocean Boulevard. It appears you have an appointment scheduled for a tummy tuck and arm lift on August 15th. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, that is right! A tummy tuck and… an arm lift. That’s what it was. Thank you, Doctor, you’re a lifesaver. I was beginning to think I’d imagined the whole thing. August 15th… that’s soon. So, that’s what this is for? Making sure I’m healthy enough for all that?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Brightful. That’s precisely what this pre-operative clearance is for – to ensure you are in the best possible health to undergo the surgery safely and have a smooth recovery. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, could you please tell me about any medical conditions you have – for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I don’t think I have anything major. My husband always took care of the doctor’s appointments and things like that. He said my blood pressure was a little high once, but it went down with diet and exercise. And… oh! I have allergies. Pollen, mostly. Makes me sneeze a lot in the spring. But other than that… I haven’t really been sick in years. I try to eat healthy and stay active, but… it’s hard sometimes. I suppose I should have paid more attention to all this.
DOCTOR: It’s very common to rely on a partner for these things, Ms. Brightful, and there's absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. It sounds like you generally take good care of yourself, which is excellent. Knowing your allergy history is helpful. Just to clarify, when you say your blood pressure was a little high, do you recall if you were ever prescribed any medication for it?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. My husband said it was just borderline, and that watching my diet and getting more exercise would be enough. He made me a special meal plan, lots of fruits and vegetables. He was very… thorough. I’m almost positive I never took any pills for it. It was a few years ago, maybe four or five? And it went back to normal pretty quickly, he said. He always said I was generally very healthy, just a bit… stressed sometimes. Which I suppose is understandable.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Brightful. So, no current medications for blood pressure or any other conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills, vitamins, or anything like that. Just… try to eat well and get some fresh air when I can. I do drink a lot of water, though! He always made sure I had a water bottle with me. It’s a good habit, I think. I suppose I should start taking better note of these things, though. It’s just… it was always easier to let him handle it.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable, Ms. Brightful. It sounds like he was very attentive to your well-being. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a child, I remember that. A silly accident, climbing a tree. And… oh! I had my tonsils out when I was little too. That was… unpleasant. But other than that… no, I don’t think so. No major surgeries, no hospital stays as an adult. Just the usual childhood things. I’m pretty sure. I would remember something big, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You would, Ms. Brightful. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… tricky. My family is… complicated. I grew up in Colombia, and we didn’t really talk about medical history much. It wasn’t common, I suppose. My mother… she passed away when I was young. And my father… he wasn't very involved. I know my grandmother had… arthritis, I think? And my uncle had diabetes, but that’s about all I know. I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… not something I have much information about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially if you weren't closely connected or if it wasn't a common practice in your family. We can proceed without it, though it is helpful if you ever happen to recall anything further. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I always thought those things were very unhealthy. My husband felt the same way. We both believed in taking care of our bodies.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Brightful. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… just pollen, like I mentioned before. That’s the only thing I know of, really. It makes me sneeze a lot and my eyes get itchy in the spring. But I don’t have any allergies to food or medications. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My husband always double-checked everything when I was sick, just to be safe. I suppose he was a bit of a worrier. But it was a good kind of worrying.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Brightful, that gives me a good overview of your health. It sounds like you are generally in good health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to confirm everything and get a baseline reading. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to be sure I’m healthy enough for this surgery. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular. Throat appears clear, no signs of infection. No edema noted in extremities. Everything looks good so far, Ms. Brightful. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes bilaterally. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength in both hands. Now, let’s check your legs. Could you please extend one leg at a time?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I’m a little stiff, if I’m honest. I haven’t been very active lately.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Brightful. A little stiffness is common. Everything appears normal here as well. Okay, Ms. Brightful, based on my exam, you appear to be in good overall health and are a suitable candidate for surgery. However, to be completely thorough, I would like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will give us a more detailed look at your blood work and ensure there are no underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely! Whatever you think is best. I want to be as prepared as possible, and I trust your judgment completely. Blood work sounds perfectly fine. When can I get that done? And will I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send an order to the lab here at the clinic. You can go anytime tomorrow morning, no appointment necessary. The results should be back within 24-48 hours. Once I have those results, I’ll review them and give you a call to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I feel much better now. I was just so worried about whether I was healthy enough, and you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you so much for taking the time to see me and answer all my questions. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It was my pleasure. Remember, if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns before your surgery, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll be in touch once your lab results are back. In the meantime, please try to get some rest and take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Brightful. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day to you too. .
