DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That’s why I’m here. I work with fences, and… well, it hurts to do that work now. I’d like to get this sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain is certainly not ideal, especially when it interferes with work. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: Where does it hurt, exactly? And… what kind of pain is it? Is it a sharp pain, or more of a dull ache? I… I don’t really know medical words, if that makes sense. It just hurts. Mostly in my back, but sometimes in my shoulders too. When I lift things, it’s the worst.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense; you don’t need to know medical words! Just describe it as best as you can. So, primarily in your back, and sometimes radiating to your shoulders. And it's worse with lifting. Is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly goes when I’m resting. But… lifting even a small post can bring it right back. It’s not a burning pain. More like… a heavy ache, and sometimes a sharp stab if I move wrong. I don’t know if that helps. It’s been getting worse for… maybe three months now.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Reihner. So, it's an aching pain, with occasional sharp stabs, primarily in your back radiating to your shoulders, and it's been progressively worsening over the past three months, aggravated by lifting. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And my legs feel fine. My hands… sometimes they feel a little clumsy after a long day, but I thought that was just from working with the wire and tools. Nothing I couldn't work through. I haven't fallen or had any… big accidents, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No numbness or weakness, and no history of trauma. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain so far – over-the-counter medications, heat, ice, anything like that?
PATIENT: I’ve taken some of those… pain pills. The kind you can buy at the store. Didn’t really do much, to be honest. And my mother always said heat was good for aches, so I’ve tried a warm compress a few times. That helps for a little while, but it always comes back. I mostly just try to… work through it, but it’s getting harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. Over-the-counter pain medication and heat with limited relief. Let’s move on to some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctor back home… he always said I was healthy, just strong. I have Medicare, so they check me up regularly. Nothing ever came up. I’m a widow, you see. My husband… he took care of most of the paperwork and doctor visits when we were married. I don’t have much experience with all that, honestly. But no, nothing they’ve ever told me about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No known medical conditions. And thank you for sharing that; it’s helpful to understand your history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Broken a bone or two as a child, but nothing that needed… cutting. Mostly just sprains and bruises from work. This back pain is different, though. It’s not like anything I’ve felt before. It’s… deeper.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. And you're right, a deep ache is often different from a simple sprain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years for colds and headaches. Nothing ever reacted badly. I don’t take any regular medication, just those pain pills when my back hurts. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no regular medications. Let's talk a little about your family history, if you're comfortable. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had problems with their back or joints?
PATIENT: My mother… she had arthritis in her hands when she got older. But she was very old, you see. And she didn't work like I do. My father… he was a strong man, always working. I don’t recall him ever complaining about his back. No one else that I can think of. It just… started with me. I'm not sure if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Family history of arthritis is worth noting. Finally, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: I erect fences. Mostly for farms and ranches around here. Lots of lifting, digging post holes, stretching wire… it’s hard work. I’ve been doing it for… oh, fifteen years now, since my husband passed. I needed something to keep me busy, and I was always good with my hands. But it’s getting harder and harder to do. I don’t know how much longer I can keep it up. That’s why I came in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve been doing physically demanding fence work for fifteen years. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s causing this pain. I’d like to get back to work, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could stand for me, please. I just want to see how you move. And then we'll move onto some gentle range of motion tests and palpation. Okay, so I’m observing some slight forward rounding of your shoulders and a little bit of asymmetry in your hips. Now, could you bend forward slowly and touch your toes, or as close as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not so good. It hurts right in my lower back. I can’t reach my toes, not anymore. And it feels… tight. Like something is pulling. It’s worse when I bend forward like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. Limited range of motion with forward flexion and discomfort noted in the lumbar region. Now, let's try bending backward slowly. Again, just go as far as you comfortably can. And I’ll just gently palpate your spine and surrounding muscles while you're moving, to check for tenderness or spasms.
PATIENT: That’s… better, but still uncomfortable. There’s a sharp pain right on the side of my back, near my shoulder blade. It feels like… a knot. And yes, that's tender! Right there. Don’t push too hard, Doctor. It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting some significant muscle spasms and tenderness in the paraspinal muscles on the right side, near the shoulder blade. And you're right, it’s quite tender to the touch. Now, let’s check your reflexes. If you could sit on the examination table, please. I'll use a small hammer to tap your knees. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax my legs… This always makes me nervous. I never liked doctors poking at me. Just… try to be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Reihner. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your reflexes are normal bilaterally. That's good. And finally, let's just do a quick straight leg raise test. If you could lie on your back, please. I’m going to lift your leg straight up in the air, just to see if that causes any pain.
PATIENT: Alright. Straight leg raise… Oh… that’s… okay. Not too bad. No sharp pain. Just a little bit of stretching. It doesn’t feel like the back pain, if that makes sense. It's more in my hip.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain radiating down the leg with the straight leg raise, but some discomfort in the hip. Okay, Ms. Reihner, that completes the physical exam for now. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, it appears you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by your work. There's also some tenderness in the paraspinal muscles. The hip discomfort could be related, or it could be a separate issue. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but I don’t suspect anything serious at this time. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: So… it's just a strain? From lifting? I don't understand… what does that mean? And what do we do about it? Can I still work? I need to know. I have bills to pay. Will I need… medicine? Or something more? I'm not a fan of all those tests, if we can avoid them.
DOCTOR: Okay, those are all very good questions, Ms. Reihner. A muscle strain means you've overstretched or torn a muscle in your back. It’s a common injury, especially with physically demanding work like yours. It’s like stretching a rubber band too far - it can get damaged. As for what we do about it, the good news is that most muscle strains heal with conservative treatment. That means things like rest, ice, heat, and pain medication. I'm going to recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, which will help reduce inflammation and pain. I also recommend applying ice to your back for the first 24-48 hours, then switching to heat after that. As for whether you can still work, that’s a little tricky. I recommend avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous activity for the next week or two. We need to give the muscle a chance to heal. You might be able to do some light work, but you need to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. I don't think we need to do any tests at this time, like an X-ray or MRI, unless your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they get worse. I'd like to see you back in a week to re-evaluate. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a little more sense. Rest, ice, heat, and those pain pills. No heavy lifting. A week. Okay. And what if it doesn’t get better in a week? Then you’ll do those tests? I’m just worried about losing my job. I don’t have a lot of savings. And… is there anything else I can do? Like… exercises? Or stretches? Something to help it heal faster? I don't want this to drag on for months.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Reihner. And yes, if your symptoms don’t improve after a week, we can discuss further imaging, like an X-ray, to rule out any other underlying issues. We would also consider a referral to a physical therapist at that point. And yes, there are definitely things you can do to help it heal faster. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercises can help improve your flexibility and strength, and prevent it from getting worse. However, it’s important to start slowly and listen to your body. I can give you a handout with some simple exercises you can do at home. Things like gentle back extensions, knee-to-chest stretches, and pelvic tilts. We need to be careful not to aggravate the injury. I also recommend maintaining good posture and lifting techniques. When you do lift something, bend at your knees, keep your back straight, and hold the object close to your body. I want to reassure you that most muscle strains heal with conservative treatment. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and if it doesn’t improve, we’ll explore other options. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all for now. The exercises handout sounds good. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s… reassuring. I’ll try to rest and take it easy, and I’ll come back in a week. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I’m glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'll see you back in a week. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
