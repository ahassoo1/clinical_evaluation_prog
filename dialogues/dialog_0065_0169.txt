DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Minerd. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it’s… my face and legs, mostly. They’re puffin’ up, see? Like a balloon, almost. Been happenin’ for… a while now, I reckon. Don’t rightly know when it started, though. Things kinda blur together these days.
DOCTOR: "Puffin’ up," you say. Okay. And is this swelling… consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Consistent… mostly. Gets worse some days, better others, but it's always there, really. Not like it just pops up outta nowhere. It’s just… noticeable. Especially in the mornin’. Makes my boots feel kinda tight, ya know? And my wife… well, she always said my face looked rounder when it was bad. She had a good eye for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I see. And would you describe any other symptoms along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Might be a little more tired than usual, but I'm an old man, ain't I? What’s that even mean? Tired. I dunno. Things just feel… heavy, sometimes. My hands ache a bit when I'm workin’, but that’s just the welding, I figure. Been doin’ that for forty years, ya know. Builds up. Mostly just the puffiness, though. That’s the main thing botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Forty years of welding… that is significant. Okay. Let’s try to get a more precise timeline. When you say “a while now,” are we talking weeks, months, or longer than a year?
PATIENT: A year… maybe more? Honestly, Doc, time slips by. Since… well, since Martha passed, everything kinda blurred together. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was over a year. It definitely wasn't just a few weeks. More like… a slow creep, ya know? Started subtle and just got worse. I don’t pay much attention to dates, never have. Important dates were always Martha's thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. A slow progression… and you haven’t noticed any specific triggers that make it worse?
PATIENT: Triggers? No. Not really. I eat what I always eat - meat and potatoes, mostly. Maybe a little too much salt, sometimes, but who doesn’t? I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not since… well. I don't go travelin' or nothin'. Just work, come home, watch a bit of TV. I wouldn't know what a 'trigger' even is, to be honest. Is that somethin' you eat?
DOCTOR: A trigger is simply something that makes the swelling worse, Mr. Minerd. It could be a food, an activity… anything. Let’s move on to other medical issues. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the Doc mentioned somethin’ a few years back. Said I should watch the salt. But I didn't really feel sick, so I didn’t bother with pills. Never been one for takin' medicine unless I absolutely have to. Diabetes? No, not that I know of. Martha did her best to keep me eatin’ right, but I always liked a bit of sweet somethin’ after dinner. Heart problems… no, I don't think so. I can still climb the stairs, ya know. Slowly, but I can do it. Mostly just… old man aches and pains. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I reckon. And a few broken bones when I was younger, workin' on the farm. Nothing serious, though. Healed up fine. Hospitalized… not really. Maybe a night or two for the flu, but nothin' that required anythin' fancy. I think Martha took me in once when I had a bad cough, but I don't remember much about it. She handled all the doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Martha’s mother had somethin’ with her heart, I think. Died young, she did. And her father… he had a bad cough for years. Ended up bein’ somethin’ with his lungs, I believe. My own parents… they both just… faded away, ya know? Old age. No real sicknesses, not that I recall. They lived on a farm, just like me. Healthy livin’, mostly. Not much for doctors, either. Tough stock, my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been one for pills, Doc. Always figured fresh air and hard work were better medicine. And Martha... she always said too many pills just make you feel worse. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. Vitamins... no. Supplements... no. Just good, honest food and a bit of rest. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Minerd. Now, before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I'm aware of. I've eaten everything put in front of me, practically. And I’ve been stung by bees a few times, workin’ on the farm, but I didn’t swell up or nothin’. Just a bit of a sting, that’s all. Martha always said I had a strong constitution. She was right about most things, that woman. No allergies, Doc. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks, and I'll be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your legs and abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Seems like a lot of fuss over a bit of puffiness, but if you gotta poke and prod, go ahead. Just be gentle, ya hear? Old bones ain’t what they used to be. It's just... I don't like bein' fussed over. Makes me feel like a child. But if it gets me home quicker, I reckon I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, let's check your blood pressure. 160 over 95. Elevated. Heart sounds are normal, though slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but with mild distension. Significant pitting edema bilaterally, extending up to the mid-calf. Palpation reveals warmth and tenderness. The edema is concerning, Mr. Minerd. And your blood pressure is elevated.
PATIENT: Edema… is that bad? They do feel kinda tight, now that ya mention it. And my boots have been feelin' a bit snug. Elevated blood pressure… that don't sound good, does it? Martha always said I should watch the salt, but I never paid much attention. So what does it mean, Doc? Am I… sick? Is it somethin' serious? I just want to get back home, ya know? This fussin' is makin' me anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Minerd, your symptoms – the persistent swelling, the elevated blood pressure – are suggestive of several possibilities. It could be related to underlying heart or kidney issues, or even liver disease. It could also be a sign of venous insufficiency. I need to order some laboratory tests – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis – to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll also need to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I am also going to order a lower extremity ultrasound to evaluate the veins in your legs and rule out any blood clots. I’m also concerned about your history of untreated hypertension. That needs to be addressed. I'll likely need to prescribe medication to control your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Medication… I told ya, Doc, I don't like pills. Never have. And all these… tests? An EKG? Ultrasound? What's the point of pokin' and proddin' if it just leads to more pokin' and proddin'? Is it somethin' serious? Will I be alright? I just want to get back to my routine, ya know? Can’t we just… try somethin' else? Maybe cut back on the salt? Or take a walk? I don't want to be hooked on pills for the rest of my life. What’s wrong with just… livin’ my life?
DOCTOR: Mr. Minerd, I understand your reluctance, but these tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Ignoring them will not make them go away, and could lead to serious complications – heart attack, stroke, kidney failure. While reducing salt intake and increasing exercise are certainly beneficial, they are not enough to address potentially serious underlying medical conditions. I'm not saying you will need to be on medication for life, but we need to get a diagnosis first. And that requires these tests. I will write the orders for the lab work, EKG, and ultrasound. The lab and EKG can be done today. We’ll schedule the ultrasound for later this week. I strongly advise you to follow through with these tests. Your health is at stake. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Understand… yeah, I understand. You want to poke and prod and run tests and give me pills. Fine. Do what you gotta do. But I ain’t promisin’ I’ll take any pills. And I ain't promisin' I'll be happy about it. Just… get it over with, Doc. The sooner you poke and prod, the sooner I can go home. Martha woulda handled this different. She always knew what to say… and she didn’t like pills either.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood for the lab work and perform the EKG. I’ll have her schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. I understand your concerns, Mr. Minerd, and I assure you, I will explain all the results to you thoroughly and discuss the best course of action. We’ll work together to manage your health. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Not right now. Just… get it over with, Doc. I reckon I just need to get home. Thank you… I think. .
