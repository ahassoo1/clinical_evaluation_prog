DOCTOR: Right, yes. Well, Mrs. Durig, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s turned quite yellow, you see. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but my daughter, bless her heart, insisted I come. Something about my… liver? I have had some trouble with that, I believe. Years ago. It’s all a bit hazy, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Liver trouble… years ago. Right. And you said yellowing of the skin?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. It's… noticeable, isn't it? I haven't been feeling terribly sick, just… tired, perhaps. A bit more than usual. And the colour… it worries my daughter terribly. She says it's something called… jaundice? Is that right? I truly don't keep up with these things anymore.
DOCTOR: Jaundice, yes, that’s what your daughter likely means. It can be a sign of liver issues. Though, it can be other things too, of course. Tell me, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool colour?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Changes… Let me think. Everything feels rather… murky these days, if I’m honest. I… I really can’t say. I don't pay close attention to such things, I'm afraid. Everything just… goes. Is that terribly unhelpful? I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, no. Alright. Any itching?
PATIENT: Itching? Hmm… Now that you mention it, yes. A little. Not constant, but… particularly on my arms and legs. It’s not terribly severe, but… bothersome. Like a slight irritation, really. I mostly just put it down to dry skin.
DOCTOR: Dry skin. Right. And you mentioned previous liver trouble… Do you recall what kind of trouble?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a very long time ago. I believe it was… hepatitis? Something along those lines. A very unpleasant illness, I recall. I was quite young then, and… well, things weren’t explained as thoroughly as they are today, I suppose. It involved a hospital stay, and… a lot of rest. But the specifics… they’ve faded. I truly apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis… alright. And were you ever told which type of hepatitis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That… I have no idea. Type A, B, C… it all sounds terribly confusing. I really haven’t the slightest. I just recall feeling very unwell, and being told to avoid certain foods. I sincerely wish I could provide you with more information, but my memory is simply… not cooperating. It’s quite frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I need to feel your abdomen, and check your skin more closely. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. An examination… if you think it’s necessary. It’s not terribly comfortable, is it? But please, proceed. I just want to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is… soft, a little tender in the upper right quadrant. And yes, as your daughter mentioned, your skin does have a noticeable yellow tinge – jaundice, as we discussed. I also notice some mild edema in your lower legs. Let’s get some blood work done to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your liver function, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. Can you provide a urine sample as well?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Blood work and a urine sample… perfectly fine. The more information, the better, I suppose. I do hope it won't take too long. I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We’ll get it done as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them. In the meantime, avoid alcohol and fatty foods. And try to rest. I suspect this may be related to your previous liver issues, but we need the lab work to confirm. Don't panic. It could be something minor. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. Avoid alcohol and fatty foods, rest… Yes, I can manage that. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your time. I just want to get this sorted, as quickly as possible. I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes, though I doubt it will. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Right. Very well. Thank you again. I think that will be all for now. .
DOCTOR: Next! .
