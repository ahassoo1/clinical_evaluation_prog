DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Komarov. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. I see you're here today with Medicare insurance. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Yes, that's right, Medicare. Well, it’s about the sun, really. I’ve been… extra sensitive to it lately. It’s been bothering me quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, “extra sensitive to the sun.” Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start… It’s not just getting a sunburn faster, though that happens too. It’s like… my eyes really bother me, even with sunglasses on. And my skin feels… tingly, almost itchy, even when it's not super bright out. It's just… more than usual, you know? I used to be able to handle a bit of sunshine, but now it feels like too much, too quickly. It started maybe a month or two ago, I think.
DOCTOR: A month or two ago… and it's affecting your eyes and skin, causing tingling and itchiness. Okay. To clarify, when you say “too much, too quickly,” are we talking about being outside for a normal amount of time, and then experiencing these symptoms, or is it happening even with very brief sun exposure?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It’s… even with very brief exposure, actually. Like, walking to the car, or even just standing near a window on a sunny day. It doesn’t take long for it to start. Before, I could be outside for an hour or so no problem. Now… five minutes and I'm feeling it. It’s just… strange. I haven’t changed anything, not that I know of. No new soaps or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant change in your tolerance to sun exposure over the past month or two, even with minimal exposure, and no known changes in your routine. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, not that I’ve noticed. No fever, no headache, no rash… just the eyes and skin. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual. But I thought that was just… life, you know? Being a bit run down. I haven’t been sleeping as well either, but I figured that was connected to the tiredness. It’s hard to say if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sun sensitivity, fatigue, and some trouble sleeping. Let's go through some more detailed questions to get a better understanding. First, have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the tingling and increased sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think carefully. No… no new moles, no changes in existing ones. No blisters or anything like that. The skin itself doesn’t look different, just feels… irritated. Maybe a little red after being in the sun, but that fades pretty quickly. It's not like a bad sunburn rash, more of a… flush, I guess. I’m trying to remember everything... I haven't noticed any scaling or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible changes to moles, no scaling, just a flush after sun exposure. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, even a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a little sniffle back in… April, maybe? But that cleared up really quickly. Nothing serious. I haven’t been to the hospital or anything. Just the usual little things you get from time to time. I've been pretty healthy, to be honest. That's why this is so confusing! It just… came on suddenly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illness. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… I lost my wife a few years back, and it’s been… hard. But physically, I was pretty healthy before all this started. I have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. Nothing else, really. No diabetes, no arthritis, no allergies that I know of. The doctor checks it every year, and it’s usually just the blood pressure. He hasn't ever mentioned anything else being wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, otherwise generally healthy. And you said it's been a few years since you lost your wife. I'm sorry for your loss. Can you tell me what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s been… a while. The medication… let me see if I can remember the name. It's… Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I haven't changed the dose or anything, everything's been the same. I get a refill every three months from my regular doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the usual things like a routine check-up?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No surgeries, no long hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups and the occasional cold. I've been pretty lucky, really. This whole sun thing is the first real medical issue I've had in… well, a long time. It’s making me a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no hospitalizations aside from a childhood broken arm. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had… diabetes, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it. No history of skin cancer that I know of. My wife’s family… I don’t know them very well, so I don’t have much information about their medical history. I’m not sure if that helps. It’s not a big family, really. Mostly just me and a few cousins.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and diabetes. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, if that. Nothing regular. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat a good diet, get some exercise when I can. This sun sensitivity is really throwing me for a loop, because I don't think any of my habits have changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. And you mentioned trying to stay healthy. Now, do you work outdoors, or spend a significant amount of time in the sun for any reason?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I'm a dental assistant, so I work inside all day. I usually walk to and from work, but that's it. And even then, I try to stay in the shade as much as possible. I'm actually trying to avoid the sun as much as I can now, because of this whole thing. It’s really strange, because I don’t think I’ve been getting more sun exposure recently. It feels like less, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no increased sun exposure, work indoors. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please sit up and I'll take your blood pressure and check your pulse?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, go ahead. I'm ready whenever you are. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. It’s been a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so, given your history. Now, I'm going to take a look at your skin. Please point to any areas where you've been experiencing the tingling or sensitivity.
PATIENT: It’s… pretty much everywhere, really. But it’s worse on my face, especially my cheeks and forehead. And my arms and hands feel it the most. It’s not a rash, like I said, just… a tingling, itchy feeling. And it gets red easily. It’s hard to point to one specific spot, because it’s all over, just some areas are worse than others.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm not seeing any obvious rash or lesions. Your skin feels warm to the touch and slightly flushed, as you mentioned. There is no noticeable swelling or tenderness. I'm going to examine your eyes next. Please look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. It does feel a bit sensitive when I look into bright light, though. Like a stinging feeling. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Your pupils are reacting normally, and I'm not seeing any inflammation in your eyes. However, you do seem to be sensitive to the light, which is consistent with your symptoms. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, a few possibilities come to mind. It's possible this could be related to a medication side effect, specifically Lisinopril. It's not a common side effect, but it can cause photosensitivity in some individuals. Another possibility is a viral infection, even a mild one that you may not have noticed. Less likely, but we need to consider other conditions that can cause skin sensitivity. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. These tests will give us a better picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I would also suggest a dermatology consult just to get a second opinion. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: That… makes sense. I hadn’t even thought about the Lisinopril being the cause. That would be good if that's all it is. The blood tests and seeing a skin doctor sound good to me. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. I just want to feel normal again. So, yes, please, let's do the tests and the consult. How do we go about scheduling those?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get those ordered right away. I'll have my nurse draw the blood for the CBC and CMP. She'll give you instructions on fasting if needed, but it shouldn’t be necessary. As for the dermatology consult, I’ll put in a referral for you to Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a week or two to get in. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding direct sunlight as much as possible. Wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. You can also use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. I’ll write that down for you as well. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything really well. Avoiding the sun makes sense, I’ve already been trying to do that. And I appreciate you recommending the skin doctor, just to be sure. It's reassuring to have a plan. Thank you, Doctor Soodeen. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get these tests done and hopefully have some answers soon. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as fever, severe headache, or a widespread rash, please contact my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Here are the lab orders and the dermatology referral. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too.
