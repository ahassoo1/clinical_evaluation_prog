DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this itching, really. Just… all over. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible, but constant.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks, I think. Maybe a little longer. I remember noticing it right around the Fourth of July, we had a small barbecue. But hard to say exactly when it started started, you know? It just sort of… appeared.
DOCTOR: And it began all over your body, or was it localised to a specific area initially?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it started on my back, actually. Just a little patch there. Then it spread to my arms, and then… well, pretty much everywhere. Not my face, thankfully. But legs, stomach, back… arms, definitely. It’s pretty evenly spread, if that makes sense. Not like one really bad spot and then a few little things. Just… everywhere. It's just annoying, more than painful, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it began on your back approximately three weeks ago around the Fourth of July, and has since spread fairly evenly across your body, excluding your face. And you describe it as more of an annoyance than a painful sensation. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or after any specific activity?
PATIENT: That’s right, you got it. And… now that you mention it, yeah, it’s worse at night. Definitely. When I’m trying to sleep, it really flares up. I think it's because I get warmer, maybe? And, hmm… after I shower. The warm water seems to make it worse for a little while. Not immediately, but like an hour or so afterwards. Then it calms down a bit, until bedtime, that is. It's a cycle. A very itchy cycle.
DOCTOR: Right. And you haven’t tried anything to alleviate the itching?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I have! I didn't want to bother you with this if it was something simple, you know? I tried some over-the-counter lotion, the one for eczema, I think. Didn't do much. Then I tried some calamine lotion, that helped for about five minutes, and then… nothing. I even tried some oatmeal baths, my wife used to swear by those, but no luck. Honestly, I'm starting to lose sleep over it. I really didn’t want to come in, but it's just… relentless.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you’ve noticed no changes in soaps, detergents, or anything else you’ve been using recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I’ve been using the same things for… well, years, really. Same laundry detergent, same body wash, same shaving cream. I haven’t changed a thing. That’s why I’m so confused. I haven't been exposed to anything new that I can think of. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Same routine, day in, day out. It's just… this itching. It feels like… under the skin, sometimes. It's hard to describe. Not a rash, exactly, just… itchy. Really, really itchy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Let's have a look at your skin. If you don't mind, please remove your shirt and trousers, and I'll perform a quick examination. We’ll see if we can identify anything obvious. I have a gown if you'd prefer.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Yes, of course. A gown would be… appreciated, thank you. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, you know? But if that’s what it takes. Where is it?
DOCTOR: Through there. You’ll find a gown on the hook. Take your time. I’ll be just outside when you’re ready. And when you're ready, please lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be just a moment. It’s… a bit drafty in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Let’s take a look. Hmm… No obvious rash, lesions, or signs of infection. The skin appears relatively normal in colour and texture. No wheals, excoriations, or palpable nodules. Interesting… No significant findings. Skin is dry, but that’s not unusual. I'm not seeing anything definitive here, Mr. Ferneding. It's a rather unremarkable examination, to be honest.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… frustrating. I mean, I feel itchy, Doctor. It’s not all in my head. It’s been driving me crazy for weeks. So, what does that mean? Is it something internal, then? Something I'm eating? Or… some kind of allergy I can’t figure out? I just want it to stop. I'm starting to scratch in my sleep, and my wife… well, she's gone now, but she would always tell me if I was doing that. It's a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Fernedding, sometimes these things are difficult to pinpoint. It could be a mild form of dermatitis, or even a reaction to something as simple as laundry detergent residue, despite your assurances. Or, it could be something more systemic, though given the lack of other symptoms, that’s less likely. We can run some basic blood work to rule out any underlying conditions, such as liver or kidney issues, and check for elevated eosinophil levels, which can indicate an allergic reaction. However, I suspect the results will be normal. I'm going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream for now. Apply it thinly to the affected areas twice daily. And an oral antihistamine at night to help with the itching. If it doesn’t improve within two weeks, we can consider a referral to a dermatologist. Here you are. And try to avoid scratching, Mr. Fernedding. It will only exacerbate the problem.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… and the cream. And the antihistamine. Two weeks. Right. I understand. It just… feels like a lot of hoping, doesn't it? Hoping the cream works, hoping the blood work is normal… hoping it goes away. It’s just… irritating. In more ways than one. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I'll go get those tests done, then.
DOCTOR: Yes. That will be all, Mr. Fernedding. And try not to worry unduly. Sometimes these things resolve on their own. The nurse will schedule your blood work on the way out.
