DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's… well, it’s my stomach. Been having trouble with it for weeks now. Just… constantly running to the bathroom. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the store had.
DOCTOR: “Everything the store had,” huh?
PATIENT: Yes, everything. You know, the usual things. Pepto, Imodium… those charcoal pills. Honestly, I shouldn’t have to tell you this. It's common sense. I’m a painter, not a doctor. It’s just… inconvenient, and it’s not getting better. It's been going on for too long.
DOCTOR: Look, I appreciate you're… resourceful. But “everything the store had” doesn’t really tell me much. When did this start, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t remember the exact date. Sometime in July, I guess. Maybe around the tenth? It was after that big rainstorm we had. Look, does it really matter? It’s been weeks, and I’m tired of being stuck near a toilet. I have jobs to do. People are waiting.
DOCTOR: Well, July is… broad. And yes, timing can matter. Was there anything different about what you ate around that time?
PATIENT: Different? No. Not really. Same old stuff. Fish, berries… what I always eat. I get my food locally, you know? Fresh. Unlike some people. It's not like I was eating anything… questionable. Honestly, I think it’s just something going around. Probably some bug. It’s summer. Bugs happen.
DOCTOR: Right. “Some bug.” And you said it’s… constant?
PATIENT: Yes! Constant. Or, not literally constant, but… most of the day. Several times. I can’t even leave the house for long without worrying. And it’s not just… a little upset. It’s… bad. Really bad. You know what diarrhea is, right? I shouldn’t have to explain that to a doctor. It's embarrassing even talking about it.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood?! Are you serious? No! Of course not! I would know if there was blood. I’m not an idiot. Look, I came here because I have a persistent stomach problem, not because I’m… bleeding internally. It’s just… loose. A lot. And it won’t stop. Is that enough information for you? I have work to get back to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Maybe a little… queasy sometimes, but that could be from being constantly worried about… well, you know. I haven’t thrown up or anything. Just… this. This awful, never-ending… situation. Honestly, I just want it to stop. I need something that actually works.
DOCTOR: And you’ve tried… Pepto and Imodium?
PATIENT: Yes! I told you! Several times! Do you even listen? I’ve tried everything over the counter. It helps for, like, an hour, maybe, and then it comes right back. It’s useless! Honestly, I thought doctors were supposed to be… helpful. This is a waste of my time. I should have just waited it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up. I really don’t have all day. And please, try not to ask me a million questions about things I’ve already told you.
DOCTOR: Lie down. I’ll listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I’m not comfortable talking about this, and I’m definitely not comfortable being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sounds… normal. No distention. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No! It’s just… tender. Obviously. I have a stomach problem, remember? Stop poking me. It’s uncomfortable. Look, I’m a painter. I use my hands. You’re going to mess something up. Just tell me what’s wrong and give me something to fix it. I don't have time for a full examination.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s hard to say without more information. Given the duration and your… limited attempts at self-treatment, it could be a number of things. I’m going to order a stool sample to rule out any parasites or bacteria. And, frankly, I think you need a referral to a gastroenterologist. This isn’t something I can just… wave a magic wand at.
PATIENT: A stool sample?! And a… a gastroenterologist?! Are you kidding me? That’s ridiculous! I just need something to stop the… the flow. I don’t need to see a specialist and get poked and prodded even more. I told you, it’s probably just a bug. I'll just… wait it out. This is a complete waste of my time and money. Forget it. Just… forget it. I’m leaving. .
