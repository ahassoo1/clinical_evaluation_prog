DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Maribeth. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Vanderwiele is the name. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie down. It feels…difficult. I don’t quite know how else to explain it. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. Breathing trouble when lying down… that’s definitely something we want to look into. Can you tell me a little more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a pain, exactly. More like…a squeezing. And I have to use more effort to breathe. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? A little more, perhaps. I sleep in a recliner now. It's better that way. I don’t like it, but it helps. I suppose it's easier to breathe when I'm sitting up. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. A squeezing sensation, needing more effort to breathe, and it's better when you're sitting up… that’s helpful. And it’s been going on for about a month or so. Okay, Maribeth, to get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… No, not really. It seems to happen regardless. Eating doesn’t change it. Walking doesn’t change it. Sometimes it’s a little worse at night, perhaps, but not always. I used to enjoy gardening, but even that doesn't seem to make a difference. I wish something did make it worse, so I could avoid it! It's just…always there, when I lie flat. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Maribeth. It's good to know it doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything specific. It being consistently worse when lying flat is a key piece of information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, my ankles do swell up sometimes. Not terribly, but enough to leave a mark from my socks. And I get tired rather easily. More easily than I used to, at least. Oh, and I’ve been waking up a couple of times a night to use the restroom. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I hadn't really connected those things to the breathing, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all things that can be related! Swelling in the ankles, increased fatigue, and waking up to urinate at night… thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a broader picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, nearly twenty years ago now. And I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but nothing since. My blood pressure has been a little high for years, I suppose. The doctor put me on a small pill for that, years ago. I take it every day. Other than that… not much. I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time, to be honest. I try to stay healthy. I really do.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, a history of pneumonia, and high blood pressure managed with medication. That's good to know. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s…lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. A small white pill. I take one every morning with my breakfast. And I have all my prescriptions at the pharmacy on Main Street, if you need to check. I try to be organized. It helps keep things straight. Is that…sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Maribeth, and good to know you’re so organized. Lisinopril is a common medication for high blood pressure. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I eat almost anything. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I remember. I used to help my mother with her canning, and she always said I had a strong stomach! I do try to avoid shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I don't want to leave anything out.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfect, Maribeth. No known allergies is good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had some trouble with her heart in her later years. She needed a pacemaker, eventually. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. And his mother, my grandmother, she had some kind of breathing trouble when she was older, but I don't recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. Is that useful information? I always feel bad I don't remember more details. Family history isn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: That is useful, Maribeth. Heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and breathing trouble in your grandmother… that gives us a good starting point. Now, I’m going to ask about some lifestyle questions, if that's alright. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. I didn’t approve. And I’ve always been fairly active, until recently. Gardening, mostly. A little walking. Now, with this breathing… it’s harder. But I used to be very active. Is that what you needed to know? I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Maribeth. Never having smoked is excellent. And it’s good to know you were active. Now, let's talk about alcohol consumption. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Just a small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Perhaps two or three times a week. It helps me relax. Nothing more than that. I don't drink hard liquor, and I've never cared for beer. Just a small glass of red wine. That’s all. I don't overdo it. I don't want to make myself unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about what's been going on or anything at all?
PATIENT: Well… I've noticed I've been waking up feeling a little… anxious, I suppose. Not terribly, but just a little uneasy. I don't know if that's related to the breathing or not. And I have a cat, a little tabby named Clementine. She likes to sleep on my chest, but I worry about her making it harder to breathe sometimes. It's probably silly. But I just wanted to mention it. I don't want to leave anything out. And honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again. This is tiring.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, Maribeth. The anxiety and even Clementine sleeping on your chest… those are good things to mention. It's not silly at all to think things might be connected, and wanting to feel normal again is completely understandable. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I understand that's part of figuring things out. Just be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to get to the bottom of this. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Alright, Maribeth. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/86. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you were just talking. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. And your ankles do have some mild pitting edema, as you mentioned. Okay, Maribeth. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure. The crackles in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles, along with your history of high blood pressure and fatigue, are all consistent with that. But we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I’m going to order a chest X-ray, an EKG, and some blood work, including a BNP level. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Congestive…heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. I just thought it was my breathing. I suppose that explains the ankles. And the tiredness. Tests…yes, of course. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. X-ray, EKG, blood work…yes, that sounds… thorough. Is it going to be painful? I don’t do well with pain, you see. And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what I'm dealing with. And… is there anything I should be doing now? Anything at all? I feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Maribeth. It is a lot to take in. And yes, I want to be as thorough as possible. The tests themselves aren’t painful. The EKG involves placing some sticky patches on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. The blood work is just a standard blood draw. The chest X-ray is quick and painless as well. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours to get everything back from the lab. I'll call you as soon as I have them and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. First, try to limit your salt intake. That will help reduce fluid retention. Second, try to elevate your legs when you're resting. That will help with the swelling. And third, if you're feeling short of breath, stop what you're doing and rest. I also recommend you follow up with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management. I can provide you with a referral if you'd like. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Limit salt…elevate my legs… yes, I can do that. I used to enjoy cooking, but I suppose I can manage with less salt. And I do sit a lot already, so elevating my legs shouldn’t be a problem. A cardiologist? Yes, please. A referral would be wonderful. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel better. And… what does all this mean? If it is congestive heart failure… what happens next? I've heard it's…serious. I'm not trying to be difficult, but I like to know what I’m facing. Even if it’s not good news. Just… explain it to me, if you would. In plain English, please. I don't understand all the medical terms. I’m just an old woman who wants to breathe easier.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to want to understand what's going on, Maribeth. And you’re absolutely right to ask. Essentially, congestive heart failure doesn't mean your heart has stopped working. It means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should be. Think of it like a pump that's getting tired. It can still pump, but it takes more effort, and it doesn't move as much fluid with each beat. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body, which is why you’re experiencing shortness of breath and swelling in your ankles. It is a serious condition, but it’s very manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. We can use medications to help your heart pump more efficiently and to reduce fluid retention. Lifestyle changes like limiting salt, elevating your legs, and getting regular exercise can also make a big difference. The cardiologist will be able to do more specialized testing to determine the exact cause of your heart failure and to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. They will also monitor your condition closely and adjust your medications as needed. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this. Many people live long and fulfilling lives with congestive heart failure. And we’ll be here every step of the way to support you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. A tired pump… I can understand that. And medications… lifestyle changes… yes, I can do those things. It’s…reassuring to hear it's manageable. And that people live full lives. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. I feel… less frightened now. A little bit, at least. So, the tests… and then the cardiologist… I’ll wait for your call. And I’ll try to limit the salt. And elevate my legs. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all? I want to be prepared. And… thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. For now, just focus on those things – limiting salt, elevating your legs, and getting some rest. It’s also important to monitor your weight. If you notice a sudden weight gain , let me know right away, as that could be a sign of fluid buildup. And if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Alistair Finch, a cardiologist here in town. I'll also give you a list of low-sodium foods to help you with your diet. I'll call you as soon as I have the test results. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you’re not alone in this. We’ll get through this together. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. You’ve been very thorough. And kind. I appreciate your patience with an old woman’s worries. The referral to Dr. Finch… yes, that’s wonderful. And the list of low-sodium foods… thank you. I’ll take good care of myself. I promise. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You’ve given me hope. That’s a precious thing. I think… I think I’ll go home now and rest. And maybe call my cat. She’s probably wondering where I am. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. And please do give Clementine a pat for me! Take care of yourself, and rest well. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. It was lovely meeting you. Have a good day. .
