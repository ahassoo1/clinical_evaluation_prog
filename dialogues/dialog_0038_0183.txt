DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, good morning to you too. It's…well, it's this tiredness. Always tired. It’s…bad. The liver, you know? They told me it’s the liver. I don't know why it's tired, just…tired. It's been going on a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've been experiencing persistent tiredness and you've been told it might be related to your liver. That's a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What do you mean, more? It's tiredness! Like…dragging. All the time. Even when I sleep, I’m still tired. It's not like a normal tired. It’s…heavy. I used to be able to work all day, now… now I need to sit after just a little bit. My wife does most of the work now. She is not happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It sounds very debilitating, and it's impacting your daily life and your work. And it's not relieved by sleep, which is definitely concerning. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It…it was after the sickness. The one with the yellow. Maybe two years ago? It was bad sickness. I was in the hospital for a long time. They said it was the liver then too. Then I felt better, for a little bit. But this tiredness… it came back slow. Not all at once. Just… got worse and worse. I don’t remember the exact date though. Dates are…difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tiredness started gradually after a liver-related illness about two years ago, following a period where you felt somewhat better. That gives us a good timeline. Do you remember what the doctors said specifically about the illness while you were in the hospital?
PATIENT: They said…something about inflammation. Very bad inflammation. And the liver was not working right. They gave me…pills. Lots of pills. And fluids. I remember the needles. Not nice needles. They kept taking blood. They kept saying it was the liver. I didn't understand much of what they said. It was too much talking. Too many doctors. They all said different things. Something about…the cells? Something about the cells being damaged. But I don’t know what that means.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you had a significant liver illness requiring hospitalization, and they mentioned inflammation and damage to the liver cells. That's helpful. Are you currently taking any medications for anything at all, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes. I take…something for the water. The water retention. My legs swell up if I don't. The little white pill. And…something for the stomach. Sometimes my stomach hurts. Brown pill. And that’s all I think. My wife handles the pills mostly. She knows what to give me. I don't like taking so many. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking a medication for water retention, a little white pill, and something for stomach pain, a brown pill. We'll need to get a list of those exact names and dosages from your wife. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don't think so. Never had a problem with a pill before. Except they make me feel tired! But not like…an allergy. Just tired. I get…a little itchy sometimes. But I get itchy all the time anyway. It's the weather, maybe. Or the old skin. I don't know. Nothing serious. I have never been to the hospital for an allergy. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies. We'll make a note of the occasional itchiness. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had liver problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Liver problems? Hmmm. My father… he drank too much. A lot of drinking. He was sick a long time ago. They didn't have good doctors back then. He just… got weaker and weaker. They said something about his stomach. Maybe liver? I don’t know. And my mother… she had the sugar. The diabetes. She took the shots. And that’s all I remember. My siblings are…gone now. All gone. So I don't know what they had. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had a history of heavy alcohol use and a possible liver condition, and your mother had diabetes. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I sit and work. Not much else. I used to garden, but…too tired now. I eat. My wife cooks. She makes good food. I don't drink anymore. Not since… a long time ago. I don't smoke. Never smoked. I mostly just sit. And sleep. Or try to sleep. Is that a lifestyle? It's not very exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've stopped drinking, you don't smoke, and your daily life is relatively sedentary. That's good to know. Finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you have any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stressors? The tiredness is a stressor. Always tired. My wife gets upset. She has to do everything. That’s a stressor. And…the money. It’s getting tight. The doctors… they want so much money. Everything is expensive. And I can’t work. So that's stressful. I don't go out much. I used to have friends… but they are gone now. Mostly just me and my wife. She worries a lot. That stresses me out. Is that enough stress? I think that's enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so financial concerns and the burden on your wife, as well as feelings of isolation and worry, are contributing to your stress. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your vital signs. I will also need to look at your feet and ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Whatever you need. Just…be quick. I get tired easily, you know. The exam… I hope it doesn't take too long. And don't poke too hard. My stomach hurts sometimes. And I don't like the cold stethoscope. It makes me shiver. Just…be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll warm the stethoscope first. I'll start with your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 82, temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. That's slightly elevated blood pressure, but not dramatically so. Your heart sounds are normal, but I do hear some diminished breath sounds at the bases of both lungs. We'll keep an eye on that. Your abdomen is soft, but I do detect some tenderness in the upper right quadrant, right where your liver is located. No significant distention. I notice some mild swelling in both of your ankles. This is consistent with the water retention you mentioned. Okay, Mr. Grumman. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, the tenderness in your upper right quadrant, the diminished breath sounds, and the ankle swelling are all concerning. Given your history of liver illness, we need to run some blood tests to evaluate your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. I also want to order a chest x-ray to evaluate those breath sounds. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? You want to take more blood? Is it necessary? I already give them so much blood. And an x-ray? I don't like x-rays. They…they make me nervous. But…if you think it’s necessary… I guess so. But can’t we just… give me something for the tiredness? Just something to make me feel better? All these tests… it just feels like poking and prodding. But…do what you think is best. Just…be quick, okay? I’m already tired just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Grumman. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about more tests, especially when you’ve already been through so much. Unfortunately, without those tests, it's difficult to determine the cause of your tiredness and rule out any serious underlying conditions. We need to find out what’s going on so we can get you the right treatment. The blood tests will give us information about how well your liver and kidneys are functioning, and help us identify any inflammation or infection. The chest x-ray will help us evaluate those diminished breath sounds and rule out any lung problems. I will order the tests right away, and we'll get them done as quickly as possible. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild supplement to help support your energy levels while we await the results, but this won’t address the underlying cause of your tiredness. I am ordering a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, a Liver Function Test, and a Chest X-ray. I am also prescribing a multivitamin with B vitamins to help with energy support. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, jaundice , or difficulty breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. One week. A week feels like a long time. But… if you think it’s best. The vitamins… that’s good. Maybe they will help a little. And I will come back in a week. And…I will remember what you said about the emergency room. If it gets bad. Just… try to be quick with everything. I don't want to spend the whole day at the clinic. It makes me tired just being here. And tell my wife to expect a bill. She will be upset about the money. Thank you, doctor. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Grumman. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to make the process as quick and efficient as possible. I will also let the billing department know to send your wife a detailed explanation of the charges. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let her know if you feel faint or dizzy during the procedure. Here’s a copy of the lab orders and a prescription for the multivitamin. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, Mr. Grumman, and try to rest.
