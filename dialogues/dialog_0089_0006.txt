DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s August 2nd, and I see you're 41 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, I’ve been… coughing up some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come get checked. It’s not a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie, I understand. Coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. Just to be clear, when you say coughing up blood, is it bright red, or more of a darker color?
PATIENT: Hmm… it was… brighter, I think. Not dark. More like… the color of strawberries, maybe? It happened a couple of times this week. Not every cough, just… sometimes. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Strawberry-colored sputum… okay. And can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: It’s… not a bad cough, usually. Just a little tickle in my throat. But when the blood comes up, it feels… a little deeper, I guess? Like it’s coming from further down. It doesn't hurt, not really, just… surprising. And a little frightening, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a generally mild cough with occasional bright red sputum that’s a bit surprising. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the cough?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I don’t think so… not that I’ve noticed. Maybe when I lie down flat? Sometimes it feels worse then. But I haven’t been able to connect it to anything specific. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but… it seems random.
DOCTOR: Alright. Random onset with positional component. Have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I don’t think I’ve lost any weight. My clothes… they still fit the same. No chills or sweats either. I’ve been sleeping okay, I think. Just… a little worried about what’s causing this. It's unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about any shortness of breath, chest pain, or wheezing?
PATIENT: No chest pain. And I haven’t noticed any wheezing. Sometimes I feel a little… tired, but I thought that was just from work. I walk a lot with my patients, you know? And… no, no shortness of breath. I can walk up the stairs fine. Everything feels normal… except for the blood, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history, Jeannemarie. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. And I broke my arm when I was a child, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I try to stay healthy. I eat well, I walk a lot, and… well, I’m a physical therapist, so I know a little bit about taking care of myself. My husband… he had some problems with his heart, but… he passed away last year.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Jeannemarie. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so no significant medical history for you, apart from the flu and a childhood broken arm. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. I've been very lucky, I think. Just… the broken arm when I was little, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else. I hope that's helpful.
DOCTOR: It is, thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he died when I was young, from something with his lungs, but I don’t remember the details very well. It was a long time ago. I don’t think anyone else in my family had any… serious problems. It’s hard to say for sure, you know? We don’t talk about these things very much.
DOCTOR: Okay. A history of hypertension in your mother and some lung issue in your father, though details are unclear. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I used to live in the city, but now I live in the suburbs. I have a small garden, and I enjoy walking. I live alone, since my husband passed. I have some friends, but mostly I keep to myself. Is that what you mean by ‘social history’?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, thank you. No alcohol, no smoking, lives alone. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had trouble with any medications. I've taken some pain relievers for headaches, and things like that, but nothing serious. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I'm usually very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to get all my vitamins from my food. Just… healthy eating, and lots of walking. That’s what I believe in. I don't even take a daily multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, Jeannemarie, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I hope you can find out what’s causing this. It’s making me a little anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Your heart rate and rhythm are normal. Your throat appears a little… red, but no obvious signs of infection or anything concerning. I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes. No significant swelling there either. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute and your oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. I'm not detecting a fever with my touch. It's important to get some imaging done to investigate this further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. A chest X-ray sounds… good. And the blood count. If that’s what you recommend, then please, go ahead. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can… get back to my life. I have patients who depend on me, you know. I hope it’s not anything serious. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jeannemarie. We'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The nurse will take you to get the X-ray and blood work done now. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if you cough up a significant amount of blood—more than just a few streaks—or develop a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I'm a little worried, but I trust you. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. I appreciate your time and your help. And… thank you for being so kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or you have any concerns. The nurse will escort you now. .
