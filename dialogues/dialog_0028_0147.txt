DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Memmolo. It's about a lump, I suppose. In my lower abdomen. I noticed it a few weeks back, and it hasn’t gone away. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… there.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. Weeks. Right. And it doesn’t hurt hurt, or just… noticeable?
PATIENT: Not sharp pain, no. More like… a fullness. Like something’s there when I press on it. It's not comfortable, but I wouldn't call it painful. It's just… concerning, you know? Especially since I haven’t had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Concerning. Yes. Well, many things can cause fullness. Have you noticed any…changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. Not really, no. Everything’s been pretty regular, if you want to call it that. Maybe a little… different, sometimes. Harder to pass things, perhaps? But nothing major, and it doesn’t happen every time. I didn’t think it was connected, to be honest. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: “Relevant” is a… broad term. Constipation can be associated with abdominal masses, but it’s rarely the cause. When did you first notice this… difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well, the difficulty… probably around the same time as the lump, maybe a week or so before? It's been on and off, like I said. Some days are fine, others… not so much. I mostly just thought it was something I ate, to be honest. I haven't really paid it much mind until the lump didn't go away.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. We’ll need to feel it, of course. Please, lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. I need a proper assessment.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. That sounds sensible. Is there a sheet I should put on? Or… do I just lie down? I don't want to be… impolite.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about the sheet. Just lie flat. And try not to tense your abdominal muscles. It makes it… difficult. I’ll be right back with the lubricant.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I'll try my best. It's a little cold in here, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes… it’s… firm. Location is consistent with your description. No rebound tenderness, thankfully. But it is quite sizable. We’ll need to rule out a few things. Do you have any family history of… abdominal cancers?
PATIENT: That's… a bit of a scary question, Doctor. Let me think. My mother had some stomach problems when she was older, but nothing specific like cancer, as far as I know. My father was healthy, mostly. No known cancers on either side, really. But… my grandmother on my mother’s side… she passed away young, from something… internal, I think. But it was a long time ago, and we didn't really talk about it much. It was… difficult times. Does that help?
DOCTOR: “Difficult times” aren’t a diagnosis, Mr. Raghunathan. But, noted. We'll need a CT scan. And blood work, to check tumor markers. It's standard procedure. I’ll write the orders now. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be thorough. Don’t worry. Or… do worry, if that’s what you do. It won’t change the results.
PATIENT: Right. Of course. A CT scan and blood work. That sounds… comprehensive. I suppose that's what I would want. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And… will I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? I'm not very good with medical things, if you don't mind my saying so. It all feels a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you to schedule the scan. You’ll likely need to drink a contrast solution beforehand – they’ll explain it. Results usually take 24-48 hours. I’ll have the nurse give you a list of instructions. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And thank you for… explaining everything, even if I feel a little anxious about it. I appreciate you being thorough. Would the nurse be able to tell me where I can find the restroom, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the left. And try not to panic. It’s probably just a… benign mass. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients.
