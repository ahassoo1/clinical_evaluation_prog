DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes, well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain. It’s my… down there. It's been hurting. It started a few days ago, I think? It’s hard to keep track of time these days, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, time does slip away. “Down there,” okay. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it's not… sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, and other times… well, other times it makes me a little uncomfortable. It doesn't radiate, if that makes sense? It stays… right there. I’m not sure if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, localized… not radiating. And it comes and goes. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. I really haven’t noticed anything specific. I’ve been doing a bit of woodworking, as usual… although, perhaps I’ve been standing more than usual? I've been trying to finish a commission. It's a rocking chair, actually. A lovely piece, if I do say so myself. But no, I haven’t bumped it, or anything like that. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Woodworking… standing more. Alright. And is this pain constant when you are standing, or does it seem to come and go even then?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not constant. Even when I'm standing, it comes and goes. It's… unpredictable, really. Sometimes I can work for hours and not feel a thing, and other times it bothers me after just a little while. It’s very… peculiar. I apologize for not being very precise, Doctor. It's just… hard to explain, and I'm not good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable… alright. Well, let's try to narrow it down. Has anything else changed lately?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Change? Not really… I’ve been eating… mostly the same. Sleeping… alright, I suppose. A little restless sometimes. Oh! My neighbor’s dog has been barking a lot more, but I don’t think that’s related. I don't… I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that’s what you mean. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. Just the… ache.
DOCTOR: No fever, no chills… alright. And have you noticed any… discharge?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… discharge? I… I don't know what you mean, Doctor. I apologize. Is that… something I should be looking for? I haven’t… noticed anything unusual. I’m so sorry. This is… a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Noelani. It's perfectly normal to be uncomfortable talking about these things. I just need to ask a few questions to get a clearer picture. By discharge, I mean any fluid coming from the area. No fluid at all?
PATIENT: No, no fluid. Absolutely none. I haven't… I haven't noticed anything like that, Doctor. I promise. I'm just… not very good at these things. I usually just try to ignore things and hope they go away. Which, usually, they do. But this… this hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Alright. No discharge. And you said it started a few days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days ago. Maybe three or four? It's… hard to be certain. Time just seems to… slip by these days. I was working on the rocking chair, and then… I noticed the ache. It wasn't very strong at first, but it's been… persistent. That’s why I decided to come in. I didn't want it to get… worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a… a very good question. Let me think… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I’ve had aches and pains, of course, from woodworking. But nothing quite like this. It’s not… a muscle ache, exactly. It's different. It's… deeper, somehow. And more… concerning. I truly can't remember ever having this specific type of pain before, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick examination. Just a standard pelvic exam, if you don't mind. It will help me rule out a few things. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh… an examination? Well… no, I don't think so. If it will help, then yes, please. It’s just… a little nerve-wracking, to be honest. Is it… will it be uncomfortable? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I'm just a little anxious.
DOCTOR: It may be slightly uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. It's a quick procedure. We'll just take a look to see what's going on. If you could please lie down on the examination table, and put your feet in the stirrups when you're ready. I'll need you to cover yourself with the sheet, and I'll come back when you're settled.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, of course. A sheet. Yes, I understand. It's… a little difficult to get up here. And… are these the right way? I'm so sorry to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Just a little higher with your right foot… yes, that’s better. And breathe normally. I'll be right back with the speculum. Just relax. It will be quicker if you're not tense.
PATIENT: Okay… I'm trying. It's… just a little embarrassing, you understand. I haven't… done this in a very long time. Is it… will it hurt? Please, Doctor, just tell me if it will hurt.
DOCTOR: It may cause some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. It will be over before you know it. Now, let's just get this over with.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear… that is uncomfortable… very uncomfortable… Please… just… hurry…
