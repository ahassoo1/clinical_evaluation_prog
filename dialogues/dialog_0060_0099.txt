DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Denis. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter regarding the results of a test I had done on my… insides, I believe. The letter mentioned it wasn’t quite normal, and frankly, it’s been causing me a bit of worry. It was an endoscopic test, if that helps clarify.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy, right. Okay. And when did you receive this letter?
PATIENT: Let me see… It arrived just last week, on July 26th, I believe. Yes, that was a Friday. I try to keep track of these things. It was postmarked from the clinic here, which is why I scheduled this appointment so quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, July 26th. And you said it mentioned something wasn’t quite normal. Do you recall what specifically the letter stated, or did it just say to follow up with a doctor?
PATIENT: It did state something specific, Doctor, though I confess I was a bit flustered reading it. It mentioned… inflammation, I think? And something about needing to discuss further testing. It wasn't terribly detailed, which is part of why I wanted to come in and speak with you directly. It didn’t give me much to go on, honestly. Just that the results weren’t within the… acceptable range, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Inflammation… right. And where exactly was this endoscopy performed?
PATIENT: It was done at St. Jude’s Hospital, Doctor. They referred me to you for the follow-up. A Dr. Ramirez performed the procedure, a very kind woman. I believe it was focused on my stomach and the beginning of my… well, the long tube after my stomach. I'm not terribly familiar with the proper names for these things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Denis. It's perfectly alright. So, St. Jude’s, Dr. Ramirez… and it was an upper endoscopy, looking at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Hmm. Let me pull up the report from St. Jude's. Just give me one moment. …Okay, here we are. It does show some inflammation in your duodenum, and a few small erosions. Have you been experiencing any symptoms – any pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, I have. Thinking about it… the heartburn has been rather persistent lately, especially after meals. And I've noticed a bit of… discomfort, not exactly pain, but a queasiness in my upper stomach. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely been more frequent in the last month or so. As for changes in… bowel habits, yes, I suppose. I’ve been a little more… irregular than usual, if you understand. Not severe, but noticeable. And sometimes, a bit of fatigue, though that could be something else entirely, given my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so persistent heartburn, queasiness, some irregularity, and fatigue. When you say irregular, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not a complete change, mind you. But normally, I am… quite predictable, if you understand. Lately, it’s been either a bit too frequent, or a bit… delayed. Not diarrhea, not constipation, just… off. It’s difficult to explain precisely. Perhaps less formed than usual, sometimes? And a bit darker in colour, I believe, though I hesitate to mention that. It’s a bit embarrassing, really. It hasn't been every time, but enough to cause me concern.
DOCTOR: Darker in colour… right. Okay, Denis. It sounds like we’re dealing with some inflammation in your duodenum, and these symptoms are consistent with that. Now, the erosions they found aren’t large, but we do need to investigate why this inflammation is occurring. Have you been taking any medications – over-the-counter or prescribed – regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, as recommended by my previous doctor for my… circulation. And I occasionally take Tums for the heartburn, when it gets particularly bad. Nothing else, really. Just the aspirin and the occasional Tums. I also take a Vitamin D supplement, but I’ve been doing that for years, and it hasn't changed recently.
DOCTOR: Aspirin daily… that’s good to know. Aspirin can sometimes irritate the stomach lining. And Tums as needed. Okay. We need to rule out a few things. I’d like to order a stool test to check for any bleeding and to rule out any infection. And I'm going to recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces stomach acid – for a few weeks. That should help with the heartburn and allow the inflammation to calm down. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable to me. A stool test and a medication to calm things down… that seems sensible. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I confess, I don't understand how these medications work, but if it will ease the discomfort and help determine what’s going on, I am all for it. What will be involved with the stool test? Is it… unpleasant? I apologize for asking, but I’m a bit nervous about these things.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask, Denis. It's a very simple test. You'll receive a kit with instructions. Basically, you collect a small sample of stool – a bit of your bowel movement – in a container. It's not pleasant, no, but it's a very quick process, and you can do it at home. The kit will explain exactly how to collect the sample and how to send it to the lab. We just need a small amount, and it’s best to do it a couple of times over a few days to get an accurate result. I’ll have the nurse explain everything thoroughly before you leave. Now, regarding the proton pump inhibitor, I'm prescribing Omeprazole. It's a commonly used medication. You'll take one tablet each morning, about 30 minutes before a meal. It can sometimes cause mild side effects like headache or diarrhea, but these are usually temporary. We’ll see how you respond to it in a few weeks. If your symptoms don't improve, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further testing, such as another endoscopy. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Omeprazole, one tablet before breakfast, and a stool test with instructions from the nurse. I can certainly manage that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what the next steps are. Thank you. Are there any particular foods I should avoid while I am taking the medication? Or anything else I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. That’s what I’m here for. As for foods to avoid, it’s generally a good idea to limit spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods, as these can exacerbate heartburn. But it’s not a strict diet. Just try to be mindful of what you eat and see if any particular foods trigger your symptoms. And it’s important to continue taking the Omeprazole even if your symptoms improve, as it takes time for the stomach lining to heal. If you experience any severe side effects – like severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools – stop taking the medication immediately and contact me. Here are your prescriptions and the lab order for the stool test. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions. I truly appreciate your kindness and clear explanations. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. Thank you again for your time and attention. I will follow your instructions carefully and contact the nurse if I have any issues. I hope you have a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. That's good to hear. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. I hope you feel better soon. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions with you. Have a good day. .
