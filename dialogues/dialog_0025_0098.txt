DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel. Have a seat. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor Fourney. Thanks. Just… wanted to check things out, you know? Never really been to a doctor much before, just thought I should. No real problem, just… curious.
DOCTOR: “Curious,” is it?
PATIENT: Yeah. I work on the boats, so I’m around the water a lot. Figure I should make sure everything’s okay with… well, with everything. It's just good to know, right? Don’t want nothin’ sneakin’ up on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, “preventative care” is… commendable, I suppose. Though usually people come in with a problem. Fine. Let's start with the basics then. You said you work on boats… what kind of work do you do exactly?
PATIENT: I’m a sailor and… an oiler. I keep the engines runnin’ smooth, check all the fluids, that kinda stuff. It gets kinda dirty sometimes, and… loud. Been doin’ it a few years now. Mostly big cargo ships, travelin’ all over. Is that somethin’ I should be tellin’ you about? The noise, I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, the noise is something you should be telling me about. Prolonged exposure to loud sounds can… well, let's just say it can cause problems. Do you use any ear protection?
PATIENT: Ear protection? Uh… not really. Not always. Sometimes I forget, and sometimes it's just too hot and stuffy with it on. We got some, but… I don't use it as much as I probably should. It's kinda hard to hear folks when you're wearin' it, you know? Especially when the engine's roarin’.
DOCTOR: Of course. Convenience is always more important than your long-term health, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Hey now, that ain’t fair! It’s not about bein’ convenient. It’s just… hard work out there, and you gotta be able to communicate. If I can’t hear the captain yellin’ instructions, that’s not good for nobody. I just… didn't think it was that serious.
DOCTOR: “Didn’t think it was that serious.” Well, let me assure you, prolonged noise exposure is quite serious. It can lead to permanent hearing loss, and tinnitus – ringing in the ears. Now, let’s move on. Aside from the noise, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Ringing in the ears… sometimes. Not all the time, but… after a long shift, yeah. Like a faint hum. Thought it was just from bein’ tired. And… maybe a little dizziness sometimes, but that could just be the boat movin’, right? I get seasick pretty easy too, so it’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: “Hard to tell” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Heindel. We need specifics. When do you experience this dizziness?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Um… it usually happens after a long shift, like you said. Especially if it’s a rough sea. I feel kinda off-balance, you know? Not like I'm gonna fall down, but… wobbly. And it lasts… maybe an hour or so. Sometimes longer. And I guess… my ears feel kinda full sometimes too, like pressure. Is that the noise stuff?
DOCTOR: It could be related to the noise exposure, yes. Though we need to rule out other possibilities. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check your ears, your balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Standin’ up's easy. Just let me know if you need me to do somethin’ weird, Doctor. I ain’t too good at them balance tests, never been much of a dancer.
DOCTOR: I am a physician, Mr. Heindel, not a dance instructor. Please just follow my instructions. First, let’s check your ears. Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup in both ears, and… slight redness of the right tympanic membrane. I'm going to ask you some questions during the exam. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Uh, no ma'am. Ain’t takin’ nothin’ regular. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache sometimes, but that’s about it. And… I got Medicare, if that matters. Divorced, so… I’m on that now.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen occasionally. Good to know. Now, close your eyes. I'm going to check your balance. Okay, a slight wobble on the right side. Now, follow my finger with your eyes… don’t move your head. Hmm. And now, can you tell me if you’ve had any recent head injuries?
PATIENT: No head injuries. Not that I remember, anyway. Fell off a ladder once when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Just a little bump. Ain't nothin' serious. Felt a bit dizzy after that, but I figured it was just from gettin' scared. Is somethin’ wrong? You lookin' kinda worried.
DOCTOR: “A little bump” and “a little dizzy” don’t quite cut it, Mr. Heindel. The inner ear is a delicate structure. You’ve reported a history of noise exposure, some dizziness, ringing in the ears, and now a past head injury… even a minor one. It’s possible you’ve sustained some damage to your vestibular system – that's the part of your inner ear that controls balance. The redness I observed in your right ear could indicate an infection, possibly related to the cerumen buildup. I’m going to order some tests. An audiogram to check your hearing, and a VNG – videonystagmography – to assess your balance function. And I want you to get a tympanometry to look at the eardrum. I’ll also order a CT scan of the head, just to rule out any underlying structural problems. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Woah, hold on a minute. A CT scan? That sounds… serious. All this stuff… I just came in for a check-up. I didn’t know it was gonna be this much. What does all this mean? And what's a tympa-whatsit? I don't even know what half these words are. Is it somethin' really bad?
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Heindel, that you neglected to seek medical attention for several years, and now we are playing catch-up. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a detailed view of your brain and inner ear. It’s not something to be alarmed about, it’s simply a precautionary measure. Tympanometry is a test to see how well your eardrum moves. Look, your symptoms, coupled with your history, are concerning enough to warrant a thorough investigation. Ignoring them won't make them go away. You have reported what could be the signs of vestibular dysfunction, possible hearing loss, and a previous head injury. We are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Deep breaths. Um… how long does all this take? And… will it cost a lot? I’m on Medicare, like I said, but… I don't wanna get a huge bill I can’t pay. And… what if it is somethin’ bad? What kinda treatment are we talkin' about? I gotta get back to work, you know? I can't be laid up for months.
DOCTOR: The audiogram and VNG should be scheduled within the next week. The CT scan may take a bit longer, depending on availability. As for cost, Medicare will cover a significant portion of the tests. However, there may be some co-pays or deductibles, so I recommend contacting your insurance provider to get a clear estimate. As for treatment, that depends entirely on the results of the tests. It could range from simple observation and medication for any underlying infection, to physical therapy for balance rehabilitation, or, in rare cases, more invasive procedures. Right now, it’s premature to speculate. I'm going to write you referrals for an audiologist and for radiology for the CT scan. I’ll also give you a prescription for some ear drops to clear up the cerumen buildup. Schedule these appointments as soon as possible. And please, make sure you protect your ears in the meantime. Wear earplugs or earmuffs whenever you’re exposed to loud noise. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Earplugs, schedule the tests… Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything, even if it's… a lot. I’ll call and get those appointments set up right away. And I promise I’ll start wearin’ ear protection. I didn’t realize it was so important. Is there anything else I should be doin' right now? Like… avoid flyin’ or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Flying shouldn't be an issue at this point. However, avoid any activities that could exacerbate your dizziness or cause a head injury. And I want you to follow up with me as soon as you have the results of the tests. Do not wait for a scheduled appointment. If your dizziness worsens, or you experience any new symptoms – such as hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or severe headache – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. No head injuries, follow up with results, emergency room if it gets worse. Got it. I’ll be careful. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. You’ve been a big help. I feel a little less worried now, even with all the tests. .
DOCTOR: See that you do. And do try to prioritize your health, Mr. Heindel. It's a far more valuable asset than any job. .
