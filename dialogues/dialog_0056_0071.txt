DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter saying I needed to come in about… well, about shots needed for some paperwork. I’m trying to get things sorted for a family member who is hoping to come visit from overseas. I believe it has something to do with a visa, but I haven’t a clear understanding of exactly what is required.
DOCTOR: Okay, Karry, that makes sense. It sounds like you’re needing documentation of certain vaccinations for your family member’s visa application. We do a lot of those here. To make sure I get everything right, can you tell me a little more about which family member is visiting and where they’re coming from?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My niece, Elina, she's hoping to come. She's currently living in… let me think… Ukraine. Yes, Ukraine. She wants to visit for a few months, and my son told me she needs these papers from a doctor here in the States. I mostly handle things locally, so I'm a bit lost on the international requirements. I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the subject.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Karry. It is confusing! Okay, Ukraine. That helps. Generally, for visitors from Ukraine, we'll want to make sure you’re up-to-date on your routine vaccinations, and then there are a few specifically recommended or required ones, depending on her travel history and current guidelines. Before we dive into specifics, let’s just quickly go through a general health check. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been quite fortunate in terms of major illnesses. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, a long time ago now, and I broke my wrist a few years back, but that’s about it. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to stay active and eat well, though these old bones do ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Karry. Appendix removal and a broken wrist – I'll make a note of those. And it's good you're staying active! Do you have any ongoing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I did have some trouble with my cholesterol a while back, but my doctor – Dr. Evans, over at the community clinic – got it under control with diet and exercise. It's been quite stable for years now. I see him for a check-up once a year, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Dr. Evans, noted. So, stable cholesterol, managed with lifestyle changes. Good work! Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing prescribed regularly, and I usually try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. Oh, and I occasionally take a fish oil capsule for my joints, too. Is that something you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do tell me everything, Karry. Fish oil and the occasional ibuprofen are both good to know. Okay, so multivitamin, fish oil, and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten just about everything over the years, and never had a reaction. My son always jokes I have an iron stomach! I've never had any trouble with bee stings or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Karry. No known allergies is great. Okay, before we move on to the vaccinations specifically, let’s quickly cover your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. I’ve never been one for any of that. Smoked a few cigarettes when I was a foolish young man, but I gave that up decades ago. Never touched alcohol, and I certainly don't partake in anything… recreational. A strong cup of coffee is my only vice, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Karry. Just coffee, noted. Now, just one more quick thing before we talk about vaccinations. Could you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm… well, I’m not terribly tall. Around five feet six inches, I believe. And as for weight… let me think. I weighed myself a few months back, and I was around 102 pounds. I’ve always been a smaller fellow.
DOCTOR: Okay, five feet six inches and 102 pounds. Noted. Alright, Karry. So, based on the current guidelines for visitors from Ukraine, and given your history, we want to make sure you're up-to-date on your tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine, your measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and your varicella vaccine. We should also discuss influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. Do you happen to know when you last received these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a lot of names! Truthfully, Doctor, I don’t have a record of those vaccinations. It was so long ago, and my doctor, Dr. Evans, retired a few years back. All my records were at his office. I remember getting some shots as a child, of course, but I couldn’t tell you which ones, or when. I suppose that means I’ll need them all again? It's just… needles aren't my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Karry, that’s very common. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t have those records. It just means we'll need to go ahead and get them updated to ensure you're fully protected, and to meet the requirements for your niece's visa. We can discuss the best way to manage your discomfort with the injections. Before we proceed, let's do a quick physical exam to assess your overall health. That will help me determine if there are any contraindications to any of the vaccinations. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. A check-up seems a good idea. And yes, please, let’s discuss those… injections. I’ve never been very brave around needles, if I’m being honest. Just… a warning would be appreciated, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Karry. I'll give you plenty of warning before each injection, and we can take it slow. We can also talk about some relaxation techniques if that would help. Alright, let's start with your vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Do you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, or cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. I breathe just fine, thankfully. A bit winded if I climb too many stairs, but that’s just old age, I reckon. I haven't had a cough in ages, and my chest feels perfectly alright. I do enjoy a good walk in the woods, when the weather allows.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Karry. A bit of shortness of breath with exertion is common as we get older, but it’s good that you don't have any other symptoms. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear, mild congestion. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Do you have any issues with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: My vision isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I wear reading glasses now, for close work. But my distance vision is still alright. And my hearing… well, I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves, if they’re speaking softly. But it’s nothing too concerning, just the usual signs of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. We can note those for your records. Now, just going to quickly feel your abdomen. Anything tender?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing tender. My stomach feels alright, just a little… rumbley, perhaps. I had a biscuit with my coffee this morning, so that's probably it. It's nothing to worry about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear, Karry. Everything feels normal. Based on this quick exam, there don’t seem to be any contraindications to vaccination. We can proceed with updating your Tdap, MMR, and Varicella vaccines, and discuss the Influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations. Would you like to go ahead and get those done today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, if you think it’s best. I'd like to get this sorted for my niece. Though… perhaps we could start with the least painful one? And, as I mentioned, a warning would be greatly appreciated before each injection.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Karry. We'll take it slow and do it at your pace. We can start with the Tdap vaccine, as it’s often the least reactive. It’s an intramuscular injection, which means I'll be injecting the vaccine into your upper arm muscle. I’m going to clean the injection site with an alcohol swab now. Then, I’ll give you a warning before the injection. You might feel a brief stinging sensation, but it should pass quickly. Okay, Karry, here we go. I'm giving you a warning now… injection in three… two… one… There we go. All done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ooh! That… wasn’t as bad as I feared, but still… a bit of a sting. It’s fading now, thankfully. Just… a bit of discomfort. Is there anything I should do? Perhaps an ice pack?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Karry. A little soreness is expected. You can apply a cool compress to the area for 15-20 minutes if you like. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can also help. Avoid strenuous activity with that arm for a few hours. Do you want me to apply a cool compress now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be most kind. A cool compress sounds lovely. And thank you for being so patient with me. I do apologize for being a bit of a fuss. It’s just… needles aren’t my favorite companions.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Karry. It’s perfectly okay to be anxious about needles. My job is to make sure you're comfortable and informed. Now, we have the MMR and Varicella vaccines to go. They are both subcutaneous injections, which means I'll be injecting them just under the skin. These vaccines may cause a little more soreness than the Tdap, but it should still be manageable. Would you like to proceed with those now, or would you like to take a short break?
PATIENT: Let’s… let’s just get them over with, Doctor. I'd like to be finished today, if possible. Perhaps if I don’t dwell on it too much… And yes, please, do warn me beforehand. I trust your expertise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Karry. We’ll take it one step at a time. First, we’ll do the MMR vaccine. I'm going to clean the injection site on your upper arm now. Then, I’ll give you a warning before the injection. Okay, Karry, here we go. Injection in three… two… one… There we go. All done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: That… wasn't terrible. A bit more pinch-y than the last one, perhaps. But it’s fading. I can feel a bit of warmth around it now. Still, not the worst experience. Now, the last one, you said? Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the Varicella vaccine left. You're doing great, Karry. Alright, here we go. Injection in three… two… one… There we go. All done! How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Well… I’m done! That was… surprisingly manageable, all things considered. A bit sore, of course, but nothing I can't handle. Thank you, Doctor. You were very kind and patient with me. I truly appreciate it. Now, about those other vaccinations you mentioned… the flu and the COVID one? Perhaps we can discuss those at a later date? I think I've had enough needles for one day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Karry. You're very welcome. I'm glad we got through it. And yes, we can definitely discuss the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines at your next appointment. No need to rush into anything. Here's a pamphlet with information about potential side effects from the vaccines. Mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site are common. If you experience any other symptoms, like fever or rash, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything admirably. You've been a lifesaver, truly. I appreciate your patience and kindness more than words can say. I will be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss those other vaccinations. Thank you again for everything. Have a wonderful day, Doctor. And thank you for not laughing at my… needle aversion.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Karry. It was my pleasure. And no need to apologize for being anxious – it's perfectly normal. I'm glad we could get it sorted out. Have a wonderful day as well, Karry, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care!
