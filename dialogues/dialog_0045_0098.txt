DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor Billman. Thanks for seeing me. It's just... well, I was kinda curious, ya know? I ain't really sick sick. Just wanted to get a check-up, see how things are goin'. Been a while since I had anyone look at me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. Good idea, don't need to be sick to come see a doctor. It's been a while, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a long while. Last time...hmm... probably when I was still married. Maybe five years ago? Just bein' a sailor keeps you movin', usually. But figured I should probably make sure everything's alright. It’s good to be safe, right?
DOCTOR: Right, preventative care is always a good thing. Five years… alright. Well, let's get some information down. Just to get a baseline. You mentioned being a sailor, is that full-time?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much full-time. Marine oiler, mostly. Travel a lot, see different ports. It's good work, keeps me busy. Sometimes I wish it wasn't so busy, but ya know… pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Right. And being on the water… are you experiencing any… issues with seasickness, or dizziness that isn’t related to the ship’s motion?
PATIENT: Seasickness? Nah, not really. Used to get it bad when I first started, but ya get used to it. Not much trouble with that anymore. Dizziness… hmm. Sometimes, when I stand up real quick, I feel a little lightheaded, but it goes away fast. It ain't been happenin' a lot, so I didn’t really think much of it. Is that somethin' I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness when standing… alright. We'll get to that. Just trying to cover all the bases. Now, any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Had the usual kid stuff, ya know? Chickenpox, broke an arm once fallin' out of a tree... but nothin' serious. No big surgeries or nothin' like that. My mom, she had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but that was her. I haven't had anythin' like that. Does high blood pressure count as somethin'? I think someone told me that runs in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension. That’s good to know. We’ll definitely check that. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had diabetes, or maybe kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... diabetes, yeah, my uncle on my dad's side had that. Lost a foot to it, actually. Sad thing. Kidney problems... I don't think so. My grandma had trouble with her joints, but I don't know if that's the same thing. It's kinda hard to keep track, everyone's gettin' older, ya know? I wasn't really payin' attention to all that when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: Nope. Not takin' nothin' at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just… vitamins sometimes, if I remember. Multivitamin, ya know? But that's about it. Don't even really bother with those much anymore, to be honest. I mostly just try to eat good when I can, get enough sleep, and not fall off the ship. Does that count as medicine?
DOCTOR: That’s… a good strategy. Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I ate peanuts all my life, never had a problem. Shellfish is okay, too. I think my mom said I was allergic to bee stings when I was a little kid, but I haven’t been stung since I was, like, five years old. I think I'd remember if I was gonna swell up and die! I'm pretty good with food. Gotta be, when you're travelin' all over, ya gotta eat what's available.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I ain't got nothin' to hide. Just… try to be gentle, alright? I get kinda ticklish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. … 142 over 90. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… normal rate, but a slight murmur. Not necessarily concerning, but we'll keep an eye on it.
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean, exactly? Is that… bad? I mean, I feel fine. I been workin' hard, but that’s just what sailors do, right? Is it somethin’ I need to worry about? You said my blood pressure was high, too. Is that from the workin’? Or is it somethin’ else?
DOCTOR: A murmur isn’t always something to be alarmed about. It's just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It can indicate a valve problem, but many people have innocent murmurs. We’ll need to do an EKG, just to be certain, and maybe an echocardiogram if that comes back abnormal. As for your blood pressure, 142 over 90 is elevated. It could be from physical exertion, but it’s also something that runs in your family, and it’s something we need to manage. We’ll do some bloodwork to check your kidney function, cholesterol, and blood sugar. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with you, but we’re going to rule things out, and get a better baseline to monitor your health. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, yeah, that makes sense. Rule things out. Check everything. So… an EKG, that’s like… the stickers on your chest, right? I think I had one of those once. And an echo-whatsit… is that with the gel on your chest? Sounds kinda weird. And bloodwork… yeah, I guess I can handle that. So, it ain’t necessarily nothin’ bad, just… checkin’? Just makin’ sure everything’s tickin’ like it should? Because I gotta be honest, Doctor, I kinda need everything to be tickin’. Gotta keep sailin’, ya know? Gotta pay the bills.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Routine checks. Precautionary measures. And yes, the echocardiogram involves gel on your chest. It's painless, I assure you. We’ll get the orders for those tests sent over to the lab right away. In the meantime, let’s discuss lifestyle modifications. Reducing salt intake, regular exercise—when you’re not working, of course—and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial. We’ll also want to monitor your blood pressure at home. I’ll have the nurse show you how to use a home blood pressure monitor. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Home blood pressure monitor… yeah, that’s probably a good idea. But… honestly, Doctor, it’s kinda hard to cut down on salt when you’re at sea. Everything’s salted, ya know? Gotta preserve the food. And when I’m off-shift… well, I usually just try to sleep. Not much energy for… regular exercise, after a long shift. I guess I could try, but it ain’t gonna be easy. And sleepin’… that’s kinda my exercise, ya know? Is there… is there anything else I could do? Some kinda… pill, maybe? Just somethin’ to keep it down a little? I’m not lookin’ for a miracle, just… a little help.
DOCTOR: We can discuss medication if lifestyle changes aren't sufficient. However, pills aren’t a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. There are some dietary changes you can make, even at sea. Avoiding processed foods, reading labels, and limiting your sodium intake where possible. And while I understand your exhaustion, regular, moderate exercise is vital for your cardiovascular health. Even 30 minutes of walking a day can make a difference. We'll start with the tests, monitor your blood pressure, and reassess. The nurse will go over some resources for managing your diet and exercise. We’ll discuss medication options if your blood pressure remains elevated after a month of consistent lifestyle modifications. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that’s agreeable. Tests first. Lifestyle changes… I’ll try. I’ll really try. It just… it ain’t gonna be easy. But I gotta keep sailin’, ya know? Gotta make a livin’. So, the nurse… she’ll tell me about the food and the walkin’? And then we wait a month? And then… maybe pills? Okay. That sounds… doable. I guess. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I should go get those tests done, then. .
DOCTOR: Yes. The nurse will schedule those tests for you. I’ll see you in a month. Try to be consistent with those changes. It will benefit you in the long run. .
