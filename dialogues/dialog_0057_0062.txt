DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Sieh. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter with my work. They are… requesting everyone wear masks, and I have some difficulty with that. I believe this visit is to discuss a possible exemption, or some way to continue working comfortably.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. So, your employer is now requiring masks, and you’re hoping we can discuss whether a medical exemption might be appropriate, or explore other options to allow you to continue working comfortably. Before we get into that, can you tell me a little more about why you're experiencing difficulty with wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. And thank you for understanding. It's… difficult to explain precisely. It isn't a fear, not exactly. More… a feeling of being… closed in. A pressure, almost, but not painful. It makes it hard to breathe easily, and my heart begins to race. It’s… unsettling. I’ve tried different types, different materials, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. It happens with all of them. I hope that makes some sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’re describing some anxiety or discomfort related to the sensation of wearing a mask. A feeling of being restricted, and that triggering some physical symptoms – the racing heart, the difficulty breathing. Have you experienced this feeling before, perhaps in other situations besides wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Though, not often. When I was a boy, I… well, there was an incident. A small space, a misunderstanding, and I became… quite panicked. It was resolved quickly, thankfully, but I've always felt a little uneasy in tight places, or when I feel… trapped. It's not a constant thing, Doctor, just… there. It’s much worse with the mask, though. It feels like it brings that feeling forward, makes it much stronger.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue. That’s helpful context. It sounds like you may have some degree of claustrophobia or, at the very least, a sensitivity to situations that create a feeling of confinement. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history. I see here you have Medicare, and your height and weight are recorded as 190cm and 89kg, respectively. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that information is correct, Doctor. And thank you for checking. I do not have any other significant medical conditions, no. I have seen a doctor regularly for checkups, and everything has always been within normal range. I have not taken any medication regularly for several years. I was briefly treated for high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it was managed with lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and has been stable ever since. Nothing else, Doctor. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No major medical history, and your blood pressure is currently well-controlled with lifestyle changes. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I don't have any known environmental allergies. I’ve… spent a lot of time outdoors, working and traveling, and never experienced any difficulties in that regard. I believe my body is quite resilient, Doctor, but this mask… this is different. It feels like it interferes with something fundamental, something… natural.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’re generally a healthy individual with no known allergies or significant medical conditions. Now, let’s do a brief physical exam. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen saturation level just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I have no objection at all. I understand the need for a baseline, and I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed at your convenience. I'll do my best to remain calm and still. It’s… just the thought of something covering my face makes it a little harder to breathe, but I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Just relax, and breathe normally. I'll be quick. Lungs sound good. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds regular as well. Your pulse is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be from simply discussing this, or anticipation. Now, I’m going to quickly check your oxygen saturation with this small clip on your finger. Oxygen saturation is excellent at 98%. So, physically, everything seems normal. Your heart and lungs are functioning well, and you’re getting plenty of oxygen. It sounds like this is more of an anxiety-related response than a physical limitation.
PATIENT: That is… relieving to hear, Doctor. I was worried there might be something wrong with my breathing, but that puts my mind at ease. It is as I suspected then – a matter of… feeling restricted. It seems my body reacts more strongly to the sensation than anything else. I am grateful for your thorough examination, Doctor. What would you recommend, then? Is there some way to accommodate my… sensitivity, and allow me to continue working?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. It's good we could rule out any underlying physical issues. Given your normal exam findings, this sounds like a case of anxiety triggered by the feeling of restriction. There are a few options we can explore. First, we could discuss strategies for managing anxiety, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques, that you could practice while wearing a mask. We could also consider a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders, who could provide more comprehensive support. Secondly, we can document your sensitivity and explore whether your employer might be able to offer a reasonable accommodation. That could include options like a face shield instead of a mask, working in a space with more ventilation, or modifying your work duties to minimize contact with others. However, please understand that a complete medical exemption is less likely, given your overall health. But documenting your sensitivity and working with your employer to find a solution is a good first step. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: That sounds… quite reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you outlining those possibilities. I believe I would be most comfortable exploring the documentation and accommodation route first. I’m not… inclined to seek therapy at this time, but the idea of managing my anxiety with techniques I can practice myself is appealing, should the accommodation prove difficult. Would you be able to provide me with a written note, outlining my sensitivity to wearing masks, and recommending a face shield as a possible alternative? And perhaps some guidance on deep breathing exercises I can try? I would be very grateful for that, Doctor. I believe a face shield would address the feeling of restriction without compromising safety.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knabenshue. I can certainly provide you with a note outlining your sensitivity to masks and recommending a face shield as a possible accommodation. I’ll include a brief explanation of the anxiety you experience, and the impact of the feeling of restriction. I'll also print out a handout with instructions on diaphragmatic breathing – that’s a type of deep breathing exercise that can help calm your nervous system. It takes practice, but it can be very effective. Here you go. This note is for your employer, explaining your situation. And this is the handout with the breathing exercise. Do you have any questions about the note or the exercise?
PATIENT: That is… wonderful, Doctor. Thank you very much. This is exactly what I was hoping for. The note is clear and concise, and the handout seems very helpful. No, I don't believe I have any questions at this time. You have been most accommodating and understanding, and I truly appreciate your assistance. I feel much more confident about approaching my employer with this information now. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. Remember, it's okay to advocate for your own needs. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day, and please take care. .
