DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. Well, it’s rather… embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve gotten myself into a bit of a pickle with a diet, you see. A rather… enthusiastic young man at the gym suggested it, and I, perhaps foolishly, decided to give it a go. It’s all a bit much, and I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I do anything… drastic.
DOCTOR: A new diet, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. It’s called… well, the young man called it the “Apex Protocol.” Sounds rather impressive, doesn’t it? It involves… a very limited intake of carbohydrates, a great deal of protein, and… quite a lot of kale. And a specific timing for everything, down to the minute. It’s all very precise. I confess, I’m a bit of a stickler for detail myself, which is likely why I was persuaded. But it’s rather… restrictive.
DOCTOR: Restrictive diets can sometimes cause more trouble than they're worth. And “precise timing” often means it’s difficult to maintain long-term. Tell me, Mr. Vantine, how long have you been following this “Apex Protocol”?
PATIENT: Oh, not terribly long, thankfully. Just over a week, I believe. Started on the twenty-fifth of July. I’m rather good with dates, you see. I was hoping to lose a few pounds before a… a reunion with some old colleagues. Nothing strenuous, just a desire to appear… presentable. But it’s leaving me feeling rather… depleted, frankly. And I’ve had a bit of trouble sleeping.
DOCTOR: A week. Alright. And you mentioned trouble sleeping… is that all?
PATIENT: No, not precisely. My energy levels are rather low, and I’ve noticed a… a slight dizziness when I stand up too quickly. It’s not debilitating, mind you, but noticeable. And I’m finding it rather difficult to concentrate on my work. I’m a special effects artist, you see, and detail is paramount. It's rather frustrating, I assure you. It’s all rather… unlike me. I usually have a very sharp mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Dizziness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating… and this is all since starting the diet?
PATIENT: Yes, quite definitively. Before that, I was perfectly… functional. Perhaps a bit creaky, as one does at my age, but otherwise quite sound. I’ve always been rather particular about my health, you see. Regular exercise, a balanced diet – well, usually a balanced diet. This “Apex Protocol” was a departure, and a rather unfortunate one, it seems. I do apologize for taking up your time with this… folly.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Vantine. It's good you came in. Now, let’s go through your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, actually. I had my appendix removed in my youth – a rather unpleasant experience, I recall – but otherwise, remarkably healthy. I do have slightly elevated cholesterol, which my previous doctor monitored, but nothing requiring medication. I’ve always been able to manage it through diet and exercise. That is, until this… experiment. I had a routine check-up last year, and everything was satisfactory. I’d be happy to provide you with the details from my previous physician, if you require.
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, thank you. And any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat practically anything – though I’ve never particularly cared for olives, if we’re being honest. As for medications, I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as a preventative measure, and a vitamin D supplement during the winter months. That’s it. Remarkably simple, really. I pride myself on maintaining a rather… uncomplicated system. The “Apex Protocol” was the complication, not the other way around. It’s quite embarrassing, isn't it, relying on a young man at the gym for dietary advice?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: A fair question. My father had high blood pressure in his later years, and my mother had a touch of arthritis, but otherwise, relatively unremarkable. No history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer on either side, as far as I’m aware. My siblings are both in good health, as well. Though my sister does have a rather unfortunate fondness for sugary pastries, which I frequently advise against. But genetics aside, I believe a healthy lifestyle is paramount. And this… diet, regrettably, is not that.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no significant family history. And you said you've been on this diet for just over a week. Before we proceed, could you describe a typical day of eating on the "Apex Protocol"?
PATIENT: Certainly. It begins with a protein shake – whey protein, I believe – and a small handful of almonds. No carbohydrates whatsoever. Lunch is typically grilled chicken breast with… a rather large portion of kale. And a small salad, with olive oil and vinegar, though I’ve been avoiding the olives, naturally. Dinner is similar – fish, or occasionally lean beef, and, you guessed it, more kale. The young man emphasized the importance of precise portion sizes, and timing. Everything is measured, weighed, and consumed at specific intervals. And, of course, plenty of water. It's… rather austere, to be frank. And distinctly lacking in enjoyment. One misses a good apple, or a slice of toast, you know? I’ve been supplementing with a multivitamin, hoping to compensate for the lack of variety. But it feels… insufficient.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well, that is a rather… direct question, Doctor. To be frank, yes. A degree of… irregularity. Not severe, mind you, but noticeable. And… a certain lack of… volume, shall we say? It's hardly a topic one discusses over tea, but I suppose honesty is paramount in a medical setting. It's likely due to the lack of fiber, I suspect. Kale, while nutritious, doesn't seem to be quite… sufficient in that regard. And the lack of carbohydrates, naturally. It's all rather… unpleasant, really. A far cry from my usual regularity, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. Vantine. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your throat and ears, and palpate your abdomen. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Quite agreeable. I trust your professional judgment implicitly. I’m rather accustomed to examinations, you see – routine check-ups and the like. Though I confess, I’m not particularly fond of the… stethoscope. It always feels rather cold. But I understand its necessity. Please proceed at your leisure. I shall endeavor to remain still. And if you require me to remove any garments, simply let me know. I’m quite prepared. Though, if I may ask, is this a standard procedure for… dietary indiscretions?
DOCTOR: It’s standard to perform a basic exam when someone presents with these kinds of symptoms, Mr. Vantine. It helps us rule out other potential causes. It's a precaution, more than anything. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your pulse is a little fast, but again, within acceptable limits. Your abdomen is soft, but I note some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. No masses or significant distension. Alright, Mr. Vantine. Everything appears normal, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and mild abdominal tenderness, which could be related to the diet.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Though the mild tenderness is hardly surprising, given my… dietary choices. I confess, I haven't been feeling quite myself, and it's good to know there isn't anything more… sinister at play. So, what are your recommendations, Doctor? Should I simply revert to my usual diet? And is there anything I can do to… mitigate the damage, so to speak? I’d prefer to avoid any drastic measures, if possible. I’m rather fond of a good routine, you see. And a sudden change might… upset the equilibrium.
DOCTOR: I strongly advise you to discontinue this "Apex Protocol" immediately, Mr. Vantine. It’s clearly not agreeing with you. It’s overly restrictive and lacks essential nutrients. As for mitigating the damage, I recommend a gradual reintroduction of carbohydrates, focusing on complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. And increase your fiber intake slowly to avoid any digestive discomfort. Continue with a balanced diet, incorporating lean protein, healthy fats, and plenty of fluids. And, perhaps most importantly, listen to your body. Don't force yourself to eat anything you don't enjoy. I also recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home for a week, and if it remains elevated, we'll discuss potential medication. And, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or fatigue – contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: No, that is perfectly… sensible, Doctor. Discontinuing the diet is, I suspect, the wisest course of action. And a gradual reintroduction of carbohydrates seems… prudent. I confess, I was rather hoping for a quick fix, but I understand that such things are rarely attainable. Monitoring my blood pressure at home… that is a good suggestion. I do have a device, thankfully. And I shall certainly heed your warning about contacting you if my symptoms worsen. I confess, I’m rather embarrassed to have troubled you with this… folly. A young man at the gym, you know. One really ought to know better. But thank you, Doctor. Your advice is most appreciated. And I shall endeavor to follow it… diligently. Perhaps I’ll stick to a good book and a cup of tea in the future, rather than chasing elusive dietary perfection. Do you think a small slice of toast with breakfast would be… permissible?
DOCTOR: A small slice of toast with breakfast is absolutely permissible, Mr. Vantine. In fact, I encourage it. It’s a good starting point. And please, don’t feel embarrassed. It’s my job to help, and it’s always better to err on the side of caution. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most helpful, and I am immensely grateful for your time and expertise. I shall endeavor to follow your advice and… rediscover the joys of a balanced diet. And perhaps avoid unsolicited advice from young men at the gym in the future. Thank you again, Doctor Press. I wish you a pleasant day. And if you don’t mind, I believe I’ll go and have that slice of toast.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your toast, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any further concerns. Have a good day to you as well.
