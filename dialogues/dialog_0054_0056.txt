DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s good to meet you. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though frankly, I wish it wasn’t a good morning. I’m here… well, it’s about my work. It’s become… tiresome. Utterly tiresome. I suppose you need a proper explanation, but honestly, I haven’t the energy to delve into all the details. Is there a quicker way to address this?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this is quite frustrating for you. We can definitely try to get to the core of it quickly. “Tiresome” can mean a lot of things. Could you tell me a bit more about what specifically is tiresome about your work?
PATIENT: It’s… the students, mostly. A complete lack of respect for knowledge these days. And the administration… endless paperwork and pointless meetings. Honestly, it feels like I’m spending more time managing them than actually teaching. Though, teaching… well, even that is becoming a chore. They simply don’t want to learn. It’s… demoralizing. But I doubt you need a lecture on the decline of modern education.
DOCTOR: No, I certainly don’t need a lecture on that, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're feeling very stressed and overwhelmed by a lot of different things at work – the students, the administrative burden, and a general feeling of being unfulfilled. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, and to make sure we're addressing everything, could you tell me a little bit about what your work is exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly. I’m a library science teacher. Postsecondary. I teach young adults how to… well, how to use a library. Research, cataloging, proper sources… the basics, really. Though, as I said, they don't seem to want to learn the basics anymore. It's all… internet searches and unreliable sources. A complete mess, frankly. Are we quite finished with introductions? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Schlatterer. Library science teacher at the postsecondary level. I apologize for asking – sometimes it’s helpful to have the full picture. It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated with the changing landscape of information and the challenges that presents for your students. And I appreciate you mentioning your luncheon appointment – we should definitely be mindful of your time. To help me understand how this is affecting you, could you tell me a bit about how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's… difficult to say precisely. A few months, perhaps? It’s all blurring together, to be honest. It's been a gradual decline. Initially, it was just a few… troublesome students. Then the administrative changes started. More paperwork, more meetings, less time for actual teaching. It’s all… compounded, I suppose. It feels like years, frankly. A very long, tiresome year. Is there a point to all these questions, Doctor? Or are we simply cataloging my grievances?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like it’s been a slow build of stressors that have accumulated over time, and that's very common. No, we're not just cataloging grievances. I'm trying to get a sense of the impact this is having on your overall well-being. Aside from the frustration at work, have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Sleep? What is sleep? Honestly, I’ve barely been sleeping properly for… well, a long time. As for appetite… I manage to eat, I suppose. Though, it’s hardly enjoyable. And energy… good heavens, the energy is gone. Utterly depleted. I find myself… fatigued, constantly. I used to be a very active man, you know. Now… well, now I simply try to get through the day. Is that what you wanted to hear, Doctor? A litany of my failings? I really must check the time.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, that’s not a litany of failings at all. That’s helpful information, and it’s good you’re sharing this with me. Difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, and fatigue are all things we need to consider. Have you been experiencing any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes, perhaps. It feels as though my entire profession is becoming… irrelevant. The students don’t care, the administration doesn’t care, and frankly, I’m starting to wonder if I care anymore. As for sadness… I wouldn't call it sadness, exactly. More like… a profound disappointment. A weariness of the soul. And loss of interest? Everything feels… muted. The joy has gone out of things. Gardening, reading… even my beloved chess. Nothing seems appealing anymore. Really, Doctor, are we getting anywhere? I’m not sure I have the patience for much more of this.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Schlatterer. It takes courage to share these things. Based on what you've described – the fatigue, decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, and feelings of hopelessness and disappointment – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to remember that I can’t make a diagnosis based on this conversation alone. We would need to do a more thorough evaluation. Would you be open to answering a few standardized questions, sometimes called a screening questionnaire, that can help me get a better understanding of your symptoms?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? Good heavens. Honestly, I loathe paperwork. But… if it’s absolutely necessary. I suppose I can tolerate a few questions, as long as it doesn’t take too long. But I must warn you, Doctor, I have a very low tolerance for bureaucratic exercises. And I reserve the right to terminate the process at any moment. Quickly, please. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your frustration. It won’t be extensive, I assure you, and it’s to help us understand what’s going on. Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: “Bothered”? What a strange word. Well, if you must know… almost constantly. It’s not a case of being “bothered”, Doctor, it’s a case of… an utter lack of enjoyment. Everything feels… flat. Colorless. I used to find immense pleasure in so many things, but now… nothing. It's a constant state of… apathy. I suppose that qualifies as “almost constantly”. Though, frankly, I find the entire exercise rather demeaning.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. And I apologize if it feels demeaning. We’re trying to get a more objective picture, and sometimes questionnaires can help with that. Next question: How often have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Down, depressed, or hopeless… It’s a difficult question. It’s not a sudden, dramatic feeling, Doctor. It’s more… a persistent undercurrent. A sense of… futility. The world feels… bleak. As for “often”… I suppose I would say… several days. Not every day, but… frequently. It’s not something I readily discuss, you understand. It’s… unbecoming. But you asked. Now, can we please be finished with this ordeal? My luncheon appointment is fast approaching.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. I appreciate your honesty. One more question, and then we’ll be done with the questionnaire. How often have you had trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Trouble falling asleep… staying asleep… It's a constant battle, Doctor. I toss and turn for hours, my mind racing. Then I wake up in the middle of the night, unable to drift back to sleep. And even when I do manage to sleep, it’s rarely restful. It's a fragmented, unsatisfying experience. As for sleeping too much… no, thankfully not. I wouldn’t have the energy. So, “trouble falling or staying asleep” – very often. An almost nightly occurrence. Honestly, I believe that's enough of this interrogation. Can we move on to… whatever it is you do next? Perhaps a prescription?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. That’s very helpful. Based on your responses to the questionnaire, as well as our conversation today, it does seem like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. However, it’s important to rule out any other potential medical causes for your symptoms. I'd like to recommend a blood test to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels, as these can sometimes mimic symptoms of depression. I’d also like to discuss some treatment options with you. These could include psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both. Would you be open to pursuing these options?
PATIENT: A blood test? More bureaucracy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m hardly a medical mystery. I’m a tired, disillusioned man. It seems rather… excessive. As for “treatment options”… psychotherapy sounds… unpleasant. And medication… I’m not keen on the idea of being drugged. Though, I suppose I’m not entirely opposed to something being done. But I must warn you, I have a very low tolerance for side effects. And I’m not interested in being subjected to endless rounds of therapy. I simply want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? Perhaps a simple pill? Something quick and effective? But I insist on knowing everything about potential side effects before I agree to anything. And I reserve the right to terminate the treatment at any moment. It’s rather… inconvenient, you see. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schlatterer. You’re right to ask questions and express your hesitations. A blood test is really just to rule out other possible medical issues that could be contributing to your symptoms – it’s a standard part of the evaluation process. As for treatment, there are many different medications available, and we can certainly discuss options with minimal side effects. We can start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. Psychotherapy can be very effective, but it's not the only option. We can explore that if medication isn't enough. Would you be willing to consider starting with a trial of a low-dose antidepressant?
PATIENT: A trial… you say? As in, an experiment? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a guinea pig. But… I suppose I’m at the end of my rope. A low dose… that sounds… marginally acceptable. But I want assurances. What are the potential side effects? What if it doesn’t work? And what if it makes things worse? I need a very clear explanation, Doctor. And I want to know how long I’ll be on it. And what happens if I decide to stop taking it? I have a luncheon appointment, you see. I can’t simply abandon my social obligations because of some… medical experiment. And I insist on a very detailed plan. It’s rather… unsettling, you see. I’m not accustomed to being subjected to such… procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s not an experiment, but a carefully considered treatment plan tailored to your needs. We monitor you closely throughout the process, and we can adjust or stop the medication at any time if needed. The most common side effects of antidepressants are typically mild and temporary, such as nausea, fatigue, or changes in appetite. Some people experience sexual side effects, but these can often be managed with dosage adjustments or medication changes. More serious side effects are rare, but we will discuss those as well. If the medication doesn’t work, we can try a different one, or explore other treatment options. If it makes things worse, we’ll stop it immediately. The duration of treatment varies from person to person. Many people benefit from continuing medication for several months after their symptoms have improved to prevent relapse. We can discuss a plan that works for you. One common antidepressant with relatively few side effects is Sertraline. Would you be comfortable starting with a low dose of 25mg daily?
PATIENT: Sertraline… it sounds… rather ominous. But… 25mg… that sounds… manageable. A low dose, you say? Very well. But I insist on a written list of all potential side effects, including the rare ones. And I want your direct contact information, in case of emergency. And I want to know exactly what I should do if I experience any adverse reactions. And I want a follow-up appointment scheduled immediately, to monitor my progress. And I insist on a guarantee. A guarantee that this will not interfere with my luncheon appointments. Honestly, Doctor, I’m putting a great deal of trust in you. And I expect to be treated with the utmost respect and care. And I reserve the right to terminate the treatment at any moment. It’s rather… unsettling, you see. And I must warn you, I have a very low tolerance for incompetence. Now, can we please get this over with? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. Here's a detailed information sheet outlining potential side effects, both common and rare. I've also included my direct contact information for any questions or concerns. We will schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to monitor your progress and address any side effects. I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have. We will start with 25mg daily, and you should begin to feel some improvement within 4-6 weeks. Please remember that it’s important to be patient and consistent with the medication. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all… for now. Though, I expect you to be prepared for a detailed report at my follow-up appointment. And I insist on a prompt response to any questions I may have. And I must warn you, I have a very active mind. I’m likely to have many questions. And I reserve the right to seek a second opinion if I’m not satisfied with your care. Well, Doctor, I suppose we shall see. I wish you a good day. And I trust you will not waste my time unnecessarily. And please, be mindful of my luncheon appointments. .
