DOCTOR: Hello Velda, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Lahn. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some medical information from my doctor. Just a standard thing, I believe. I’ve never been on a cruise before, so I want to be sure everything is in order.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you to get everything checked out beforehand – a first cruise is exciting! So, it sounds like this is mostly for cruise line documentation, but is there anything specific you are concerned about, or any health issues you’d like me to address while we’re at it?
PATIENT: Well, that's very kind of you to ask. Honestly, no, not particularly. I’ve generally been quite well, touch wood. I had a bit of a cold earlier in the spring, but that cleared up completely. My late husband, God rest him, always said I was as sturdy as an old Scottish oak. I suppose I just want to make certain they have a complete picture, should anything unexpected arise.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and I’m glad you’re generally feeling well. It’s always best to be prepared. And being “sturdy as an old Scottish oak” is a wonderful compliment! Let's get some details down just to have a comprehensive record. To start, can you tell me about any past medical problems you’ve had – anything that’s been diagnosed or treated previously?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… Now, I had my tonsils removed when I was a young girl, perhaps seven or eight years of age. It was quite the ordeal back then, though I barely remember it. And I broke my wrist when I was about ten, falling from a tree – a rather clumsy incident, really. Apart from those two things, and the usual childhood illnesses, I haven’t had much in the way of serious medical trouble. I did have a bout of the flu several years ago, but that was nothing a good rest and plenty of fluids couldn’t fix. Oh, and I wore glasses since I was thirty, if that's of any consequence.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed in childhood, broken wrist, a bout of flu, and wearing glasses since age thirty – that's helpful, thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the tonsils. Nothing else at all, thankfully. I’ve always been rather lucky, I suppose – or perhaps my mother’s good genes! I always avoided operations if I could, and have only ever been in hospital for that one procedure, and a few days after my husband passed, but that wasn’t for any illness, you understand. Just… needing a bit of care.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no other surgeries. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been a very difficult time. Let’s move on to family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: That's very thoughtful of you to ask, Doctor. My father, he passed away from a heart condition when he was in his early seventies, I believe it was congestive heart failure. And my mother, she had arthritis in her later years, quite debilitating it was. She was a very active woman, so it slowed her down terribly. I have one brother, and he’s perfectly healthy as far as I know, though we don’t see each other as often as we should. As for cancer, thankfully, no one on either side of the family has ever been diagnosed with it, touch wood again.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with congestive heart failure, mother with arthritis, brother in good health. Good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m very fortunate in that regard as well. I haven’t any allergies at all. I can eat anything, thankfully, and have never had a reaction to any medication. I've been stung by a bee or two in my garden over the years, but nothing more than a bit of local swelling. I always thought I was remarkably resilient, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: That is wonderful. No allergies is certainly a good thing. And resilience is definitely a valuable trait. Finally, let's talk about current medications. Are you taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t take a single pill or tablet. I believe in a good diet, regular exercise – a bit of gardening keeps me active – and a healthy dose of common sense. Though I do enjoy a cup of chamomile tea before bed, if that counts! But that’s purely for relaxation, you understand, not for any medicinal purpose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No medications, just good habits and chamomile tea! That’s wonderful to hear. Alright, just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline reading and make sure everything is as you say. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly fine. I have no objections at all. I’m quite happy to have a look over, if it puts my mind at ease, and will certainly allow you to write a proper report for the cruise line. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's start with your height and weight, just to confirm. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. We'll just do a brief abdominal exam and check your reflexes as well. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I’m quite happy to cooperate. I’ve always been rather methodical, and I appreciate a thorough approach. Lead the way, and I shall follow your instructions. I trust you’ll tell me if anything seems amiss?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. First, if you could step onto the scale for me, please. Thank you. And your height, if you wouldn’t mind?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we are. I believe I'm five foot seven inches tall, or one hundred and seventy-one centimetres, if you prefer the metric system. My husband always said I was rather tall for a Scottish lass.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 128/78, which is excellent. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look good, and your throat is clear as well. No swelling or redness. Everything sounds and looks good so far. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities detected. And your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything appears to be in good order, Velda. You are indeed in good health, as you say.
PATIENT: Oh, that's very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I do appreciate your thoroughness. It’s good to have confirmation, especially before a long journey like a cruise. I’m delighted to know everything is “in good order,” as you say. What happens now? Will you be writing a report for the cruise line?
DOCTOR: Yes, I will absolutely put together a report for the cruise line outlining your medical history, physical exam findings – everything we discussed today, and confirm that you are medically cleared for travel. It will take me a few minutes to compile everything. Do you have any specific concerns you’d like me to include in the report?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just a straightforward confirmation of my good health would be perfectly adequate. Perhaps a mention of the lack of allergies might be helpful, just for peace of mind? Otherwise, I’m happy for you to summarise everything as you see fit. You seem to have a very good grasp of the situation already.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, I’ve finished the report. It includes all of your medical history, the physical exam findings we discussed, confirmation of no allergies, and a statement that you are medically cleared for travel. Here you are. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions about the report, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Thank you very much, Doctor. Yes, this looks perfectly accurate, everything is as it should be. I appreciate you being so thorough. No, I don’t think I have any further questions. You’ve been most helpful, and have certainly put my mind at ease before my cruise. Is there anything I need to do now, or any follow-up appointments I should schedule?
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could help, Velda. No, there’s no need for any follow-up appointments unless something changes. Just enjoy your cruise and have a wonderful time! If you do experience any concerning symptoms while traveling, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. I’ll also provide you with a copy of this report for your records. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's everything. You've been remarkably kind and thorough, and I truly appreciate your attention. Having a copy for my records is excellent, thank you. I feel very confident now, and am looking forward to my cruise even more. I shall be sure to recommend your practice to my friends, should they ever need a good doctor. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You are very kind to say so, Velda. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I hope you have a truly wonderful time on your cruise! Don't hesitate to contact us if you need anything in the future. Take care and safe travels!
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Lahn. Thank you again for your time and attention. Goodbye, and I wish you a very good day.
