DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now and it's really starting to bother me. It's hard to concentrate with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. We call that tinnitus. “A bit now”… can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three weeks ago? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But the last week it’s been pretty much all the time. It's like a high-pitched whine, mostly in my right ear.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… predominantly in the right ear, and a high-pitched whine. Has anything specific triggered it, do you recall?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… honestly, not really. I work at a restaurant, it can get pretty noisy there, so maybe that? I don’t usually wear earplugs or anything. And I did go to a concert a month or so ago, but that was before it started. I'm trying to think if anything else… nope, nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: A restaurant… consistently exposed to loud noise, and a concert recently. Right. And you haven’t noticed any hearing loss along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything sounds normal, if that makes sense. Maybe a little muffled sometimes after a really busy shift, but that always goes away pretty quick. It's mostly just the ringing that’s the problem. It keeps me up at night too.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. No dizziness, no pain, no headaches… just the ringing. I feel a little tired sometimes, but that's probably just from work, you know? Long hours on my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your ears, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs just to get a general baseline. Then we'll do a few quick tests to check your hearing. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Sounds good to me, Doctor. Let’s get it over with. I've got a shift later.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please sit here, and I’ll be right with you. Just lean back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks. I'm trying to relax, but this ringing isn't making it easy.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic membrane looks normal. No obvious signs of infection or blockage. Left ear also appears normal. Heart rate and rhythm are regular. Lungs are clear. Okay, everything sounds normal physically, but we still need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to perform a quick audiometry test. It's just headphones and some beeps, nothing painful. We'll see if we can pinpoint the extent of any potential hearing loss.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Headphones and beeps, I can handle that. Let's get it done. I just want to know what's causing this ringing. It’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to put these headphones on you. When you hear a beep, press the button. Try to ignore any background noise, and just focus on the beeps. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Ready?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’m ready. Let’s do it. Just tell me when to press the button.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just press the button every time you hear a beep, no matter how faint. ...Good... good... Now, a slightly higher pitch...
PATIENT: ...There... There it is again... ...Now... nothing... nothing... Okay, I think I got it. It’s hard to tell sometimes with all the… everything going on in my head.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. Let's see… Okay, well, the results show mild high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear. Not significant, but it's there. Combined with your exposure to noise at work, and the concert, it’s likely that’s contributing to the tinnitus. Now, tinnitus isn’t usually a sign of a serious problem, but it can be very bothersome.
PATIENT: Okay, mild hearing loss... that explains something, I guess. So, the ringing is from the noise? Is there anything I can do about it? I really need to be able to hear at work. I don't want to lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: It’s likely the noise is a major factor, yes. Unfortunately, there’s no magic cure for tinnitus. But there are things we can do to manage it. First, protection is key. You need to wear earplugs at work, even if they’re just foam ones, to protect your hearing from further damage. And avoid loud noises whenever possible. We can also explore tinnitus retraining therapy, which can help you learn to cope with the sound. It takes time and commitment, but it can be effective. We can start with the earplugs and see if that makes a difference. I'm going to write you a prescription for some vitamin B12. Sometimes a deficiency can worsen tinnitus. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but it's worth trying.
PATIENT: Okay, earplugs... vitamin B12... I can do that. I guess. So, like, just wear the earplugs all the time at work? Even during slow periods? And will the vitamin B12 make me feel weird or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, consistently at work, even during slower periods. Better to be safe than sorry. As for the vitamin B12… some people experience mild side effects, like nausea, but it’s usually well-tolerated. If you do experience any adverse effects, stop taking it and let me know. I'll also give you a referral to an audiologist. They can provide you with more specialized hearing protection and guidance on tinnitus management. Now, it’s important to remember that tinnitus can sometimes be a symptom of more serious underlying conditions, although that’s less likely given your physical exam and hearing test results. If the ringing worsens suddenly, or you develop dizziness, headache, or hearing loss, you need to see me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. I understand. Earplugs all the time, vitamin B12, see an audiologist… and watch out for dizziness or headaches. It's a lot to take in, but… better to be careful. So, I guess this means I shouldn’t go to any more concerts?
DOCTOR: Ideally, yes. Concerts are extremely damaging to your hearing. If you absolutely must go, wear high-quality earplugs specifically designed for concerts. There are some good ones on the market that filter out noise without completely muffling the sound. But honestly, avoiding them altogether is the best course of action. Here's the referral to the audiologist, and your prescription for the vitamin B12. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about tinnitus and hearing protection. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It's still worrying, but… at least I know what's going on and what I can do. I should probably go get these earplugs ordered. And schedule that appointment with the audiologist. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. And do protect your hearing. Have a good day. .
