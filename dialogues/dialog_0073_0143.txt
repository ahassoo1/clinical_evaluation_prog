DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well… it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. Something about… getting ready for a baby? My friend, he told me I should come. He said it was… important. I don't really remember all the details, though. It was a long time ago when we talked about it.
DOCTOR: Getting ready for a baby… right. And you're 66 years old, Mr. Verrall. Just to clarify, are you and your… friend… planning to have a child?
PATIENT: Sixty-six… is it? Time… it goes fast. Oh. My friend… yes, that's right. We are… thinking about it. Maybe. It’s… a big step, isn’t it? I'm not sure if it's a good idea, to be honest. He thinks it would be nice. I just want to make sure… everything is okay first. If that makes sense. I don’t want to… cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Verrall, it is a rather…unusual situation. Let's start with some basics. Have you been with your friend for a long time?
PATIENT: A long time… hmm. I think so. Years, definitely. It’s… difficult to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. We met… at a cafe, I think? Or maybe a market? He’s a good man, very kind. We just… fell into it, you know? Things happened slowly. I don't really keep track of dates much. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Dates are helpful, Mr. Verrall, but we can work around it. Let's talk about your current health. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. I feel… okay. A little tired sometimes, maybe. But that’s just getting older, I think. My back aches a bit, but everyone my age has a bad back. Nothing serious, I don't think. I eat… when I can. Mostly bread and… cheese. And tea. Lots of tea. Do you want to know about my friend’s health? Maybe he has symptoms.
DOCTOR: We’ll get to your friend later, Mr. Verrall. Right now, I need to assess your health. You mentioned some fatigue and back pain. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm… I don't think so. Maybe a little… bigger? The pants feel tighter, perhaps. I haven’t really been keeping track. It's hard to say for sure. I used to be a bit slimmer… but that was a long time ago. Is it important if my weight has changed? I just don’t understand why it matters so much. It's… all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: It’s important because weight changes can indicate underlying health issues. And, Mr. Verrall, your blood pressure is a bit elevated—148 over 92. I'm also noting a slightly irregular heartbeat. Do you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not really. Sometimes… a little flutter in my chest, maybe. But it doesn't hurt. Shortness of breath… sometimes when I walk up the stairs. But I just thought that was…old age again! I’m not very good with these things, Doctor. It’s all a bit scary to hear. Elevated… irregular… what does that mean? Is it bad? I’m getting worried now. Is this something to do with… the baby?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions about the baby, Mr. Verrall. These symptoms—the fatigue, the back pain, the blood pressure, the irregular heartbeat—could be related to a number of things. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart function. And, given your age and potential for underlying issues, I’d also like to schedule a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… lots of tests. Chest X-ray… that sounds…serious. I don't like the sound of it. But… if you think it's important, Doctor, then alright. I trust your judgement. My friend… he always says I worry too much. But it’s hard not to worry when they say things like that! Will the tests take long? And will they… hurt? I’m a bit nervous now, you see. And… about the results? Will you tell me everything?
DOCTOR: The tests are standard procedure, Mr. Verrall. The blood work will take a few days to process. The EKG is quick and painless—it involves placing electrodes on your chest. The chest X-ray is also relatively quick, and the discomfort is minimal. And yes, of course, I will explain the results to you in detail. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have everything back. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and try to get some rest. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I haven't taken many medicines in my life. Just… a bit of something for my back when it really hurts. But I can’t remember what it was called. It was… a small blue pill, maybe? Or white? My memory… it's just terrible. No, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I'm more worried about… the strain. Strenuous activity? I mostly just sit and drink tea. Is that strenuous? This is all very confusing, Doctor. I just wanted to get ready for the baby… I didn't expect all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. We’ll proceed cautiously. I'm going to order the tests I mentioned, and we’ll take it from there. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid any sudden exertion, even sitting for long periods can sometimes cause issues. Now, let’s talk about your friend. What is his role in this potential… family planning?
PATIENT: My friend… he's very supportive. He's the one who suggested it, actually. He thinks it would be a wonderful thing. He... he wants a family. He's a good man, very kind. We've been together a long time, like I said. He does most of the housework, I'm not very good at it. And he cooks. He's always looking after me. He’s… everything, really. He wants to be a father. Is that… normal, at our age? He just seems so happy about it, and I don't want to disappoint him.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, Mr. Verrall, while it’s not typical, it’s not impossible. However, as we discussed, there are several health considerations we need to address first. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests completed. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
