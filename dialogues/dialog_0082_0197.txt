DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to San Sciarrotta clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or taxi work. I just want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I don’t want any trouble with that. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: Yes, San, that’s something we can certainly help with. It's a medical evaluation to ensure you’re fit to drive commercially, or in this case, for ride-sharing services. It’s good you’re being proactive about it. It involves a basic physical exam and going over your medical history. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Well, I’m 70, as you can see. I think I’m in pretty good shape for my age. I used to work… logging equipment, you know? Pretty physical job. I don’t do that anymore, obviously. I have a little arthritis in my hands, but it doesn’t bother me too much. I walk every day, try to stay active. And I eat okay, mostly. I had my gallbladder out a few years back, and I take a little medicine for my blood pressure. Medicare covers that. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, San. Arthritis, gallbladder removal, and blood pressure medication… good to know. Can you recall approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was… 2018, I believe. Yes, 2018. November, I think. It was right before Thanksgiving. My daughter was visiting, and she took me to the hospital. Good girl, that one. It was laparoscopic, so I recovered pretty quickly. Not a lot of pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2018, laparoscopic gallbladder removal. That’s good information. And what medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning with my breakfast. I haven't changed the dosage in… oh, goodness, maybe five years? The doctor just keeps refilling it. It seems to be working alright, as far as I can tell. My husband used to check it all the time, but… well, that’s a story for another day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Thank you, San. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She wasn't wrong! No allergies to penicillin or any of those common things either. I’ve had all my shots, you know, tetanus and everything. I’m pretty durable, I think.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any serious medical conditions – things like heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No heart problems, no. My father had a bit of angina, but I haven’t had any chest pain or anything like that. No lung disease, either. I smoked for a little while when I was younger, but I quit about… forty years ago. And no diabetes. I get my blood sugar checked when I see my regular doctor, and it's always fine. Neurological issues… no, not that I'm aware of. I had a bad fall last year, twisted my ankle, but that healed up okay. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a twisted ankle doesn't count, San. We're looking for more significant conditions. So, no heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes. You mentioned the fall…did you lose consciousness at all during that fall, or have any headaches or memory problems afterward?
PATIENT: No, I didn’t lose consciousness. It just… really hurt! I landed awkwardly and twisted it pretty bad. No headaches either, thankfully. And no memory problems. I remember everything perfectly, I always have. My daughter was worried, of course. She always worries. But I was fine. Just a bit bruised and shaken up. It took a few weeks to heal, but the physical therapist was good. Very good.
DOCTOR: Good. No loss of consciousness, no headaches, no memory problems after the fall. That's reassuring. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No, none of those. No chest pain at all. I can breathe just fine, maybe a little winded when I climb the stairs, but that’s just because I’m getting older! No dizziness either. And my vision is… okay. Not perfect, I need glasses, as you can see. But it hasn’t gotten any worse recently. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago, and the doctor said it was just normal age-related changes. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, San, that’s very helpful. No chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or recent changes in vision. Now, before we proceed to a quick physical exam, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me see. My mother lived to be 92, very healthy woman. She died in her sleep, peacefully. My father, he had a bit of angina, as I mentioned, and he died from a heart attack when he was in his 70s. My brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. And my sister… she had arthritis, pretty bad in her hands. So, you know, the usual. Heart problems, high blood pressure, arthritis… Nothing too serious, as far as I know. Just the typical old-age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems, high blood pressure, arthritis in the family. Thank you, San. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don't mind. I’ve had plenty of check-ups in my life. Just try to be quick, if you could. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. I’ll be as quick as possible. If you could just sit here on the table for me, that would be great. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to check your pulse. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s do a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There. Is that okay? It’s a little hard with these glasses, but I’m trying my best. Don’t worry, my eyesight isn’t that bad. I used to be able to thread a needle without glasses, you know. Those were the days…
DOCTOR: Very good, San. You’re doing great. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too tight? I don’t want to break anything. I used to have very strong hands, from working the logging equipment. They’re not as strong as they used to be, but they still work.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, San. Good grip strength. Now, can you lift each of your legs, one at a time?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? My hip gets a little stiff sometimes, especially in the morning. It doesn't bother me too much, but it's a little harder to lift my legs. I should probably do more stretching, my daughter keeps telling me. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, good range of motion, slight stiffness noted. And finally, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. How’s that? A little wobbly, maybe, but I’m not falling over. I used to be able to walk for miles without getting tired. But that was a long time ago. Is that enough walking? I don't want to wear myself out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, San. Thank you. Based on my examination, your vital signs are slightly elevated blood pressure, but otherwise your physical exam is stable. Your neurological function is intact, and you have good strength and range of motion. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve checked everything pretty thoroughly. I suppose… will this card allow me to drive for Uber? That’s all I really need to know. Is there anything else I need to do? Any more tests? I really just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Based on the information we've gathered today, and acknowledging your report of no significant symptoms, I can provide a medical certification stating you are fit to drive commercially. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. I recommend following up with your primary care physician to monitor it and discuss potential management strategies. To be completely thorough, and given your age, I would also suggest a basic electrocardiogram to assess your heart function, just as a precaution. It’s a simple, painless test. Would you be comfortable scheduling an ECG with your primary care physician, and scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in three months to re-evaluate your blood pressure?
PATIENT: An ECG… Is that really necessary? I feel fine. And another appointment… I just want to get this card and get on with things. I don't want to be going back and forth to doctors all the time. But… if you think it’s really important, I suppose I can ask my doctor about the ECG. I don't want to cause any trouble. Three months seems like a long time to wait, though. Is that absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, San. An ECG isn’t strictly required, but it provides an extra layer of safety and reassurance, especially given your blood pressure reading. It helps us ensure there are no underlying heart conditions that could affect your ability to drive safely. As for the three-month follow-up, that’s a standard recommendation for monitoring blood pressure. We want to make sure it remains stable. However, we can shorten that to two months if you prefer. I can provide the medical certification for your ride-sharing application with a note indicating the slightly elevated blood pressure and the recommendation for a follow-up with your primary care physician for blood pressure management and an ECG. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Two months sounds better. Much better. And… a note on the card? Will that cause any problems with Uber? I don’t want them to reject my application because of my blood pressure. As long as it doesn’t cause trouble, I suppose a note is alright. Just… make sure it’s not too alarming. And two months for a follow-up, you said? Okay. That sounds… reasonable. I guess. So, you can give me the card then? Finally?
DOCTOR: Yes, San. I can absolutely provide the medical certification today. I will make a note stating your blood pressure is slightly elevated and recommend follow-up with your primary care physician for ongoing management and potential ECG. It will be worded neutrally, focusing on the recommendation for monitoring rather than any specific concern. I do not anticipate this will cause any issues with Uber, but I cannot guarantee their decision. They may request additional information from your physician. Let me just finish up the paperwork. Here you are. This is the medical certification. Please keep it with you when you apply for your ride-sharing license. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to finally have this sorted out. I hope Uber doesn't give me any trouble. Well, goodbye. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Remember to schedule that follow-up appointment with your primary care physician. And if you have any concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Drive safely, and I wish you all the best with your ride-sharing endeavors. Goodbye, San.
