DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… my waterworks. They bother me. A lot. I keep getting… trouble with them. It's been happening on and off, but mostly on lately. I don't… I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Just… recently.
DOCTOR: Alright, “trouble with your waterworks.” Can you tell me a little more specifically what kind of trouble you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… That’s a hard one. It… burns, when I go. And I have to go very often. Even when I don't have much to… to get rid of. It's quite embarrassing, really. And sometimes… sometimes it just feels like it doesn’t all come out. Do you understand? I don't… I don’t know what the words are. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Claudene. It sounds quite distressing. Burning with urination, frequent urges, and a feeling of incomplete emptying – those are all important details. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how often you’re needing to urinate during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot to keep track of. Let me think. More than usual, certainly. I used to… well, I don’t know. Maybe every few hours? Now… now it feels like every hour, or even less. Sometimes I wake up in the night too, which is new. It's disruptive, you see. I'm very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a noticeable increase in frequency, including waking at night – that’s helpful. And you mentioned burning. Is the burning present every time you urinate, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not every time, no. Sometimes it's fine, and then… then it's like fire. It comes on suddenly. Not always, though. It’s very unpredictable, that's the worst part. Makes it hard to… plan things.
DOCTOR: I see. Unpredictable burning with increased frequency, including nocturia – waking at night to urinate. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, Claudene?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… now that you mention it… I think so. Just a little. Once, maybe twice. It wasn't much, just a tinge. I thought it was something I ate, maybe. I didn't pay it much mind, honestly. It went away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene, thank you for sharing that. A tinge of blood in the urine, even if it only happened once or twice, is important information. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven't felt hot, or anything. Chills… not really. Maybe a little cold sometimes, but that's just the air conditioning. Back pain… sometimes my back aches, but I'm an old woman! It’s just… old age. I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or significant back pain. And you feel the back discomfort is likely related to age. Now, have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s… a personal question. Well… no. Not for a very long time. I’ve been divorced for… oh, decades now. No, not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that, Claudene. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor… the one before… he said my pressure was a little high, once. But he gave me some pills, and it went down. I think. I don’t… I don't remember the details. And… no, I don't think I have anything else. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that was treated with medication. Do you know what medication you were prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t. I just took the pills he gave me. A little white one, I think. I don’t keep track of things like that. My daughter used to manage all that, but she… well, she moved away. I just take what the doctor gives me, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so we're unsure of the medication for blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… oh, yes. Years ago. When I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Other than that… no, not really. It was all very… routine, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. Broken wrist and gallbladder removal in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my arthritis. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think. The blue one. And sometimes a Tylenol for headaches. That’s it. I don’t take much. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for arthritis and headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don't think so. I eat everything. And I haven't had any… bad reactions to anything, that I recall. A little itching sometimes, but that's just the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my brother… he had diabetes. A bad case, I remember. Other than that… I don’t… I don’t know much about it. My family isn’t very… forthcoming with information, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene, so a family history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your brother. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t care for it. My husband used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. Horrible habit, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little wine, sometimes. With dinner. A glass, maybe two. Nothing more. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine with dinner. And finally, can you tell me a little about your typical diet and fluid intake?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Soup, mostly. And salads. I don't eat much meat anymore. As for fluids… I drink water, of course. And tea. A lot of tea. I used to drink more water, but… it’s just easier to have tea, you see. I don’t… I don't think I drink enough water, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this… trouble to go away. The sooner, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your abdomen. It’s soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Now, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It's… a bit blurry, but I can see it. I need my glasses, you see. Everything's a little fuzzy without them.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly understandable. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. And finally, I’d like to do a quick urine sample. We need to test it for infection. Do you have a clean catch sample with you or will you need to go to the restroom?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A urine sample? No, I didn't bring one. I didn't know. I can go, I suppose. It's just… the trouble is getting there, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We have a restroom right here. I’ll give you a cup and instructions for a “clean catch” sample. It’s important to try to collect a mid-stream sample to get the most accurate results. Let me know when you're finished, and I'll send it to the lab. Do you need any assistance getting to the restroom?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I can manage. It’s just… a little walk. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Doctor. It was… a bit difficult, but I managed.
PATIENT: Excellent, thank you, Claudene. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. While we’re waiting for the results, which should be back in a few days, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help with the burning and frequent urination. It's an antibiotic, just in case it is an infection.
DOCTOR: It’s called Nitrofurantoin, and you’ll take it twice a day for seven days. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. Also, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, at least six to eight glasses of water a day, while you’re taking this medication. It helps to flush out the bacteria. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Six to eight glasses? Oh dear. That's a lot of water. But… I will try. And finish all the pills? Even if I feel better? Yes, alright. I understand. What happens if… if it doesn't get better, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Claudene. If your symptoms don’t improve within a few days of starting the antibiotic, or if they get worse, it means the infection may be resistant to this particular medication, or that there may be another underlying cause. In that case, we'll need to do some further testing, possibly a urine culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, and possibly refer you to a urologist for a more in-depth evaluation. We want to make sure we get this sorted out for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Urologist? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… please, make it go away. I just want to be comfortable again. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. I understand. We’ll do everything we can. I’m going to give you a written summary of our conversation and the prescription instructions. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with us in a week to see how you’re doing.
