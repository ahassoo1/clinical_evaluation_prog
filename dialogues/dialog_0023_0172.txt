DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, dear, I haven't the foggiest. Some social worker, I presume? My husband insisted. He worries unduly, you know. New to the area, they said something about a…check-up? Really, at my age, what good will that do? It’s all rather…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. A routine check-up prompted by your husband, then. While I understand your skepticism, Ms. Engelhaupt, preventative care can be valuable at any age. It allows us to establish a baseline and address any potential issues early on. Let's proceed as though it is a check-up, shall we?
PATIENT: Baseline? Issues? My dear, I've lived a long life. I think if there were any “issues”, they’d have made themselves known by now. But very well. If you insist. Just…let’s make this swift, shall we? I have bridge at two.
DOCTOR: Very well. To start, could you tell me about any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly. A little stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. And the occasional…forgetfulness. Though that’s hardly a symptom, is it? It comes with age, naturally. It’s not as though I’m unwell. More…absent-minded, I suppose. Really, doctor, is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings and some forgetfulness. And to clarify, Ms. Engelhaupt, when you say forgetfulness, can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Specific example…? Oh dear. It's not…easy to pinpoint. Names, sometimes. Where I’ve left my spectacles. That sort of thing. It’s not… alarming. Just…irritating. And truly, I believe I told the nice woman on the phone about this already. Are you even reading my file?
DOCTOR: I am reviewing your file, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, it's important for me to gather this information directly from you to ensure clarity. Now, has this forgetfulness been worsening lately?
PATIENT: Worsening… I haven't the slightest idea. Time…it all blurs together, you know. One day bleeds into the next. Perhaps? I honestly can’t say. It’s quite bothersome being asked these trivial questions, doctor. Are you quite finished? I do have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many doctors over the years… honestly, I can't recall. Something with my… joints, perhaps? Years ago. I was very active in my youth, you see. Ballroom dancing, mostly. And a touch of… indigestion now and again, but nothing serious. Really, I’ve always been quite robust. I’m not one to dwell on ailments. It’s terribly uncouth.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think. Oh! My appendix, ages ago. And… a rather unpleasant bunion removal. It was terribly uncomfortable, I assure you. But that was… decades ago. Really, doctor, is this pertinent? My memory isn’t what it used to be. You're asking me to recall things from a lifetime ago. It’s simply exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, this information is important for building a complete picture of your health. Now, thinking about your family—your parents, siblings, or children—do they have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… My husband, bless his heart, has a touch of…nervousness, I suppose. Always worrying. My parents…oh, goodness. Long gone, both of them. My mother, a delicate constitution. Always catching colds. Father…robust, like myself. A businessman. I don't recall any…significant illnesses, no. Honestly, we didn't discuss such things. It was considered rather…indelicate, you see. Are we quite finished yet? This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Just a little something for my… digestion, occasionally. An antacid, I believe. And sometimes, a vitamin. Vitamin D, perhaps? My husband insists. He’s very keen on my taking vitamins. I honestly can’t recall the exact name. I simply take what he gives me. It all blurs together, you know. Really, doctor, is this absolutely necessary? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Let's take a moment. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few basic neurological checks. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A…physical examination? Goodness no! I haven’t the slightest desire to be poked and prodded. I came here for a…social visit, as I understand it. Not a medical inspection! I’m perfectly well, thank you very much. Really, doctor, this is quite unacceptable. I think I’ll be going now. .
