DOCTOR: Good morning, Larin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back... it’s really bad. Been hurting for a while now, but got worse this last week. It’s a sharp pain, not just a dull ache. It makes it hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp back pain that's gotten worse recently. I see. And you mentioned it's been going on for a "while now"—could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well... it started maybe six months ago? Just a little twinge, you know? Like I pulled a muscle. I didn’t think much of it, just took some rest. But then... it kept coming back. Not every day, just when I moved wrong or lifted something. Now, like I said, it’s almost always there. It’s really hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, started as a mild twinge after exertion... and it's progressed to being almost constant, interfering with sleep. I understand. And can you pinpoint where exactly on your back the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's lower back, mostly. Right in the middle. But it feels like it shoots down my leg sometimes, on the left side. Not all the way to my foot, but down the back of my thigh, you know? Like a… a hot wire.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, midline, radiating down the left thigh... a “hot wire” sensation. That's helpful. Has anything specific made it better or worse besides moving or lifting?
PATIENT: Oh… sitting. Sitting is really bad. Makes it worse fast. Standing is okay for a little bit, but not for long. Lying down... sometimes helps, if I get in the right position. And… heat. A warm bath, or a heating pad, that feels good for a little while. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting exacerbates it, lying down offers some relief in certain positions, and heat provides temporary comfort. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numbness. Sometimes my leg feels weak, but I don’t think it’s tingling. Just… like it could give out on me. That hasn’t happened yet, but it feels like it might.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness, but a feeling of weakness in the leg. Do you have any problems with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Bladder and bowels? No… everything is normal there. No trouble going to the bathroom or anything like that. Sorry if that’s a strange question!
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, it's an important question to rule things out. Good to hear those are normal. Now, a little about your history. Have you had any back injuries before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, little aches and pains over the years, from working… bending and lifting at the factory. But no big injuries, like a fall or anything. And I don't remember ever hurting my back badly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major back injuries. Have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. And...oh! I had a cyst removed from my wrist a long time ago. But that’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal as a child and a cyst removal from your wrist... good to know. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well... the doctor told me a while back I have… cancer. In my lungs. I'm getting treatment for it. That was about a year ago. It’s… it’s been pretty stable, but that’s why I get regular check-ups. I didn't think this back pain had anything to do with the cancer, but…
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me. That’s important information. It’s certainly possible the back pain is related to the cancer or the treatment. We'll need to consider that carefully. Are you currently taking any medications for your lung cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. I take… let me see… there’s a pill, Keytruda. It’s an immunotherapy drug. And then I get an infusion every few weeks. And I take a pain pill sometimes, when the cancer pain gets bad, but I haven’t needed it much lately. Just when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Keytruda immunotherapy, regular infusions, and pain medication as needed for cancer pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all kinds of food, no problems there. My mom always said I had a strong stomach!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and see if we can pinpoint the source of the pain. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s going on with my back. It's really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Larin. If you don't mind, please lie down on your back on the exam table. Okay, tell me if this is painful. Ouch, right there?
PATIENT: Yes! Right there. On the left side. That's where it hurts the most. And when you press… it feels like a sharp stab, right down my leg. Not all the time, but when you push like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness and radicular pain on the left side with palpation. Alright, now bend forward for me, as far as you can. And now backward… and to the right… and to the left. Alright, and finally, let's check your reflexes. Okay, everything seems fairly normal there. Your reflexes are intact. But there is definitely tenderness and pain with palpation on your left lower back, which is consistent with nerve irritation.
PATIENT: Nerve irritation… That sounds bad. Is that from the cancer? Or something else? It just feels like… something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Nerve irritation can have a lot of causes. It could be related to the cancer, either a direct effect of the tumor, or a side effect of the treatment. However, it could also be something else entirely, like a herniated disc or muscle strain. Given your history of lung cancer, we need to be particularly thorough in investigating this. I’d like to order an MRI of your lower back to get a better look at the nerves and discs. That will help us determine the exact cause of your pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… Yes, that sounds good. If that will tell us what’s going on, then yes, please. I just want to know. I’ve been worrying about this a lot. And… is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: An MRI is a non-invasive procedure, Larin. It doesn’t use any radiation and it shouldn’t hurt. You'll lie inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your back. It can be a little noisy, and you'll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes, but it's generally well-tolerated. I’ll write the order for the MRI now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and inflammation. We’ll discuss the results of the MRI once they are available, and then we can develop a treatment plan. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… Okay. I can try that. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me and taking this seriously. It's just… scary, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. It is scary, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious. We’re going to get to the bottom of this together. Here are the prescriptions. Please take them as directed. And if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as weakness in your legs, or loss of bowel or bladder control, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll also have my nurse give you a handout with more information about managing back pain. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. You've been very kind. I'll get the MRI scheduled as soon as I can. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Larin. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I’ll see you again once we have the MRI results. .
