DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. It gets difficult when I try to lie flat. It's been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. I just thought it would go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing when lying flat, for about a month. That’s good information to start with. Could you describe what you mean by “difficult”?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like… a weight on my chest, almost. And I have to… concentrate to get enough air. Not exactly short of breath, but… strained. It’s just… uncomfortable, and I find myself propping up with pillows to be able to sleep. It's better when I'm sitting up, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, a weight on your chest, requiring conscious effort to breathe, and improved with sitting up. That gives me a better idea. Does this happen with any activity, or is it only when lying down?
PATIENT: Only when lying down, Doctor. Walking is fine. Even climbing the stairs isn’t too bad, though I do get a little winded sometimes, but that’s just because I’m… well, seventy-one years old. It's specifically when I try to lie flat that it becomes a problem. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting, or standing, or even bending over. Just lying down.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know—specifically with lying flat. And you've noticed it for about a month now?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It started gradually, I think. I didn’t wake up one morning and suddenly couldn’t lie flat. It just… got worse over time. Now it's to the point where I really have to make an effort, and usually need those pillows. I do worry it will get even worse if I don't figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Vanderwiele. It’s good you’re addressing this now. Let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as heart problems, lung issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. And arthritis, of course. Most folks my age have some arthritis. Aside from that… no, I don't think so. No heart problems, no lung issues. And no diabetes. I had a complete check-up last year, and everything was fine then. Medicare keeps good track of things, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Controlled hypertension and arthritis. And a clean bill of health at your check-up last year is reassuring. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis, or any other reason?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, ten milligrams, I believe. And ibuprofen when my arthritis flares up. Not every day, just when I need it. And occasionally, a stool softener. You know… things slow down as you get older. That's about it, really. Nothing fancy. I keep a list in my purse, if you’d like to see it.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Thank you. Stool softener, ibuprofen as needed, and lisinopril 10mg. I do appreciate you keeping that list. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago. And I was hospitalized for pneumonia once, back in the 1980s. But other than that… no. Nothing major. A few broken bones as a child, but those healed up fine. I haven’t been in the hospital for anything in decades. I try to stay out of hospitals, if you understand. They aren't pleasant places.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand. Gallbladder removal and a case of pneumonia in the 1980s. And you’ve done a good job staying healthy since then. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or anything else that might be relevant?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And she had some trouble with her heart later in life. My father… he was mostly healthy, I think. He smoked for a long time, though. But as for anything else… not that I recall. We weren’t very close, my father and I. And my mother didn’t talk much about family history. It wasn’t something we did. I wish I knew more, honestly. It’s frustrating not to have that information.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's always helpful to have that family history. Okay, so hypertension and heart issues on your mother’s side. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not to medications, not to foods, not to anything. I’ve always been lucky that way. I can eat anything, take anything, without any trouble. My daughter is very allergic to pollen, poor thing. But me? Nothing. I’m perfectly fine. Is that… unusual? I suppose it is. Most people have something they’re allergic to.
DOCTOR: It is quite unusual, but certainly not a bad thing! Alright, no known allergies. And just to finish up this part, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My father did, as I mentioned, but I always thought it was a foolish habit. My mother didn’t approve, either. I always said, "If it wasn't good enough for your mother, it isn’t good enough for me." And I stuck to that. I do get annoyed when people smoke around me, though. I prefer fresh air. It’s important, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No history of smoking. Thank you for answering all those questions, Ms. Vanderwiele. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a general look. It shouldn’t take long. Would you please sit back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I figured you’d want to listen to my chest. It’s been bothering me, after all. I’ll sit back. Just let me adjust this paper… It’s always so cold in these examination rooms. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally for me, please. Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly. I’m hearing some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Nothing terribly concerning at this point, but something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little high today, but it can be elevated in the office. Finally, let’s just take a quick look at your throat and feel your neck. Alright. Everything else appears normal on initial examination. So, to recap: elevated heart rate, mild crackles in your lungs, and slightly elevated blood pressure in the office. Given your history and these findings, I’m concerned about a few possibilities, including fluid buildup in your lungs, which could be caused by heart issues, or possibly even pneumonia, although you don’t have any fever or other signs of infection. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray and an… EKG? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I was hoping it wasn’t going to come to that. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I suppose so. I just don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? And those machines… they always seem so big and scary. But if it will tell us what’s going on, then do what you have to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… let me know what to expect. It's just... worrisome. I really just want to be able to lie down comfortably again.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Vanderwiele, and I apologize for the added tests. You’re right to be concerned, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. The X-ray will give us a clear picture of your lungs, and the EKG will assess your heart's electrical activity. The X-ray is very quick and painless – you’ll just stand in front of a machine while a technician takes a picture. The EKG involves placing a few small stickers on your chest and arms; it doesn’t hurt at all, just takes a few minutes to record your heart rhythm. I’ll explain everything to you in more detail before each test, and the technicians will walk you through the process. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood to check your basic blood counts and kidney function, as well. This is just to get a baseline and rule out any other potential causes. The results should be back within a few hours, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to prop yourself up with pillows while you sleep, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable, I suppose. Pillows I can do. And I haven’t been doing much strenuous activity lately, anyway. Mostly just reading and watching television. Blood work… I always hate needles. But… if you need it, then I’ll get it done. Just… try to be quick, please? And… will you explain the results to me personally? I don’t want some assistant telling me bad news over the phone. I’d like to hear it from you, Doctor. And I'd like you to explain them clearly, in plain English. I don’t understand all that medical jargon. I’m trusting you to take care of this, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and what we can do to fix it. And… I really do want to be able to lie flat again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not too much to ask, Ms. Vanderwiele. And I completely understand your concerns. I promise I will personally call you to discuss the results, and I will explain everything in plain English. No jargon, I assure you. You deserve a clear explanation, and I will make sure you understand everything. And I will do everything I can to help you feel better and get you back to sleeping comfortably. That's my job. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood, and then we can schedule the chest X-ray and EKG for later today. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you, or any other questions you have?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s… everything, I suppose. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and your kindness. It’s… reassuring to know you’re taking this seriously. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, of course. Just… call me as soon as you know something, please. .
