DOCTOR: Right. Bradlee Kochubey, 38 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor... Ruocco, right? Yeah, it's about getting surgery. For… weight loss. My wife and I, we talked it over and this clinic came recommended. It's a… bariatric surgery evaluation, I think she called it? Honestly, I don't remember all the details. It's a lot.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery. Yes. Well, that’s… a decision. Look, I’m an internal medicine doctor. I don’t do the surgeries. I evaluate if you’re healthy enough for surgery, basically. A lot of people want it, few are actually good candidates. So, let’s start with the basics. How long have you been considering this?
PATIENT: Considering… wow. That’s a good question. A while, definitely. Probably… six months? Maybe longer. It feels like a long time, but things get… fuzzy. My wife really brought it up, she's been worried about my health. I just… get tired easily, you know? And things are getting harder to do. I mostly just remember her saying it was a good option, and we should look into it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Right. Well, six months is… something. Alright. And what specifically is getting harder to do?
PATIENT: Um… walking, mostly. Like, longer distances. I used to be able to walk for ages, just… stroll around. Now, I get winded pretty quick. And bending over… tying my shoes is a pain. Little things, but they add up. I also… I get tired just sitting sometimes, if that makes sense? It’s… frustrating. And my knees, they ache. A lot.
DOCTOR: Knees, fatigue, shortness of breath… Okay. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. That’s… not great. I like food, okay? A lot. My wife tries to get me to eat better, she really does. We have salads sometimes. But… I work, you know? Long days, and there's always fast food nearby. I eat a lot of… burgers and fries. And sweets. Too many sweets. I try to drink water, but I forget sometimes. I’m not… disciplined, I guess. Is that a bad thing? I honestly don’t even know what a healthy diet looks like, regularly.
DOCTOR: “Not disciplined.” Yes. That’s… a factor. Alright. Let’s not dwell on the diet right now. Have you tried any specific diets before, even for a short time?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, a couple. My wife got me to try that… keto thing? For like, a week? It was really hard. I missed bread too much. And then there was that one with all the shakes. That was okay, but I just… couldn’t keep it up. It felt like I wasn't actually eating. It was mostly just… liquid. I tried to be good, I really did, but it didn’t stick. They both just felt… temporary. I lost a little weight, but it came right back.
DOCTOR: As expected. Right. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a while, to be honest. I had… strep throat when I was a kid, maybe? And I broke my arm once, but that was years ago. My wife says I have high blood pressure, she checks it sometimes, but I don't… really know. I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything. I just… get tired a lot, like I said. Does that count? It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: "Gets tired a lot." Right. We'll check your blood pressure. And we'll need some blood work, just to get a baseline. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not regularly. I take… ibuprofen sometimes, for my knees, if they’re really bad. But that’s it. Just when I need it. And… sometimes I take something for heartburn, but that’s rare. Mostly I just try to avoid spicy food. My wife keeps telling me I should see a doctor about the heartburn, but I haven’t gotten around to it. It’s not… that bad, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen, occasional heartburn medication. And no allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always asks, and I always say no. I've never really had a reaction to anything. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but that could be anything, right? Dust, pollen… I live in the city, it’s full of stuff. I don’t think it’s an allergy. Just… itchy skin sometimes. Is that important? I'm starting to feel like I'm just rambling. I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: Rambling is a fair assessment. Alright. Let’s get a physical exam done. Just a basic check. It’ll give us a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Please, have a seat on the examination table. And try to… focus. This is important.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Focusing… I’ll try. It’s just… a lot to remember. Is there a weight limit on this thing? I… might be a little over the average. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one… Good. Your breathing sounds a little… congested. I'll listen to your heart now. A bit fast, but not alarming. Blood pressure is… 150 over 90. Your wife was right to be concerned. Okay, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay… congested, fast heartbeat… and high blood pressure. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Reflexes… what do you do for that? Do you… hit my knees with something? My wife always used to do that when I was a kid, but I don't remember what it was for. It always made me jump. I just… want to feel better, you know? This whole thing is a little scary.
DOCTOR: It's a standard neurological check. We're just assessing nerve function. It's not painful. Left leg… good. Right leg… good. A little diminished, but not concerning. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Not painful... just a little jumpy. Um… a little. Right there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It comes and goes, usually after I eat something heavy. My wife says it might be indigestion, but… I don’t know. It’s just… there. Sometimes. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Probably just indigestion, as your wife suggested. Nothing significant. Alright. Based on this preliminary examination, your blood pressure is elevated, and your breathing is a bit congested. We need to run some blood work to rule out any underlying conditions. And I strongly recommend you consult a cardiologist. I’ll order a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. And a referral to a cardiologist… and perhaps a gastroenterologist, given your… abdominal discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay… lots of tests. Blood work, cardiologist, gastroenterologist… That’s… a lot. Is it… bad? Is something seriously wrong? I just want to lose some weight and feel better, not… have a bunch of problems. I'm starting to regret even looking into this. My wife will be so worried. I wish I hadn't come. It's just getting more complicated.
DOCTOR: Look, it's not a matter of “something being seriously wrong” yet. It's a matter of being thorough. You want bariatric surgery, correct?
PATIENT: Yes… I do. But… if it's going to be this much trouble… maybe I should just forget about it. It's just… it feels like every step I take makes things worse, not better. My wife wanted me to do this, but I don't want to worry her. She's already stressed enough. Maybe I should just try to eat less. Even though I'm not very good at it. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I understand your concerns. But neglecting your health won't make things better. I'll order the tests, you get the referrals. We'll reassess after we have the results. Here's the lab requisition and the cardiologist's information. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
