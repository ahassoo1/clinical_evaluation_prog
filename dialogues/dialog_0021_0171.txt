DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Welcome. I’m Dr. Havird. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's… my nails. They just look… funny. Not good funny. I don’t really… remember how they got like this, just that they are. I noticed it a few weeks ago, maybe? It's hard to keep track. They're not hurting or anything, just… different.
DOCTOR: Different how, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. Like… the color is off. They’re not… pink, like they should be. More… yellowish? And kinda thick, I guess. Not broken, just… not nice. I don't paint them or anything, so it's not polish. Honestly, I don’t know what it is. I just know they look… old lady nails. Not a good look, trust me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in the texture of your skin around the nails?
PATIENT: Texture? Around them…? Hmm. I don't think so. It feels… normal. Maybe a little dry, but I always have dry skin. It’s just… dry. Not anything special. I put lotion on sometimes, if I remember. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any trouble with… any fungal infections before?
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh, goodness no! I keep myself clean, thank you very much. I don’t go around getting… fungus. That’s… awful. I don’t even know what you mean. Is that what you think it is? It doesn’t look like fungus. It looks like… bad nails.
DOCTOR: Well, it can look like a lot of things, Ms. Thut. It's just a question I need to ask. Let’s move on. Any joint pain?
PATIENT: Joint pain? Oh, you know, a little. Getting old, I guess. My knees creak sometimes when I stand up, but everyone’s knees creak. It's not pain, exactly. More like… complaining. It's just… age. I don't take anything for it. It’s just old lady stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you having any difficulty breathing, or any fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Well, I get tired, of course. I’m not a young woman anymore! But… not more tired than usual. I sleep okay, most nights. Sometimes I wake up, but who doesn’t? I wouldn’t say I’m… difficult breathing or anything. Is something wrong? Are you thinking it's something serious?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Thut, I’m trying to get a complete picture here. Let me just take a look at your nails, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be gentle, alright? I don't like anyone messing with my hands. They're my hands, you know. I need them.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, they are quite thickened and discolored. It could be a fungal infection, but it's not definitive. I’m also noting some slight pitting on a few of them. I'd like to send a sample to the lab to confirm. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Lab? Send a sample? Like… cut a piece off? No! Absolutely not! I don’t want anyone cutting my nails! I just want them to look normal again, not… dissected. Is there anything else you can do? A cream, maybe? Something simple? I really don't like the sound of a lab.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, a definitive diagnosis is important to ensure we’re treating the correct issue. Without knowing what's causing this, any treatment I suggest would be guesswork. A simple cream won’t necessarily solve the problem, and could even make it worse if it's not the right kind. The lab test is a small scraping—it doesn’t involve cutting anything off. It’s a very common procedure. But if you absolutely refuse… ...we can try an over-the-counter antifungal cream for a few weeks and see if there's any improvement. But I must advise you that this isn't the ideal approach.
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… that sounds better. As long as you aren't taking anything off of me. What kind of cream? And where do I get it? Is it expensive? I'm on Medicare, you know. I don’t have money to waste on things that don't work. And… how long do I have to put it on?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a prescription for clotrimazole cream. You can get it at most pharmacies. It’s a relatively inexpensive over-the-counter medication, and Medicare should cover a portion of the cost. Apply a thin layer to each affected nail twice daily after washing and drying your hands. You’ll need to use it consistently for at least six to twelve months. It takes a long time for the cream to penetrate the nail and reach the infection. Consistency is key, Ms. Thut. And if you don’t see any improvement after three months, you need to come back in so we can discuss further options, including the lab test. Understood?
PATIENT: Six to twelve months?! That’s… a long time. And what if it doesn’t work? Fine. I’ll try the cream. But if it doesn’t work after three months, I’m not coming back. And I’m definitely not letting anyone take a piece of my nail. Thank you, I guess. I hope this works. I just want my nails to look normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns, you can call the clinic. Have a good day, Ms. Thut.
