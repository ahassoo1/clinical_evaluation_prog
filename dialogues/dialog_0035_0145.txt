DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here because I need to… how you say… get papers signed so someone can help me at home. My daughter, she thinks I need a little help, and this is for that, yes? For the home health, the hospice… eligibility, I believe it is called.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here – paperwork for home health services. Okay. So, just to clarify, it sounds like your daughter is concerned about you needing some assistance at home, and we're completing some forms to explore those options. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. She worries… a lot. And I do not mind a little help, if it is needed. I have been… slower, lately. It is hard to explain. It is not pain, exactly. Just… things take longer. And I forget things sometimes, but not always! It is very strange. But yes, the papers. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. To get started, let's talk a little bit about this “slower” feeling and the forgetfulness. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It began… perhaps six months ago? Maybe seven. It was very gradual. At first, I thought it was just… being tired. I had a busy practice for many years, you know. Pediatric surgery is… demanding. But it has continued, even after I retired. It started with small things. Misplacing my keys, forgetting appointments. Now… now it is more than that. I sometimes have trouble finding the right words. Or remembering what I was saying mid-sentence. It is… frustrating. And my daughter, she gets very worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six to seven months ago, you started noticing some changes in your memory and concentration, even after you retired. You mentioned difficulty with word-finding and remembering things mid-sentence. Has this been impacting your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… difficult to cook now. I used to enjoy it very much, but I forget ingredients, or I leave things on the stove. Not dangerous things, yet. But I worry about it. And I used to read a lot. Now, I find it hard to concentrate. I read a page, and then I have to go back and read it again because I do not remember what I just read. And driving… my daughter does not like me to drive anymore. She says I seem… distracted. She is probably right. It is very unsettling, Doctor. I do not like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like these changes are causing you some real concern, and it’s good that your daughter is being attentive. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what is happening. A physical exam… yes. I have no objections. Ask me anything you need to. And… is this about my mind? Am I… losing my mind, Doctor? I apologize for asking so directly, but it is what I worry about most.
DOCTOR: It’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Bahta, and it's good that you're being honest about your concerns. We're going to gather some information to try and understand what's happening. It could be related to changes in memory, but there are many reasons why someone might experience these symptoms. We need to rule out other possibilities first, such as vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or other medical conditions. Before we do the exam, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was young, of course. And I broke my arm once, playing football. Nothing serious. For the most part, I have been very healthy, actually. High blood pressure, for a few years, but it is controlled with medication. And… I had a bout of pneumonia last winter. That was unpleasant. But otherwise, no. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the blood pressure, and the pneumonia. I take a pill for the blood pressure every morning. And sometimes, I take something for allergies, if the pollen is bad. That is all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal as a child, broken arm, high blood pressure controlled with medication, and pneumonia last winter. You also take medication for allergies as needed. Do you know the names of the medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. The blood pressure pill is… Lisinopril, I believe. And the allergy medicine is… Cetirizine. I have been taking them for several years now. Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Cetirizine, for the allergies. I keep them in the kitchen cabinet, in a little box. My daughter reminds me to take them every day. She is very good about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My daughter asked me that question recently, and I thought about it very carefully. I have never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication, without any problems. I have always been lucky in that regard. No allergies. I am quite certain.
DOCTOR: Good. That's good to know. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any instances of memory loss or neurological conditions – like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s – in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had some problems with her memory, towards the end of her life. But it was old age, mostly. She was very old. And my uncle… on my father’s side… he had tremors, I believe. But I do not know what it was. It was a long time ago. My father did not talk about it much. So, yes, perhaps some memory problems, and some tremors. But nothing definite. It is hard to say. My daughter, she is very concerned about Alzheimer’s, of course. She reads a lot about it. But I do not know if it runs in the family. It is all very vague.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some possible memory issues in your mother and tremors in an uncle. It’s good to be aware of those possibilities. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never. I do not drink alcohol. I do not smoke. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I have always been a very… temperate person. I prefer tea, actually. And I eat a healthy diet, mostly. My daughter makes sure of that. She is always telling me to eat more vegetables. So, no, I do not have any unhealthy habits. At least, not that I know of. I try to be healthy, for my daughter’s sake, if nothing else.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. It sounds like you take good care of yourself. Alright, Mr. Bahta, now I’d like to do a quick physical and neurological exam. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple tests to assess your memory, balance, and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I am ready. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… memory tests. Do whatever you think is necessary. Let us get this sorted out. I just want to know what is happening. And… please, be honest with me. I do not want any sugarcoating. I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Bahta. I will be as thorough and honest as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit back and relax. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/88. That's not drastically high, but we will keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Deep breath… inhales deeply. I do worry about my blood pressure, you know. It has been creeping up lately, despite the medication. Perhaps I need a higher dose. Or perhaps it is just stress. My daughter worries so much, and that stresses me out. But yes, listen away. continues breathing as instructed.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Please relax your leg. Okay, good. And now the other leg. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, let’s do a quick memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Three words, you say? Very well. Let us begin. I pride myself on my memory, you know. Though it has been… unreliable lately. But I will do my best. Three words… go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I have them. Apple, table, penny. Quite simple, really. Though I must admit, I had to concentrate. It is not as easy as it used to be. But yes, apple, table, penny. I believe I have them memorized.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s move on to something else. I’m going to ask you a few questions about your orientation. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today’s date… Let me see. It is… August. Yes, August the… pauses, frowning slightly. August the 2nd. Yes, the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. I believe that is correct. My daughter always tells me the date. She worries about me forgetting. But yes, August 2nd, 2025. I am fairly certain.
DOCTOR: And what city are we in?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. We are… near the city, yes. It is… a suburban area. I do not remember the name of the city itself. My daughter drives me here. I am not very good with names and places anymore. It is… frustrating. But we are in a suburban area, near the city. That much I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you tell me who the current President is?
PATIENT: The President… Oh dear. That is… a difficult one. I… I used to follow politics very closely. But lately… it is all a blur. I remember… a woman? Or a man? I am terribly sorry, Doctor. I simply cannot recall. It is… embarrassing. I used to know all of this. I really do. But now… it is all gone. I apologize. I am a complete failure at this test.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bahta. It’s okay that you don’t know. These tests are just one piece of the puzzle. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the exam, I am concerned about possible cognitive impairment. The difficulty with recalling recent information, the disorientation, and the memory lapses are concerning. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to get a better look at your brain. And finally, I want to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A brain scan… and a neurologist? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it… is it Alzheimer’s? Is that what you think? My daughter… she has been talking about it for months. She worries so much. I understand you need to rule out other causes, and I trust your judgment. Yes, please order the tests. And yes, I will see the neurologist. I just… I just want to know what is happening. And… please, be honest with me, Doctor. Even if it is bad news. I can handle it. I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bahta. It could be Alzheimer’s, but it’s too early to say definitively. Many other conditions can cause similar symptoms, and we need to rule those out first. That’s why the blood work and the brain scan are so important. The neurologist will be able to perform a more detailed cognitive assessment and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I will write the orders for the blood work and the brain scan now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and we’ll get the brain scan scheduled as soon as possible. I'll also give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected neurologist in the area. In the meantime, it's important to continue to focus on healthy habits – a balanced diet, regular exercise, and mental stimulation. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I will also have my nurse call you in a couple of days to check on you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your honesty, and your kindness. You have put my mind at ease, somewhat. Though I am still very worried, of course. Just… one question. How long will it take to get the results of the tests? I am anxious to know what is happening, and I do not want to wait too long. And… will my daughter be able to attend the appointment with the neurologist? She is very concerned about me, and I would like her to be there.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. The blood work results should be back within a week. The brain scan may take a little longer, perhaps a week to ten days, depending on the facility. I will ensure the results are expedited as much as possible. And yes, absolutely, your daughter is more than welcome – and encouraged – to attend the appointment with Dr. Reed. It’s important for her to be involved in your care, and Dr. Reed will be happy to answer any questions she may have as well. I'll make a note of that in the referral. Here are the orders for the blood work and the referral to Dr. Reed. My nurse, Sarah, will contact you to schedule the blood work and to answer any logistical questions you may have. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you again for your time, and your kindness. You have been very helpful. I feel… a little better, knowing that we are taking steps to find out what is happening. I suppose I should go now. I will wait for the nurse to call. And thank you… for being honest with me. Even if the news is bad. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before the nurse calls. We’ll do everything we can to get you the answers you need. Take care, Mr. Bahta. .
