DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… it’s this cough. Been coughin’ up… stuff. Not good stuff. Blood in it, sometimes. I smoke, you know. Long time. Don't remember exactly how long, though. Just… a long time. Want to get it checked. Fast, if we could.
DOCTOR: Right. Cough with…hemoptysis, as you say. And a long smoking history. We will get it checked, Mr. Reyno, but rushing won’t help accuracy. Now, can you tell me more about this “stuff” you’re coughing up?
PATIENT: Hemop-what? Look, I just said blood. Red stuff. And… mucus. Yeah, mucus. It’s… mostly when I first wake up. And when I really try to cough it out. Not all the time, thankfully. It… it doesn't hurt, not really. Just… worryin'. I don't know what it is, that's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Hemoptysis is the medical term for coughing up blood. I was simply confirming. So, primarily in the mornings, and with forceful coughing. Is the amount significant?
PATIENT: Significant…? How much is significant? It's not like… a lot, a lot. Like, not fillin' a cup. More like… streaks. Streaks in the mucus. Sometimes just a little bit on the… on the thing I cough into. Paper towel. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: Streaks on the tissue, primarily with morning cough. That’s…helpful. And you mentioned this has been going on for… how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Ugh… that's the hard part. A while. Maybe… a couple months? It started small, I thought it was just a bad cough. But it's… more now. Hard to say exactly, things kinda… blend together, you know? I don't keep track of stuff like that.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, progressively worsening. We'll need to clarify that further. Now, aside from the cough and the blood, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… I get tired easier, maybe? But I’m gettin’ older. Hard to tell what’s just age, and what’s… something else. No fever, nothin' like that. And… no, I don't think so. Not really. I eat okay, sleep okay… just tired.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, but attributed to age. No fever. Good. Now, Mr. Reyno, let’s go through some standard questions. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Maybe a little? My clothes fit a little looser, but I haven’t been… weighin’ myself. Not regularly, anyway. Like I said, gettin’ older. Things change. It could just be that. I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… Not… all the time. Sometimes when I walk up hills. But I live out in the country, kinda hilly around here. I always figured that was just… being out of shape. I used to do more…walkin’, but… things changed.
DOCTOR: So, exertional dyspnea, attributed to deconditioning. We’ll need to investigate further. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… Hmm… the doctor gave me somethin’ for my blood pressure, years ago. But I don't remember what it was called. And… I think I had pneumonia once, when I was a kid. That was a long time ago. Don’t really remember much about it. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed in the past. Childhood pneumonia. And any surgeries, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Nope. Never had any surgeries. Broken a few bones when I was younger, bein’ a dumb kid. But never any… cuttin’. Nope.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Good. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Not that I know of. My mom died when I was young. Dad… he worked hard, didn't really talk about… health stuff. And… I don't know much about my grandparents, really. Didn’t keep in touch. Sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you drink alcohol, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A beer with dinner, now and then. Not much. Not a big drinker. Never really been much of a drinker, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol use. And do you smoke anything else besides cigarettes?
PATIENT: Like I said, I smoke. Just cigarettes. Always have. Tried to quit a few times, never worked. Don’t do nothin’ else. Just the cigarettes.
DOCTOR: And how many cigarettes per day, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Uh… a pack. Maybe a pack and a half. Some days. Look, I know it’s bad. I just… always have. It's hard to say exactly, I don’t count ‘em, alright?
DOCTOR: Approximately one pack per day. We've established a significant smoking history, Mr. Reyno. Now, let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I can eat anything. Take any medicine. Never had a reaction. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not really. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache. But that's it. No regular medicine. Like I said, I try to stay away from that stuff if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Reyno, I’m going to need to conduct a physical examination. This will involve listening to your lungs, checking your heart, and a few other routine checks. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please sit back and relax as best you can. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. I'd also like to check your oxygen saturation. And a quick blood pressure check. Finally, I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes. Alright, Mr. Reyno, that concludes the physical examination.
PATIENT: Okay. So… what does all that mean? Is it bad? I’m startin’ to get worried now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, the examination revealed some findings that require further investigation. Your oxygen saturation is slightly low, and I detected decreased breath sounds and wheezes in your lungs. Given your significant smoking history and the presence of blood in your cough, we need to rule out several possibilities. The most concerning possibilities include bronchitis, pneumonia, and, given the hemoptysis, we must consider the possibility of lung cancer. I am ordering a chest X-ray to begin with. We’ll also need to order a sputum sample to be analyzed for infection and abnormal cells. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lung… cancer?! Oh boy. X-ray… sputum… Is it… is it serious? How long will it take? Look, I just want to know if it’s somethin’ I gotta worry about. I don't want a lot of tests, alright? I just want it fixed. Is there… is there medicine for it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand your anxiety. It’s natural to be worried, but we need to gather information before we can determine the extent of the problem. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture of your lungs and help us identify any abnormalities. The sputum sample will help us rule out infection and check for cancerous cells. The tests themselves should not take long – the X-ray can be done immediately, and you can provide the sputum sample here at the clinic. As for treatment, it depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it is bronchitis or pneumonia, antibiotics are typically effective. If it is lung cancer, treatment options vary greatly depending on the stage and type, and could include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. I will explain all of these options in detail if a diagnosis is made. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I'm going to write the orders now and have the radiology department contact you to schedule the X-ray. The nurse will provide you with instructions for collecting the sputum sample. Do you have any immediate questions about that?
PATIENT: Sputum… how do I even… collect that? Is it… gross? I don’t wanna have to do somethin’ gross. And… can I still smoke while I’m waitin’ for the results? Just… tryin’ to think about it.
DOCTOR: Collecting the sputum sample involves coughing deeply into a sterile container. Yes, it is… not pleasant. The nurse will provide detailed instructions and a demonstration to make it as easy as possible. It's vital to cough from deep within your lungs, not just from your throat. As for smoking, Mr. Reyno, absolutely not. Smoking will further irritate your lungs, interfere with the test results, and worsen any potential condition. I strongly advise you to stop smoking immediately. I understand it’s difficult, but it's essential for your health. I can offer resources to help you quit, if you're interested. Now, do you understand the instructions regarding the sputum sample and the importance of ceasing smoking?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No smokin’. Deep cough. Got it. Resources… yeah, maybe. Anything to get this over with. Just… tell me when I can expect the results, alright? And if it’s… bad, will you explain it to me? Real talk, not… doctor talk.
DOCTOR: The radiology department should have the X-ray results within 24-48 hours. I will review them as soon as they are available and contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I will, without question, explain the results to you in plain language, Mr. Reyno. I understand your concern and will ensure you are fully informed about your condition and treatment options, should a diagnosis be made. The nurse will now provide you with the instructions for the sputum sample and information on smoking cessation resources. Do you have any other questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that's it. Just… thanks. I guess. I just hope it’s nothin’ too bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the nurse know if you have any difficulties with the sample collection. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
PATIENT: .
