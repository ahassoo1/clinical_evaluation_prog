DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Brege, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been… aggravating, to say the least. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever. That is frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts with just feelin' kinda chilly, you know? Like I need a sweater even when it's warm. Then, boom, the heat comes on. Not terribly high, I don’t think – haven’t actually taken my temperature, to be honest. Just… uncomfortable. Lasts a day or two, then goes away for a bit, then comes back. It’s been goin’ on for, oh, maybe a month now? Give or take a few days. I keep thinkin' it's just a cold, but it keeps repeating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills followed by a fever that doesn’t seem super high, lasting a day or two, then resolving, only to return after a while. A month of this repeating pattern… That does sound more than just a simple cold. And when you say "comes back," can you describe how long it usually is between these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's not regular, not like clockwork. Sometimes it's, oh, maybe a week, sometimes it’s longer, like ten days. Once it was almost two weeks. It's hard to say exactly. It just… pops up when I least expect it. I'm a chiropractor, you know, always busy with patients. Don't have time to be sick!
DOCTOR: Right, a chiropractor – so you're quite active. And it sounds like the intervals between these fevers are pretty unpredictable. Okay. Besides the fever and chills, have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Well, I get a little tired. Not exhausted, just… more than usual. And sometimes my muscles ache a bit. Like I've been workin’ too hard, which, let’s face it, I usually am. No cough, no sore throat, no… nothin’ like that. Just the fever, the chills, and feelin’ kinda run down. Oh, and a little bit of a headache sometimes, but that could just be from stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, muscle aches, and occasional headaches along with the fever and chills. No respiratory symptoms – that's good. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, the usual aches and pains from work, you know? Old age creepin' in. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that healed fine. Nothing serious, nothing I need regular checkups for. My wife keeps tellin’ me to go to the doctor more, but I always put it off. I'm usually the one fixin' people, not needin' fixin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for people who are used to being the caregivers to delay their own care. No major medical history, though. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed 'em. Knock on wood. Always been pretty lucky, health-wise… until this fever thing started. It’s just… annoying. I gotta get this sorted out, doc. I got patients relyin' on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries either. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he just… got old. A little bit of arthritis, but nothing major. My wife's side of the family, they're all pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nobody with anythin’ really serious, not that I remember. We don’t really talk about medical stuff much. It’s kinda… private.
DOCTOR: Okay, some high blood pressure on your mother's side. And you said it's not something often discussed in the family. Alright. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work a lot, as I've said. Long hours, always on my feet. I try to eat okay, but it's hard when you're busy. Mostly home-cooked meals, my wife is a good cook. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a little bit, but I cut back years ago. Mostly just water now. I don’t really have time for much else, honestly. Work, home, sleep… that’s my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so active work life, relatively healthy diet, no smoking, and minimal alcohol. That's all good information. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, if my back's really botherin' me. But that's about it. Doc, are we gettin' anywhere with this fever? I gotta be honest, I'm startin' to feel like I'm wastin' my time here.
DOCTOR: No, you're absolutely not wasting your time. It's helpful for me to get this full picture, and we are getting somewhere. It takes time to rule things out. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your lymph nodes. Just to see if anything stands out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… hurry it up, if you could. Got patients waitin'. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 100.8 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your lymph nodes are… slightly tender to the touch in your neck, but not significantly enlarged. No other noticeable abnormalities on initial exam. I’m also going to check your spleen size. Spleen is not enlarged. Given the recurring fever, fatigue, and slightly tender lymph nodes, I'd like to order some blood work. It’ll help us rule out some possible causes like infections - viral or bacterial - and check your overall blood counts. It'll also give us a baseline to compare to if the fever persists. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… alright. If you think it's necessary. Just tell me what I gotta do. Don't need a lot of fancy explanations, doc, just tell me where to go and what to do. And how long it's gonna take, 'cause, again, got patients waitin’. I’m not insured, by the way. Just so you know. I can pay cash, but I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No surprises. We can definitely work with a cash payment option. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist will draw a few vials of blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, including paperwork. We'll be looking at a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some basic inflammatory markers. The cost will be around $150-200, depending on the specific tests. I’ll have the front desk staff give you a detailed price list before you proceed. While we’re waiting for the results, I want you to monitor your temperature twice a day and keep track of any other symptoms you experience – any new aches, rashes, changes in appetite, anything at all. Also, try to get as much rest as you can, even if it means taking a little time off from work. It’s important to let your body recover. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Rest… easier said than done, doc. But I’ll try. $150-200… okay. That's… manageable. Let me just get this over with then. Room 203, you said? Anythin’ I need to bring? A list, maybe? I'm terrible with rememberin' stuff, even if I do have a good memory for details… it just gets jumbled up sometimes. And, no, I don't have any questions right now. Just… get the blood work done. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Just your ID and insurance information, though you mentioned you’re uninsured, so just your ID will be fine. The phlebotomist will guide you through the rest. I'll be here when you get back to discuss the results. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms before then. Here’s a little slip of paper with the lab order and my name and number, just in case. Take your time, and I’ll see you shortly.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks, doc. I’ll be back when I’m back. Let's just hope this gives us some answers.
