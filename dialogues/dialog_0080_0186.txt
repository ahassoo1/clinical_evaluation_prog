DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Rosanova. Good to meet you too. Uh, it’s for a tryout. A sports team tryout. Physical, they said I needed. Gotta get checked out before they let me on the field, you know? I’m hoping everything’s okay, I feel alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical – good idea! That’s smart of them to require one. And good that you're feeling alright. Just to confirm, your name is Lamark Kingan, and your date of birth is…?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, Lamark Kingan is right. Date of birth… hold on a sec. August 14th… 1962. Yeah, that’s it. 1962. It was a long time ago!
DOCTOR: Perfect, thanks. Okay, so Lamark, born August 14th, 1962… That makes you 62 years old. And I see here your height is listed as 183 centimeters and your weight as 129 kilograms. Is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty accurate. Maybe a little bit over on the weight, if I’m being honest. But yeah, around that. Six foot, give or take. And… well, let’s just say I enjoy my food. It's been a while since I had anyone measure, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We'll get a more precise weight and height here today. Before we do that, can you tell me a bit more about this sports team?
PATIENT: It's… a Mongolian wrestling team. Sort of a local thing, but they're pretty serious about it. More of a fitness thing, honestly. Keeps me active. I used to wrestle when I was younger, way younger. This is just… a way to see if I still got it, you know? And, uh, make sure I don't break anything.
DOCTOR: That's fantastic! Mongolian wrestling – that sounds intense. And it's great you're staying active. Alright, to get started, if you're comfortable, could you change into a gown?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A gown, right. Is there… a place I can change? I’m not really a fan of these things, but if it's what we gotta do… Where is it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Right through that door is the changing room. There's a private stall in there. Take your time, and just leave your clothes on the bench. I’ll be right outside when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that door. Thanks. Hopefully, it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark, let’s start with a quick look at your vital signs. Then we'll do a basic physical exam. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds good. Vital signs, right. Whatever you need. Just get it over with quickly if you can, eh? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. We'll be as efficient as possible. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 and unlabored. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can check it again later. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Do you have any history of heart problems or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh. Not that I know of. I get a little winded sometimes, walking uphill, but that’s just… getting old, right? No real heart problems, no. Never been to a doctor about it. Lungs are fine, I think. Used to spend a lot of time outside when I was younger. But, uh, haven’t really been doing much of that lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but slightly diminished at the bases. Now, let’s take a look at your abdomen. Any pain or tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: Abdomen... no, not really. Maybe a little… full sometimes. After dinner, you know? But no pain. Nothing serious. I eat a lot, but that’s it. Can we speed this up a little? I’m starting to feel a bit silly standing here like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, understand. We're almost through the basic exam. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpable. Now, I’d like to check your joints – your knees, elbows, and wrists. Just to see if there's any swelling or pain, given your wrestling background. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Joints? Oh, yeah. Wrestling. Right. My knees aren't what they used to be, if you wanna know the truth. Old injuries, mostly. Not bad enough to stop me, but they creak a bit. I don’t think there’s swelling, but… go ahead. Check ‘em. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, will do. Knees exhibit mild crepitus bilaterally with full range of motion but slight discomfort with deep flexion. No edema or erythema noted. Elbows and wrists have full range of motion without pain or tenderness. Now, just a quick neurological exam – I'll check your reflexes and strength. This just helps me get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh, geez. Look, Doc, I’m just trying to get back in shape, not become an astronaut. Is this really necessary? I feel fine, okay? My strength is… adequate. I can still wrestle, can’t I?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lamark. You’re right, it’s about getting back in shape. This is standard for a pre-participation physical, especially given your age and activity level. It helps rule out any underlying issues that could put you at risk. It won’t take long, I promise. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Alright. That completes the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits, but your blood pressure is elevated, and you mentioned some knee discomfort. Do you have any questions for me before we discuss next steps?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure… figures. No, not really questions. Just… what does this mean? Can I still wrestle? Is it gonna be a problem? That’s all I care about, really. I don’t wanna mess up my knees, and I don’t wanna… you know. And is there anything I should do about the blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Okay, those are good questions, Lamark. Let's address them one by one. The knee discomfort is likely related to old wrestling injuries, and we can discuss strategies to manage that – things like stretching, proper warm-up, and potentially bracing. As for the blood pressure, 140/90 is considered stage 1 hypertension. It could be a temporary elevation due to anxiety or the stress of the exam, but it's something we need to take seriously. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't wrestle, but we need to investigate further to rule out any underlying causes. I’d recommend a repeat blood pressure check in a week or so, preferably at home, using a home blood pressure monitor. And I’d also like to order some basic blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out other potential issues. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, jeez. Look, I really don’t like doctors, and I really don’t like needles. But… if it means I can keep wrestling, I guess. A week, huh? I can check it at home. I got a machine somewhere. But what about the knees? Can I at least start stretching or something? I don’t wanna just sit around waiting. And is this gonna be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Lamark. We'll keep things as minimal as possible. The blood work is just a precaution. As for your knees, yes, absolutely! Start with gentle stretching – hamstring stretches, quad stretches, calf stretches. Warm up thoroughly before any activity, and listen to your body. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. I can show you some basic exercises before you leave. And you're right to ask about the cost. I’ll see if we can get the blood work done at a discounted rate since you don't have insurance. I'll also have the front desk look into any programs that might help cover the costs. Let me write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor, just in case you don't have one, and a list of exercises for your knees. We’ll start with these steps, monitor your blood pressure and knee discomfort, and then decide if further investigation is needed. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. That… that sounds okay. Stretching, blood pressure check, and… hopefully, not too much expense. A list of exercises would be great, and… yeah. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you not just telling me I’m too old to wrestle. I guess I’ll go change and get outta here, then. Where do I go to pay?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lamark. It’s good to hear you’re staying active, and I want to help you continue doing what you enjoy, safely. The front desk is just down the hall to your left. They'll take care of the payment and schedule a follow-up appointment to review your blood work results and discuss your progress. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Alright, take care, and good luck with your training!
PATIENT: .
