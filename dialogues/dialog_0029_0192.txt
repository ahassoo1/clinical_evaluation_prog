DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, Dr. Chora. It's... the army thing. Need this exam done. They want it before... well, before anything happens with the recruitment. Seems silly, really, checking if I'm fit before I even sign anything. But rules are rules, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. A pre-enlistment physical. Yes, standard procedure. It is good they’re being thorough. To get started, can you tell me a little more about why you're joining the army now?
PATIENT: Why? Honestly? What a question. Look, things aren’t… booming, you know? Factory work’s been slow. Wife keeps saying we need more stability. This… this offers that, doesn’t it? Regular pay, benefits… I’m a practical man, Dr. Chora. Not one for dreams. Just… sensible choices. Is that what you need to know? It’s not like I’ve been planning this since I was a boy scout.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Hartness. No, it’s helpful to understand the context. Just trying to get a full picture. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Plenty. Working with engines, you get a few scrapes and bruises. Broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder when I was younger. Healed fine, though. No big problems. Illnesses… hmm. Usual colds, flu. Had the measles as a kid, of course. Nothing… serious. Never been in hospital for anything long-term. Why would I be? I keep myself going. What kind of serious are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No major hospitalizations. Just the broken wrist and typical childhood illnesses. And you said the wrist healed completely?
PATIENT: Completely. Years ago. No trouble with it at all. I can still tighten a bolt faster than most fellas half my age. Don’t need any fancy scans or anything, do I? It’s a wrist, not a… a heart or something. Seems like a waste of time, checking something that’s perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about unnecessary testing, Mr. Hartness. However, as part of the pre-enlistment physical, we need to document everything thoroughly. It’s for their records, and to ensure your safety should you be deployed. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Asthma? Goodness, no. I eat sensible, I work hard, I don’t sit around all day. I'm not one of those people. Heart problems? My father lived to be eighty, healthy as a horse. Look, I'm a strong man. I don't get sick. Are you trying to find something wrong with me? This is starting to feel… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Hartness, I’m not trying to find something wrong with you. I’m just following protocol. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. Vitamins… sometimes a multivitamin, if my wife reminds me. She worries I don’t get enough fruit. But it’s not regular. Supplements… no. I get my strength from hard work, not pills. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Are you going to ask me about my childhood pets next?
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications or supplements. We're almost done with the history portion. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a bit of a sniffle with pollen sometimes, but everyone does, don't they? Nothing serious. No rashes, no breathing problems, nothing like that. I'm a pretty tough Swede, Doctor. Don’t break out in hives over a bit of dust. Is that what you were expecting?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies. Good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family - things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental illness?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Father had a bit of trouble with his knees when he got older, arthritis, I think. Mother was always healthy, lived a long life. Grandparents… well, they were gone before I was old enough to remember much. No cancer that I know of. No… mental illness. We’re a practical family, Doctor. Not one for… fuss. Is that good enough? I’m not sure what they’d want to know about great-aunt Hilda and her prize-winning dahlias.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis in your father. No other significant medical history that you're aware of. Now, to finish up the history, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What's that supposed to mean? Do you want to know if I like football? Look, I work hard, I come home to my wife, I don't go causing trouble. I don't drink much, maybe a beer with dinner on a Saturday. I don't smoke. I don't do… whatever it is people do these days. Is this important? It feels like you're fishing for something.
DOCTOR: It’s important for a complete picture, Mr. Hartness. It helps us understand your overall health. Let me be specific. Do you currently use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Never have. Disgusting habit. My father always said a man should be able to work hard without needing a crutch. What do you take me for? A weakling? I'm a Swede, Doctor. We build things. We don't… puff on things. Next question.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tobacco use. And you mentioned you drink alcohol occasionally. About how many alcoholic beverages do you consume in a typical week?
PATIENT: A few. Maybe three or four beers. On a Saturday. Sometimes less. It’s not like I’m sitting here slurring my words every day. It’s just… a bit of relaxation after a long week. My wife makes a nice stew, I have a beer. That’s it. Don’t make it sound like I’ve got a problem, Doctor. It’s sensible. A man deserves a little something after working his fingers to the bone.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four beers on the weekend. Okay. And finally, are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Yes! Of course, I am. I told you, factory work. Though it's been slow lately, which is why... well, never mind. Engine assembly. Been doing it for twenty years. Good, honest work. But, like I said, things haven't been booming. Is that what you needed to know? That I'm not sitting around doing nothing all day? I'm a hard worker, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. This will include checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just… don't poke and prod too much. I've got things to do, you know. And don't tell me I'm out of shape. I can still lift more than most of the young lads around the factory. Let's just get this done. Blood pressure, pulse… whatever. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please have a seat on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. I'm getting a reading of 140 over 90. That's a little elevated, Mr. Hartness. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly strong. Lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Do you have any pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No. A bit… surprising, maybe. Never had anyone hit my knee with a hammer before. What does it mean, all this hitting and listening? Is something wrong? You said 'elevated'. Is my blood pressure too high? Look, I'm a practical man, Doctor. Just tell me straight. Is this going to stop me from joining the army? That’s all I care about. Don't give me fancy medical talk. Yes or no?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Hartness. It’s not necessarily a reason to be immediately concerned, but it is something we need to monitor. It could be due to stress or a number of other factors. We'll need to repeat the reading a few times to get an accurate baseline. And no, it doesn't automatically disqualify you, but it may require further evaluation. Okay, second reading is 142 over 92. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Ears are clear, throat is normal. Pulses are strong and regular in all extremities. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Fine, walking. It's not like I've spent the last twenty years sitting still. There. Perfectly normal. You're making a big deal out of nothing, aren't you? Just tell me if I can join the army or not. This is wasting my time, and probably yours. I've got a factory to get back to, even if it is slow. Don't tell me I'm walking funny or something. I'm a practical man, Doctor, not a ballerina.
DOCTOR: Your gait is normal, Mr. Hartness. However, I do notice some slight stiffness in your shoulders. Do you experience any pain or limited range of motion in your shoulders?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Well… maybe a bit. After a long day at the factory, working with engines. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… achy. It goes away after I’ve had a bit of a stretch. It's nothing, really. Everyone gets a bit stiff after a long day of work, doesn't it? I've been doing this for twenty years, you know. It’s just… wear and tear. It’s not going to stop me from lifting things. See? Perfectly fine. Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you've never had any specific injuries to your shoulders?
PATIENT: No, never. Just… the usual bumps and scrapes. Nothing that required a doctor’s visit. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I can handle a bit of discomfort. I don’t go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. Besides, it's my shoulders, not my heart or lungs. What are you looking for, exactly? Are you trying to find something wrong with me? This is getting ridiculous. I need a straight answer. Can I join the army or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. Based on my initial examination, there are a few things that need further investigation before I can give you a definitive answer regarding your eligibility for enlistment. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have some stiffness in your shoulders. I recommend a few tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an X-ray of your shoulders. These tests will help me determine if there are any underlying issues that could affect your ability to serve. I also recommend consulting with a physical therapist to assess your shoulder stiffness and range of motion. Would you be willing to pursue these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Physical therapist? This is… this is getting out of hand. I just wanted a quick check-up. Now you’re telling me I need blood work, X-rays, and… a therapist? Look, Doctor, I'm a practical man. I don’t have time for all this. I need to know if I can join the army, not spend weeks getting poked and prodded. Is it a yes or a no? If you can't give me a straight answer, I'll just go to another doctor. I've got better things to do than run around getting tests. Honestly. What’s the point? This is a waste of time. A complete waste of time. Tell me now. Can I join the army or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, and I truly wish I could give you a definitive “yes” or “no” right now. However, ethically, and for your own safety, I cannot recommend you proceed with enlistment without further investigation. The elevated blood pressure could indicate an underlying cardiovascular issue, and the shoulder stiffness could limit your range of motion and predispose you to injury. Enlistment involves significant physical demands, and it's crucial to ensure you are physically fit to handle them. I’m not trying to prevent you from joining the army; I’m trying to protect your health. I can provide you with referrals to local labs and a physical therapist. Alternatively, you are, of course, free to seek a second opinion. However, please understand that any doctor will likely recommend similar investigations before clearing you for enlistment. I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on your enlistment application without these tests.
PATIENT: .
