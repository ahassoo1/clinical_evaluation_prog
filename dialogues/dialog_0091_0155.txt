DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. Been happening for a while now, I suppose. Not sure how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Makes it hard to… well, to do things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. It sounds concerning, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. You mentioned the shaking has been happening for a while, and you’re finding it difficult to do things. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate… right. Hmm. It’s… small things, mostly. Holding a cup of coffee… writing… even buttoning my shirt. Used to be no problem. Now… well, now things spill, and the buttons… they just… won't cooperate. It's frustrating, honestly. Not a big deal, I guess, but it's getting worse. I don't remember when it started, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik, and it is important that we investigate this, even if it started gradually. You're right to bring it to our attention. The fact that it’s affecting everyday tasks like holding a cup or buttoning a shirt is significant. You mentioned you don't recall exactly when it began. Approximately how long ago would you say you first noticed these difficulties?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. Months, I suppose? Maybe… six months? Longer? Everything just… blends together, you know? I used to be very good with dates, working with the plant and all, keeping records… but that was years ago. I really can't put a precise time on it. I'm sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Jezik. Knowing it’s been at least six months gives us a timeframe to work with. And please, don't apologize for not remembering exact dates; memory can be unreliable, especially as we get older. To better understand what might be causing this shaking, could you describe the shaking itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a violent tremble, if that makes sense. It’s more… subtle. Like a little vibration, mostly in my hands and arms. Sometimes it feels like it’s coming from inside, you know? It’s worse when I’m trying to do something, like reaching for something or holding still. And it seems… worse when I’m stressed, maybe? Though, what isn't worse when I'm stressed these days?
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Mr. Jezik. A subtle vibration that’s worse with activity and potentially stress. It’s good you’ve noticed those patterns. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I… well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, more than usual. But I’m 79 years old, Doctor! Tiredness comes with the territory, doesn’t it? I… No, I can’t really think of anything else. My hands get cold easily, maybe? But again, that’s probably just the age. I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: You're right to consider your age, Mr. Jezik, and it's good you're mindful of what might be normal changes versus something new. The tiredness and cold hands are worth noting, however. Now, regarding your medical history: do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s a long list, I suspect. Let’s see… I had a bit of trouble with my heart years ago, they fixed it with a… a thing. A pacemaker, I think it was. And my blood pressure was always a bit high. Oh, and I broke my wrist a few years back, but that healed fine. I'm probably forgetting something… Honestly, I saw a lot of doctors over the years. It’s all a bit of a blur now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. A history of heart trouble with a pacemaker, high blood pressure, and a healed wrist fracture. That’s a good start. Do you happen to know what year you had the pacemaker implanted?
PATIENT: Pacemaker… goodness. That was… a long time ago. Let me think… I was still working at the plant, definitely. It must have been… the 90s? Early 90s, maybe? I really can’t be sure. They sent me to a specialist in the city, I remember that. It was a big deal at the time. But honestly, Doctor, the details are… gone. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. Jezik. The early 90s is helpful. And it's perfectly understandable that details fade over time. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And… and I think that's it. Oh! Sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it's really acting up. But I don’t take that every day. Mostly just when my hands are stiff. I’m really not much of a medicine person, if you know what I mean. I prefer to just… deal with things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. A medication for blood pressure, and something as needed for arthritis. Do you recall the names of these medications, even approximately?
PATIENT: Names… oh dear. That’s a tough one. The blood pressure pill… it’s small and white. I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I really can't be sure. I just ask the pharmacist to give me the same ones every time. And the arthritis medication… I have no idea. It’s a little orange pill, I think. I really don't pay much attention to the names, Doctor. I just take what I’m told.
DOCTOR: Thank you for trying, Mr. Jezik. It’s alright if you don’t recall the specific names. We can often clarify this with your pharmacy records. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes with pollen, but that’s just seasonal. Nothing serious. I don't have any… big allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Jezik. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart later in life. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. And my brother… he had something with his nerves, I think. But honestly, I wasn’t very close to my family, so I don’t really know much about their medical history. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t really talk about those things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. A family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and a nerve condition. That gives us some useful information. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now, so I don’t do much physical work. I used to be very active, working at the plant, always on my feet. Now I mostly just… relax. I enjoy reading, when my eyes cooperate. I try to eat healthy, but I have a bit of a sweet tooth, I confess. And I used to drink a little bit of beer, but I’ve cut back on that lately. It’s a pretty quiet life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. That gives me a good overall picture. Let me review your records here for a moment to see what additional information we have. …Alright. It appears your primary care physician is Dr. Novotny, and your last visit was approximately one year ago. The notes indicate stable blood pressure on Lisinopril, and occasional use of Naproxen for arthritis. No documented allergies. There's a note about the pacemaker implantation in 1993. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. This will help me to better assess your condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… fine. A physical examination. Yes, go ahead. I suppose it’s better to check things out properly. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you could. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Your heart sounds are regular, with a normal pacemaker rhythm. Your lungs are clear. I’m now assessing your upper extremity strength and coordination. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose with each hand, alternating quickly?
PATIENT: This is… harder than it used to be. See? The shaking… it’s worse when I try to do something precise. It’s… frustrating. I used to be so steady.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is a noticeable tremor in your hands, which is more pronounced with movement. I'm noting that it appears to be a resting tremor, but it also increases with intentional movement, what we call intention tremor. Now, if you would be comfortable, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Careful now… I don’t want to fall. My legs… they don’t always cooperate. It’s like… they have a mind of their own. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I observe a slightly shuffling gait and some mild instability. Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the physical examination, the most likely cause of your symptoms is essential tremor. However, given your age and the presence of other symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities. It could also be related to medication side effects, though less likely given your current regimen. We'll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I would like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a creatinine level. I also recommend a neurological consultation to further evaluate your tremor and rule out any underlying neurological conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Alright, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t like feeling like this, all shaky and unsteady. Yes, go ahead with the tests. And… thank you. For… for taking the time to listen, and to try and figure things out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concern, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I’m ordering the blood work now. The lab should be able to draw the samples today. I will also prepare a referral to Dr. Kovac, a neurologist I trust. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding caffeine and excessive stress, as these can worsen tremors. Please continue to take your medications as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s not something too serious. That’s all. And thank you again. For everything. I think… I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. We will take things one step at a time. We’re going to get the test results back and then formulate a treatment plan, if needed. Alright. I will have the lab results sent to me as soon as they are available, and I will contact you to discuss them. Here is a copy of the lab requisition and the referral to Dr. Kovac. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Thank you for coming in today. Take care of yourself, Mr. Jezik.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
