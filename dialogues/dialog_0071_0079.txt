DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Courtnye. I'm Dr. Galena. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don't really have a lot of time, so I'll get straight to it. My aunty, she’s been bruising really easily lately. She’s on that blood thinner stuff, you know, Warfarin? And it's just...more than usual. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily… and she’s on Warfarin, you said?
PATIENT: Yep, Warfarin. She's been on it for...oh, about three years now, since her stroke. It’s just gotten worse in the last couple of weeks. Like, she bumps into something small and gets a huge bruise. It doesn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Right. Three years on Warfarin after a stroke… and the bruising has increased in the last two weeks. Has she had any falls, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no falls. She’s pretty careful, actually. That's why I’m so concerned! It’s not like she’s been tripping over things. It just...happens. Like, she was carrying a grocery bag the other day and noticed a bruise on her arm after. It’s just…random.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, random bruising despite being careful… Has she noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… She says she’s been a bit more tired than usual, but she's always been a bit of a napper, honestly. And…oh! She mentioned her gums bled a little when she brushed her teeth yesterday. Just a tiny bit, but she said it felt different than usual. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s definitely important. Fatigue and bleeding gums… Alright. Let’s get a little more information. Has she changed anything in her diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. She pretty much eats the same things, you know, taro, fish, that sort of thing. She loves her lu’au, that hasn’t changed. Oh! Actually, she did start drinking more pineapple juice last week. She read it was good for her… but that's it. Does pineapple juice mess with the blood thinner? I wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Pineapple juice… that could be a factor, yes. It contains bromelain, which can interact with Warfarin. Okay. And has she started or stopped any other medications, even over-the-counter things, in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Let me think... she does take something for her arthritis, that little orange pill… Naproxen, I think it's called. And she uses a cream for it too, but that's been the same for ages. Oh! And she bought some paracetamol for a headache last week, just a couple of tablets. That’s all I can think of, honestly. She doesn’t really like taking pills if she can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Naproxen regularly, and paracetamol for a headache… Okay. And just to be thorough, has she had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Infections…no, not that I know of. She had a little cold about a month ago, but that cleared up quick. She’s pretty healthy for her age, all things considered. She just worries a lot, you know? That's probably why I brought her in, honestly. This bruising just isn’t normal, and I don’t want anything bad to happen.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you brought her in. Alright, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. And then we'll likely need to check her INR levels, to see how her Warfarin is working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. The quicker we figure this out, the better. I have to get back to work soon, though, so if we can keep things moving, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible. Let’s start with a look at the bruising. Could you point out where she's noticed it the most?
PATIENT: She's got some on her arms, mostly. And on her legs, a couple of bigger ones there. Oh, and she showed me her back this morning, a little patch there that she said she doesn't even remember bumping. It’s just…all over. It's worrying me, seeing her like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me take a look… These do appear more extensive than one might expect with typical Warfarin use. And they are varying in color, which suggests different ages. I’m also noting some petechiae – those tiny red spots – around her ankles. That's something we'll want to investigate further. I'll listen to her heart and lungs quickly, and then we’ll head over to the lab for that INR check. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds good. The heart and lungs thing is okay, I guess. Just…let me know if you see anything bad, alright? I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily, you know? She gets anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No immediate concerns there. Alright, let's go get that blood draw done. It's a quick procedure, and will give us a much clearer picture of how her Warfarin is affecting her clotting. Then we can discuss the results and figure out the best course of action. .
