DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… frustrating, to be honest. My wife, she keeps saying I’m… not myself. Little things, you know? I forget where I put my tools, or I ask the same question twice. It’s not like I’m stupid, I just… misplace things. She worries too much, if you ask me, but she insisted I come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good that your wife is looking out for you, and it's smart to get these things checked out. Forgetfulness can be a lot of things, and it’s best to rule things out. So, when did you start noticing these… “little things” happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly. Maybe six months? It comes and goes, you know? Some days I’m perfectly sharp, other days… like yesterday, I couldn't remember the name of the new apprentice, right there in front of me! Embarrassing. I’ve been setting tile for forty years, Doctor. Forty years! You’d think I’d remember a young man’s name. It’s just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Right, irritating is a good way to put it. And it’s certainly not a reflection of your experience. Six months is a reasonable timeframe to start looking into it. Has this been interfering with your work at all, besides the embarrassment?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. A couple of times I’ve had to redo sections because I miscalculated the cuts. Nothing major, thankfully. My son, he helps me with the math now, but… I used to do all that myself, you know? Perfectly. And the other day, I almost used the wrong adhesive on a marble floor. My wife caught me just in time. She’s got a good eye, thank goodness. It's… unsettling, Doctor. I take pride in my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so miscalculations and almost using the wrong adhesive… that is more than just simple forgetfulness. It sounds like it’s impacting your ability to perform your work accurately. And it's good your wife is there to help. Let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any other changes besides the memory issues and the miscalculations?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. I… I get a bit more tired, maybe? I used to work all day, no problem. Now, I need to sit down after a few hours. My wife says I’m more… irritable too. I snap at her sometimes, which I shouldn’t. But she asks so many questions! She worries about everything. It’s not like I’m ill, you know? Just… getting older, probably. Though I’ve always been a strong man. Still am. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and irritability… those are good things to note. It sounds like there's more going on than just simple aging. And it’s good you're recognizing these changes. Now, I want to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, nothing major. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for that, every morning. And my knees, they bother me sometimes. Arthritis, he said. I get injections when they flare up. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, for my age. I eat okay, mostly Khmer food. My wife makes sure I get enough rice. She's always fussing over my diet. It’s… a lot of fuss, if you ask me. But I take my medicine. I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees treated with injections. That’s helpful to know. And it’s good you’re taking your medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem. My wife always asks me that question when I go to the doctor. She worries I’ll have a reaction to something. But I’ve always been fine. Fish, maybe? I don’t eat much fish. Not an allergy, exactly, just… doesn't sit well. But I don't think that's relevant. I eat everything else. Mostly. Rice, definitely. I need my rice.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you've mentioned you eat a lot of rice, which is good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix taken out, when I was a young man. And… oh, I had a small operation on my knee, a few years back. Just a clean-up, the doctor said. Something about cartilage. Nothing major, really. I was back to work in a week. I can’t sit around for long, you know? I need to be doing something. Tile doesn’t set itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a knee arthroscopy. That’s helpful. And I understand you like to stay active. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother… she was a bit confused towards the end, but we just thought it was old age. She lived a long life. My aunt, on my father’s side, she had some problems, too. My wife says it might have been… what did she say? Dementia? But nobody really talked about it much back then. We didn't have doctors like you. Mostly, everyone just got old and… faded away. It was sad, but… that’s just how it was. We didn’t have fancy names for things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of confusion in your mother and aunt, possibly dementia. That's important information. And you’re right, things were different back then. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father, he smoked, but I always hated the smell. Alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. My wife didn’t like it. Said it was making me… grumpy. So I stopped. She's good at getting her way, my wife. I mostly drink water now. And tea. Lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and you used to drink alcohol but have stopped. Mostly tea and water now. That's good. Alright, Mr. Lason, I think I have a pretty good picture of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just don’t take too long. I have work to get back to. Tile doesn’t set itself, you know. But go ahead. Just… be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Reflexes and strength are normal. Now, I'm going to do a brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking. This won't take long. Okay, Mr. Lason, that's all for the physical exam. The cognitive assessment shows some mild difficulty with recent memory and calculation, which aligns with what you and your wife have been describing. Your overall physical exam is unremarkable, but the cognitive findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? What’s wrong with me? Am I… losing my mind? My wife will be beside herself. I told her I was fine! Mostly fine. This is all… unsettling. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Don’t beat around the bush. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it’s understandable you’re feeling unsettled. Let me assure you, losing your mind is not necessarily what’s happening. The cognitive assessment doesn't point to anything definitive, but it does suggest some mild cognitive impairment. This could be due to several things, and it's important we figure out the cause. Several things can cause this, including normal age-related changes, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, sleep disturbances, and more serious conditions like mild cognitive impairment or early stages of dementia. Your symptoms, combined with the cognitive assessment, warrant further investigation to rule out potential causes and determine the best course of action. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and other potential issues. I'd also like to order a brain scan, specifically an MRI, to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out any underlying problems. I want to be clear: this doesn't automatically mean you have dementia. Many things can cause cognitive issues, and we need to investigate thoroughly before making any diagnosis. We’ll take it one step at a time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Brain scan? Doctor, are you saying… you think it’s serious? I feel perfectly fine, mostly. A bit tired, maybe, and I forget things sometimes, but everyone does that! This all seems a bit… excessive. My wife will be frantic. She worries about everything. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I’m on Medicare, but… And what about work? I have jobs lined up! I can’t just stop setting tile. People are counting on me. This is… very upsetting. Just tell me straight, Doctor. What are the chances it’s nothing? Really nothing?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your anxiety and frustration. Let me address your concerns directly. Ordering the brain scan and blood tests is a precautionary measure. It’s standard practice when evaluating cognitive concerns. It doesn’t automatically mean anything is seriously wrong, but it allows us to rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The chances it's "nothing" are certainly possible. Many factors can mimic cognitive impairment, such as stress, sleep deprivation, or medication side effects. The tests will help us identify if those are contributing factors. Regarding Medicare, yes, both the blood tests and the brain scan should be covered, though there may be co-pays or deductibles depending on your plan. I can have the billing department confirm the estimated costs for you. And I understand your concern about work. We’ll do everything we can to get a diagnosis quickly so you can make informed decisions. For now, I wouldn't recommend making any major changes to your work schedule. We need to gather more information first. I want to emphasize that we’re approaching this cautiously and systematically. The goal is to find the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to address them. I’m not going to speculate on the likelihood of a serious condition without having the test results. Are you comfortable with proceeding with the blood tests and the brain scan?
PATIENT: Fine. Do whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Just… get it over with. The sooner we know, the sooner I can go back to work and my wife can stop worrying. But I expect you to explain everything to me in plain English. None of that medical jargon. And tell the billing department to call my wife. She handles all that. And… what if it is something serious? What happens then? I don’t want to end up in one of those… places. I’ve seen what they’re like. I want to stay in my own home, as long as possible. Just… tell me the truth, Doctor. Don't sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your fears and I will absolutely explain everything in plain English, no jargon. I will also ensure the billing department contacts your wife directly. Regarding what happens if it is something serious… that's a difficult question, but I want to be honest with you. If we were to find evidence of a condition like mild cognitive impairment or early dementia, there are several treatment options available. These can include medications to help manage symptoms, lifestyle changes, cognitive therapy, and support groups. The goal is to maintain your quality of life and independence for as long as possible. Staying in your own home is often possible with appropriate support. We would discuss all available options with you and your wife and develop a personalized care plan that meets your needs and preferences. There are many resources available to help you stay at home, including home health aides, adult day care programs, and respite care. I want to assure you that we would work with you every step of the way. I will be honest and transparent about your condition and treatment options, and I will help you make informed decisions about your care. We are not going to rush into anything. I will order the blood tests and schedule the brain scan for you today. I’ll also give you a referral for a cognitive specialist for a more in-depth evaluation. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And please, Doctor, make sure that scan isn’t too uncomfortable. I’ve got work to do. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. The scan is generally well-tolerated, and the technicians will do their best to make you comfortable. It will take about 30-60 minutes. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the scan. I'll see you next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Mr. Lason. .
