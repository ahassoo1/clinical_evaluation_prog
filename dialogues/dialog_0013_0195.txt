DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's...fine. My husband, he thinks I need a little...boost. You know, one of those cards? A "Get Well" card, or something encouraging. He says I've been a bit down. Honestly, I don't see what the fuss is about, but he insisted. It’s August 2nd, isn't it? He’s very particular about dates.
DOCTOR: Right, August 2nd. Your husband sounds very caring. It’s good he’s looking out for you. While I appreciate his concern and it’s wonderful he brought you in, I’m a doctor, so I’d still like to understand why he – and maybe you, a little bit – feel you’re not quite yourself. Sometimes a little check-up can rule things out, even if it's just to give reassurance. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Well, I feel perfectly normal! Honestly, I don’t understand why I’m even here. My husband… he worries too much. Always has. He thinks because I don’t spend all day fussing over things like… like flowers or baking, that I’m unhappy. He says I should take up a hobby. What nonsense. I work, I keep the house tidy, I cook… it’s enough. I don’t need a hobby. Are you going to give me the card or not? It’s a simple request, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janeth. It sounds like you’re very capable and busy, and that your husband has different expectations. And I can certainly write a note, absolutely. But before I do, and just to be thorough, I’d like to ask a few questions. Not to question your feelings, but to rule out anything else that might be going on. Sometimes, even when we feel "normal," our bodies can be telling us something different. Could you tell me about your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Fine! Perfectly adequate. I get up, I go to work, I do everything I need to do. I don't lie around all day, if that's what you're asking. My husband says I don’t relax enough. He thinks I should sit and drink tea. Tea! I have things to do. Honestly, sometimes I wish he’d just let me get on with it. Is this going to take much longer? I have laundry to fold. And the garden needs weeding. I don't understand why I have to explain all this.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Janeth. It sounds like you’re very independent and keep a very full schedule. It’s good to be busy, but sometimes when we push ourselves too much, it can affect how we feel, even if we don’t realize it. Has your appetite been normal?
PATIENT: Normal, yes. I eat perfectly well. I cook good food, and I eat it. My husband complains I don’t make enough fancy dishes. He wants soufflés and things. Honestly, who has time for soufflés? A good, solid meal is what people need. Rice, lentils, vegetables... perfectly healthy. He says I should try new recipes. It’s all very… unnecessary, really. Are you writing all this down? It’s rather private, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I am, Janeth. Everything you tell me is confidential, and it helps me understand the bigger picture. It sounds like you’re a very practical person, and you take care of yourself with good, healthy food. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sleep lately?
PATIENT: Sleep? Yes, I sleep perfectly well. I go to bed at a reasonable hour, I get up when I need to. My husband says I don’t rest enough when I’m sleeping. He says I toss and turn. Honestly, I don’t know what he’s talking about. I sleep soundly. He's always listening for things. He’s very… observant. It’s exhausting, frankly. Is this getting us any closer to the card? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janeth. It sounds like you feel your husband is perhaps focusing on things that aren't necessarily accurate, and that it's causing you stress. It’s good that you’re getting enough sleep, but sometimes stress can still affect us even when we think we’re resting. And sometimes, certain medical conditions can present with symptoms that are easy to dismiss. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I’ve maintained a perfectly healthy weight for years. My husband… well, he sometimes comments on my portions. He thinks I should eat more. He says I’m too thin. Honestly, I eat perfectly well! He’s always trying to get me to eat more sweets, more cake, more… nonsense. It's really quite irritating, frankly. He means well, I suppose, but he's always fussing. Can we please just get this card? I’m starting to feel quite flustered. It’s a simple request!
DOCTOR: Janeth, I appreciate you being so honest with me. It sounds like you're feeling very pressured by your husband's expectations, and that it's causing you a lot of stress and frustration. It’s also very common for stress and worry to manifest physically, even if we don't immediately recognize it. I'm starting to get a clearer picture, and while I can certainly write a note for your husband, I'm a little concerned about some of what you've described – specifically the comments about your weight and portions, and your overall level of stress. Before I write anything, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just to rule out any underlying medical issues that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? No! Absolutely not. What for? I’m perfectly healthy. My husband just worries too much. He's always sending me to doctors for things. It’s a waste of time and money. I told you, I just want a card. A simple "Get Well" or "Encouragement" card. That's all. I don’t need poking and prodding. Honestly, I’m starting to think I shouldn’t have come here at all. It’s all very… unnecessary. Just write the card and let me go home. I have things to do. Is that too much to ask? Honestly!
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your frustration and I apologize if I’m causing you any discomfort. I completely respect your wishes. You are absolutely right; you are the one in control of your healthcare, and you have the right to refuse any examination or treatment. It sounds like your husband's concern is causing you a lot of stress, and that’s something we should address. While I can certainly write a note for him, I’m a little concerned that there might be something more going on, like anxiety or even a nutritional deficiency contributing to how you’re feeling. Before I write the note, would you be open to discussing some resources for managing stress, or perhaps a referral to a therapist who could help you navigate your relationship with your husband?
PATIENT: Therapist? Absolutely not! My husband will never hear of it. He'd be furious. And I certainly don’t need a therapist. I'm perfectly capable of managing my own life, thank you very much. Honestly, this is ridiculous! I came here for a card, not a lecture about my marriage and my mental health! Just write the blasted card and let me leave. A simple "Get Well" or "Encouragement" note. It's not rocket science! Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here already. I have laundry, weeding, and a husband who’s probably worrying himself sick. I really must go. Just write the card. Please. Is that too much to ask? I’m starting to feel quite faint. This has been most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. I understand. I will write the note. "To Janeth, Wishing you all the best and sending you encouragement to continue doing everything you do so well. Remember to prioritize your own well-being. With kind regards, Dr. Morenomartinez." Here you go. I truly hope you take care of yourself, Janeth. And if you ever feel like you want to talk, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I won't push any further examinations or referrals today. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Honestly, what a waste of time. .
