DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My wife… she wants a baby. We… we are older, you see. I think we need to… plan? I don’t know the words. We just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta, that’s perfectly reasonable. It's wonderful you and your wife are considering this, and planning is a very smart approach, especially as you mentioned being older. So, you’re hoping to start a family, and you'd like me to assess if there are any health concerns that might affect that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is right. I… I make little things. Metal and plastic. Model things. But… my body? I don't know if it is good for… for a baby. I am… seventy years now. Is that too old? My wife, she is… a little younger. But still… old.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Carlotta. It’s true that age can play a role in conception and pregnancy, both for men and women. We'll want to look at a few things to get a clearer picture. For you, we can discuss your overall health, any existing medical conditions, and perhaps do some basic tests to assess sperm quality. And of course, we’ll need to gather information about your wife’s health as well. First, let’s start with you. Do you have any current medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… doctor… I forget so easily now. I have… aches. Old man aches. And sometimes my… water is not good. Not strong. I go to the… bathroom often. But… diagnosed? I don’t think so. I take a little pill for my… water, the doctor gave it to me last year. But other than that… I feel okay. Mostly okay. I eat… food. And sleep. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, "old man aches" are very common, and we can certainly talk about those. And the issue with your urine – going frequently and not feeling strong – that’s helpful information. It sounds like you might have some prostate concerns, which are also common as men get older. It's good you're taking a pill for that. Do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: The… the name… it is a little white pill. Small. I take it every night. My wife, she gets it for me. She goes to the… the drugstore. I don’t remember the writing on the bottle. It is… complicated writing. I just take the pill. It helps me sleep better too, I think. I am sorry I cannot remember the name. My mind… it is not so good anymore.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's very common to forget medication names, especially when you have several things going on. We can look it up based on your pharmacy information, no problem. Let’s shift gears for a moment. Aside from the issues with your urine, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, or any problems with your lungs or kidneys?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Doctor told me… years ago, my heart was strong. He listened with the… the tube. Everything was good. I walk… I used to walk more. Now… not so much. My legs… they get tired. But no doctor said anything bad about my heart. And I don’t have… what was it? Sugar sickness? No. I eat sweets sometimes. My wife worries about that. She is a good wife. Very worried.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your heart and no history of diabetes. It sounds like you’ve been generally healthy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. Let me see. When I was a young man, very young, I broke my arm. Playing football. They… fixed it. Put it in a… a cast. That was a long time ago. And… I think I was in the hospital once when I was very sick. A fever. Very high fever. But that was… many, many years ago. I don't remember much about it. Just the arm, I think. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a young man, and a hospitalization for a fever a long time ago. And just to be thorough, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he was a strong man. Worked very hard. He lived a long life. But… he had problems with his legs. Swelling. Like mine. I think. And my mother… she was very thin. She… she got sick when she was old. Something with her… breathing. She was in the hospital. But I don’t know what it was. Cancer… I don’t think so. No one talked about cancer. Old family. Many have passed now. I forget so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father with leg swelling and your mother with breathing problems. That's helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I eat many things. My wife cooks good food. Sometimes my skin gets itchy… when I am in the sun too long. But that is just the sun. And… sometimes I sneeze. But everyone sneezes! I don’t think I am allergic to anything. No. I don’t think so. I am a strong man! I can eat anything. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications – besides the pill for your urine – vitamins, supplements, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My wife… she gives me a little pill sometimes for my… aches. When they are very bad. A white one. And… sometimes I take something for my… stomach. When it is upset. But not often. And… I think that is all. Just the aches pill and the stomach pill. And the water pill. My wife keeps track of everything. I forget. She is very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. You are the doctor. You need to check. I trust you. But… will it hurt? I don’t like pain. Old man, you see. Everything hurts a little already. But if you need to check, then check. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. It won’t hurt at all. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower left side. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. And finally, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight enlargement of your prostate. That likely explains some of the urinary issues you’ve been experiencing. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, that concludes the exam. Everything seems generally okay, but we did find a few things that we'll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate? What do you mean? Is something bad? My prostate… is that bad? I just want to have a baby with my wife. Is that still possible? I am an old man, but… we still love each other very much. Please tell me it is still possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, let’s not jump to any conclusions. Finding an enlarged prostate is common in men your age, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It can contribute to urinary issues, which we discussed, but it's often manageable. As for having a baby with your wife, it’s still possible, but it may require some assistance. The first step is to get a clearer picture of your overall health and sperm quality. I’d like to order a few tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a sperm analysis. We’ll also want to get a PSA level, which is a blood test to screen for prostate cancer. And of course, we’ll need to consider your wife’s health as well. Do you have her primary care physician's information?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. That is good. We need to know. My wife… she has a doctor. Dr. Ramirez. She goes to her for everything. I will get you the information. Here. The name and number. She will be happy you want to talk to her. She worries so much. And… the sperm analysis… will that hurt? I am an old man, you see. Everything is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. I'll reach out to Dr. Ramirez to get a better understanding of your wife’s health. As for the sperm analysis, it won’t hurt at all. It’s a non-invasive test. You’ll simply provide a sample in a private room. There will be instructions given to you on how to collect the sample properly. It’s a bit awkward, perhaps, but it’s a very common test, and the lab technicians are very discreet. I also want to mention that given your age and potential health concerns, if you and your wife decide to pursue assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization , it would be wise to consult with a fertility specialist. They can provide more tailored guidance and support. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: No… no IVF yet. Not yet. Let’s just see what the tests say first. One step at a time, you see. If the tests are bad… then maybe we talk about IVF. But first… the tests. Do you think… do you think there is still a chance? Even if I am an old man? My wife… she really wants this. And I… I want to make her happy. That is all that matters.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, age is just a number. While it certainly presents some challenges, it doesn’t automatically rule anything out. Many couples have successfully started families later in life. We’ll gather all the information we need, assess your overall health, and then we can discuss all your options. I'll order those tests right away and get the requisitions to you before you leave. I’ll also give you a list of labs where you can get them done. I want to be upfront and let you know that the sperm analysis may take a little longer to process. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re in this together. We’ll do everything we can to help you and your wife achieve your dreams. Do you have any questions for me right now before we wrap things up?
PATIENT: No… no questions. You have explained everything very well. Thank you, Doctor Bacy. You are very kind. And… thank you for not laughing at an old man who wants a baby. I think… I think that is all. I will get the tests done right away. And I will tell my wife. She will be very happy. Thank you again, Doctor. You have given me hope. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was my pleasure meeting you. And please, don’t worry about a thing. There’s absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, take care of yourself and your wife. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
