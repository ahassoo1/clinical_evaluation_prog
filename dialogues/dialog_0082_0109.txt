DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now. Not all the time, but… comes and goes. Like a… dull ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, a headache, primarily at the back of your head, for about three days, coming and going. A dull ache, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Dull ache. Not… sharp. Not like someone hitting me. Just… there. Makes it hard to… focus sometimes. Especially when I'm… trying to remember things. Though, I remember most things, you know? Just… a little harder when the head hurts.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it's not a severe, sudden pain, more of a constant, bothersome ache. And it seems to be affecting your concentration a bit. Hmm. Now, can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Well… it’s funny you ask. Seems worse… when I’m resting. Like… after I eat lunch, and I sit down… or in the evenings. When I’m trying to watch the… the news. Doesn’t bother me so much when I’m… busy. When I’m working on things. I used to work with the… the trains, you know? Rail yard. Lots to do there. Keeps the mind busy. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: So it’s more noticeable when you’re relaxed, resting, or perhaps even quiet?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quiet… that’s a good way to put it. When things are… still. And… and sometimes when I bend over. Like to tie my shoes. Not every time, but… a few times now. A little… whoosh feeling with the ache. Is that… normal? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Brum, thank you. A whooshing sensation when bending over… that’s good information. Alright. Before we go any further, let me ask a few more general questions, just to get a better picture. Have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not like this. I’ve had… little headaches, you know? From the sun, maybe. Or when I’m… tired. But not this… dull ache in the back. And not with the… whoosh feeling. This is… new. Been a long time since I had a headache like this. Maybe… a long, long time. Before my wife… passed. It’s been a few years now.
DOCTOR: I see. So this is a new type of headache for you, and it started relatively recently. I appreciate you telling me that. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No… no fever, I don’t think. No… blurry vision. I can see just fine. No… dizziness, no throwing up. Nothing like that. Just… the ache. And a little… tired, maybe. But I’m an old man, Doctor. I’m always a little tired. It’s hard to say if that’s… part of the headache, or just… me.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Brum. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I used to have… high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor… he gave me some pills. I took them for a while. Then he said… it was okay to stop. Been… maybe ten years now? And… no other conditions. I eat pretty good, I think. Mostly… fish and vegetables. And I walk a lot. Keep moving, you know? That's what my wife always said. Keep moving.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure that was treated and is currently off medication. That's good to know. And you said you eat a healthy diet and stay active. Very good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. Just a little… flu, a few times. Nothing serious. My wife… she had some problems with her… her hips, a few years ago. But that was her. I… I've been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Brum. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not taking anything. Nothing at all. Not even… aspirin. I used to take a little something for my… my knees, a few years ago. But I stopped that too. The doctor said it wasn't helping much. Just… stopped taking everything. Easier that way, you know? Less to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And you mentioned no allergies to any medications or anything else, correct?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had a problem with… with anything. Not food, not… not plants, not… nothing. I used to work with the… the trains, you know? Lots of dust and… things flying around. Never had a reaction to anything. Pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: You certainly seem to be, Mr. Brum. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. Just… let me know if it’s going to… hurt. Old bones, you know. Not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look at your eyes and ears, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Just… don’t be surprised if I’m a little… slow. And… I might need a little help getting up and down. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Okay… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your pupils and reflexes. Just follow my finger with your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just… let me know if it’s too bright. Old eyes, you know. Not as good as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Good. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Reflexes are present and equal bilaterally, though slightly diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Now, can you please close your eyes and extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just… be careful. Old bones, you know. Don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Arms are symmetrical, no significant weakness detected. You do have some slight tremor, but that's not necessarily concerning given your age and history. Alright, Mr. Brum, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears generally normal, although your blood pressure is a little elevated and you have some slight tremor. Now, based on everything you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing what we call a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by stress or fatigue. However, given your age and the recent onset of these headaches, I'd like to order a few simple tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… wise. Tests… rule things out. Good. I trust your judgment. What kind of tests? Nothing… too scary, I hope. Old heart, you know. Doesn't like surprises. Just… let me know what's involved.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. Nothing scary at all. I'd like to order a complete blood count – just to check for any signs of infection or anemia. And a basic metabolic panel – to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And finally, a CT scan of your head – just to rule out any structural abnormalities. The blood tests are simple – just a quick prick of the finger. The CT scan is a bit more involved – you'll lie on a table while a machine takes some images of your head. It's painless and doesn't involve any radiation. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: CT scan… images… no radiation… yes. That sounds… alright. A little worried about the… the machine, but… if you think it’s best… then I trust you. When can I get these tests done? I don't want to… delay things. Old bones, you know. Best to be… careful. And… how much will these tests cost? I'm… not insured, you see. It's… a little difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. We can schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, right here at the clinic. As for the CT scan, we can arrange for you to have it done at the hospital – it’s a relatively quick procedure. Regarding the cost, I’m aware you’re uninsured, and that can be a concern. Let me speak with our billing department and see what options are available to you. We may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. I'll have them contact you directly to discuss the details. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever – ibuprofen – to help manage the headache symptoms. It's available over-the-counter, and it should provide some relief. Do you have any allergies to ibuprofen or any other medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had a problem with… with ibuprofen. Took it a few times for my… my knees, a long time ago. So, ibuprofen… for the head. And… tests tomorrow. And… hospital later. You think it’s not… too serious? I worry sometimes. Old bones, you know. Easy to… break. And… this headache… it’s different.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. It's good that you haven’t had any issues with ibuprofen before. And you’re right to want to get this checked out. While this headache is different, the tests will help us determine the cause and ensure we're taking the right approach. Based on what we've discussed, it's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's always best to be cautious. To reiterate, we’ll start with the blood tests tomorrow morning. I’ll also get the billing department to contact you regarding the cost of the CT scan. I’ll have them reach out as soon as possible. In the meantime, take the ibuprofen as directed on the label. If the headache worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, or weakness, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that’s all. You’ve been very… thorough. And… kind. Old bones, you know. Need a little reassurance sometimes. Thank you. I’ll take the ibuprofen. And… I’ll wait for the billing department. And… I’ll see you tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's my pleasure. Take your time getting up. And remember, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before tomorrow. I’ll see you then. And please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
