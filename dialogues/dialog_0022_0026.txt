DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just so tired. More than usual, you understand. I used to be able to… well, I used to do things. Now, just getting up is an effort. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers? Something being high. I don’t rightly recall. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit blurry, Ardelle. That’s what I’m here for. The tiredness is definitely something we need to look into. And those “numbers” from the lab – yes, let’s try to piece those together. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just… regular tired, you know? It’s like… all my energy just… vanished. I try to do the garden, but I have to sit down every five minutes. My husband, Pemba, he helps, bless his heart. But I used to do it. And it's not like I've been doing much lately, either! It just… came on. Suddenly. It's… unsettling. And my muscles ache. Not all the time, but… enough to notice. It’s a bothersome feeling, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this sudden onset of fatigue, and associated muscle aches… and it's impacting your ability to do things you used to enjoy, even simple things like gardening. About how long ago did you notice this start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long ago? That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t… overnight, exactly. Perhaps… a month or so? Maybe two? Everything feels so… mixed up these days. It’s hard to keep track. Pemba says I’ve been quieter lately, too. He worries, you see. Always has been a worrier, that one. But I think it was… after that little cold I had. Not a bad one, just a sniffle, really. But maybe it stirred something up? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or two ago, starting potentially after a mild cold. That's helpful. And you mentioned being quieter – have you noticed any other changes, perhaps in your appetite, your sleep, or your mood?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite hasn’t been… brilliant, I suppose. Not that I’m not eating, but I don’t feel hungry much. Just pick at things, really. And sleep… oh, sleep is fine. I sleep alright, I think. Pemba says I snore, of course. Always has. But I don't wake up feeling rested, even if I’ve had a good eight hours. As for my mood… well, I’m not exactly a ray of sunshine, am I? But I’ve never been one for a lot of fuss. It's just… this tiredness. It saps your spirit, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly see how that would be. A decrease in appetite, no significant changes in sleep duration but not feeling rested, and a generally lower spirit – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s a long story. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in Bhutan, actually. Very simple operation, thankfully. And… I had a bit of trouble with my heart rhythm once, but that was… decades ago. They gave me some pills, and it sorted itself out. Honestly, I don't recall much else. I go to the doctor for my check-ups, of course, but nothing… major. Pemba keeps track of all that now. He's very good with paperwork. I just try to get on with things, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. We can certainly work with that. Gallbladder removal, a history of heart rhythm issues that resolved, and regular check-ups. Do you know what medication you were taking for your heart rhythm issues, or perhaps what your regular doctor has prescribed you recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the name of the pill? No, I haven't the foggiest. It was… small and white, I think? All these pills look the same, you know. And as for what my regular doctor prescribes… Let me see… He gives me something for my blood pressure, I believe. And… something for my joints. They ache sometimes, especially in the cold. But I couldn’t tell you the names of them if you paid me. Honestly, Pemba handles all that. I just take what he gives me, and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common to have trouble remembering medication names. That’s alright; we can look those up in your records. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Pemba says I'm remarkably robust, considering my age. Though I don’t feel very robust these days, I assure you. But no, no allergies. Not to my knowledge, anyway. We ate all sorts of things growing up in Bhutan, and I never had a problem. Perhaps a bit of an upset stomach now and then, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, before we move on, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a complicated one. My mother… she lived to a good age, thankfully. But she had… something with her heart, I think. A weak heart, Pemba says. And my father… he was a very strong man, a farmer. But he had trouble with his legs towards the end. Something with the circulation, I believe. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family history. Everyone gets old eventually, don’t they? It’s just… the natural order of things.
DOCTOR: You’re right, everyone does eventually. But sometimes these things can give us clues. So, a history of heart issues in your mother and circulation problems in your father. Now, to get a better understanding of things, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam… I suppose that’s sensible. I haven’t had one in… well, a while. Do you need me to… undress? It's rather chilly in here, you know. Though I'm not sure what difference it’ll make. Just get on with it, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just don't poke too hard, my insides aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Ardelle. You can leave your clothes on. I'll just need you to sit comfortably here. And I promise, no poking! Alright, Ardelle. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 85. Your heart sounds are regular, but a bit quiet. Your lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft, though slightly tender up here on the right side. Now, I want to order some blood tests to get a better picture of what's going on. This will help us rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and muscle aches. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers again. I don’t like numbers. A little elevated, you say? Is that bad? And my heart is quiet? That doesn’t sound right. Everything seems to be… failing, bit by bit. Blood tests… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. But honestly, I’ve never been one for hospitals and needles. They always make me feel faint. And I don't want to be a bother. But if it will help… yes, alright. Go ahead. Just try to be quick, will you? And tell me if it’s going to hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. It’s perfectly alright to feel anxious about blood tests. A little elevated blood pressure is common, and we can certainly address that. And your heart being quiet doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, it just means we need to investigate further. The blood tests are fairly routine, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It's a quick pinch, and it will be over before you know it. We're looking at a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D. I'll also order a sedimentation rate to look for any signs of inflammation. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you continue to rest, stay hydrated, and eat a healthy diet. We’ll get these results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. So many things to remember… rest, hydration, healthy diet… It's all a bit overwhelming, really. I suppose I can try. Though I haven’t much appetite these days, as I said. And all these tests… Will they tell me what’s wrong with me? Or just tell you more numbers? Honestly, I’d rather just know. Is it my heart? Is it my joints? Is it… something serious? I don't want to be a bother, but I just want to get to the bottom of this. It's just… unsettling, feeling so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration and anxiety, Ardelle. It is unsettling to feel this way, and you deserve answers. These tests aren’t just about numbers; they’re about understanding what’s happening inside your body so we can find the right solution. They will help us rule out potential causes, including heart issues, vitamin deficiencies, and other underlying conditions. It's too early to say definitively what's causing your fatigue. We need to see the results of these tests first. But I assure you, we’ll investigate everything thoroughly. And I'll explain everything to you in plain language, so you understand what's going on every step of the way. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those would be signs that we need to address things more urgently. Otherwise, we’ll await these results. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… chest pain… shortness of breath… That doesn’t sound good at all. I haven’t had any of that, thankfully. Just the tiredness… and the aching. I suppose… no. Not right now. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Although, I'm not sure I remember everything. I'll have to ask Pemba to write it down. He’s very good at that sort of thing. Thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not making me feel like a complete bother. It’s just… unsettling, feeling so… frail. I suppose I’ll go home and rest now. And wait for the numbers. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. It was my pleasure to meet you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And remember, feeling unsettled is perfectly normal when you're dealing with these things. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. .
