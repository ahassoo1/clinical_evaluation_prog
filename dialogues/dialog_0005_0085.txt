DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, it’s about my skin. It’s… patchy. Not all over, thankfully, but it’s quite noticeable, and my husband keeps mentioning it, so I figured I should get it looked at. It’s just… different shades, really. Like someone took a brush to it.
DOCTOR: “Patchy,” huh?
PATIENT: Yes, patchy. As in, not a uniform color. It’s… distracting, frankly. And it's not a recent thing, it's been developing slowly over… oh, I'd say the last six months, maybe? It's not painful, or itchy, or anything dramatic, just… visually unpleasant. I do keep a very good skincare routine, you understand. It’s not like I’ve been neglecting it.
DOCTOR: Six months, developing slowly… and no itching or pain. You said you have a good skincare routine?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Absolutely. I use a very gentle cleanser, a good quality toner – Ukrainian, naturally, those are the best – and a moisturizer with SPF every single day. I exfoliate once a week, very carefully. And I avoid the sun like the plague. It's simply not a good look. I assure you, doctor, I’m very diligent. It's that baffling.
DOCTOR: Right. So, diligent skincare… good. We'll need to figure out what's going on despite that. Have you noticed it getting worse recently, or has it been pretty consistent over those six months?
PATIENT: Consistent, I’d say. Perhaps very slightly darker in some spots, but nothing alarming. It just… hasn't improved. I’ve tried a few different creams, you know, just over-the-counter things, hoping to brighten it up, but they haven't done a thing. Honestly, I’m starting to think they're just wasting my money.
DOCTOR: Okay. And where exactly are you noticing these patches?
PATIENT: Mostly on my face, I suppose. Forehead, around my mouth… a bit on my cheeks. Not symmetrical, which is what bothers me most. And a tiny bit on the backs of my hands, but that could just be age spots, I don’t know. Honestly, doctor, I'm not a medical professional. I just know it looks… uneven. And frankly, a little dull. It doesn’t suit me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look. If you don’t mind, I'm going to need to examine your skin. Please, have a seat on the examination table and we’ll get started.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I do hope you won’t find anything too dreadful. It’s probably just something superficial, I’m sure. Do let me know if the light is too bright. I have sensitive eyes, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Now, if you could just relax. I’m going to start with your face. Let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There is some discoloration, mostly on the forehead and around the mouth, as you mentioned. It's not raised, no scaling… Texture feels normal. The discoloration is… subtle, but definitely present. It’s not what I’d expect with a simple sunburn or age spot, to be honest. And yes, some mild discoloration on the dorsal hands. Let’s take a closer look under the magnified lamp.
PATIENT: Oh, good. You see it too, then. It’s not just my imagination. And “subtle” is putting it mildly, doctor. It’s… disheartening. A magnified lamp, you say? Is that… necessary? I hope it won’t make it look worse. Honestly, sometimes I think these things are best left unexamined. But very well, if you insist. Do be gentle, please. My skin is quite delicate.
DOCTOR: It’s not about making it worse, Ms. Bartock. It's about getting a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. I’m looking for specific patterns, textures… things the naked eye can’t quite pick up. Hmm. Yes. The pigment changes are… irregular. Not in a way that screams melanoma, thankfully, but definitely not typical. It looks almost… patchy, as you said. And there's a slight loss of pigment in certain areas. It’s not uniform. This isn't something I've seen frequently. Do you have any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, patchy is precisely the word! I told you. And family history… let me see. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something. A rash, I think. But she was a farmer, you know? Very rough hands, spent all day in the sun. It was probably just sun damage. And my uncle had eczema as a child, but he outgrew it, I believe. Nothing terribly serious. Honestly, we weren't a family that discussed such things. It was considered… indelicate. Does that help at all, doctor? Or is it just a collection of irrelevant details?
DOCTOR: A rash in the grandmother, eczema in the uncle… noted. It's not irrelevant. It helps me build a picture. Look, Ms. Bartock, this isn't a clear-cut case. The pattern is unusual, and I don't want to guess. I'm thinking we should do a skin biopsy just to be safe. It’s a quick procedure, we send a small sample to the lab, and they can tell us exactly what we're dealing with. It will rule out anything serious and give us a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh dear. That sounds… invasive. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be some sort of vitamin deficiency? Or a reaction to a new face cream? I assure you, I’ve tried many. I really dislike the idea of cutting into my skin unnecessarily. It's bad enough just looking at it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your hesitation, truly. But a skin biopsy is a very minor procedure. It’s a small sample, barely noticeable. It’s not about guessing. There are several possibilities here – a mild inflammatory condition, a pigmentary disorder, or… well, we need to rule out less common things. Relying on creams or vitamins without knowing the cause could just delay a proper diagnosis and potentially make things worse. It’s better to be certain. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was important. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But please, be gentle. And quick. The thought of having anything… removed from my skin is quite unsettling. Explain it to me, then. Everything. I want to know exactly what you're going to do. And how much it will… sting. Honestly, doctor, I have a very low pain tolerance.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s a very quick procedure. First, I’ll clean the area. Then, I’ll use a small, sterile blade – it’s not like a surgical knife, more like a tiny razor – to remove a very small sample of skin. It's usually only a few millimeters. You’ll feel a slight pinch, like a quick scrape, and then a little pressure as I apply a bandage to stop any bleeding. It usually takes less than five minutes. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and they’ll analyze it under a microscope. It takes about a week to get the results. The bandage needs to stay on for a few days, and you'll want to keep the area clean and dry. There might be a tiny scar, but it will usually fade over time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A tiny scar… that’s hardly reassuring. But I suppose a week is not an eternity. And you say it's quick. Will it… disfigure my face? Honestly, doctor, I’m very particular about my appearance. It’s not vain, it's just… important. And what if it is something serious? Will I need… treatments? Surgery? I really don’t want to think about that. Very well. If it truly is quick, and the sample is small… I suppose I can endure it. But please, be as gentle as possible. And promise me you'll explain the results thoroughly. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. I promise to be as gentle as possible. And I absolutely will explain the results thoroughly. No surprises, I assure you. We’re doing this to rule things out, and to get you a definitive answer. It's a small step to peace of mind. Let's get you comfortable, then. We’ll clean the area, and I’ll walk you through each step. I’ll start with a small area on your forehead. Are you ready?
PATIENT: As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Though I must warn you, doctor, if I faint, I would appreciate a glass of water. And perhaps a chair for my husband. He's terribly worried, you know. Proceed, then. Quickly, and gently. And please, tell me if it will hurt. I need to be prepared. Honestly, I've never been good with medical procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Just a quick cleanse here… this will feel cool. You may feel a slight pinch, like a mosquito bite, and then a little pressure. It will be over before you know it. And I'll be right here with you the whole time. Now, just a tiny sample here… deep breath… Alright, that's done. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That did sting. It wasn't as quick as you said. Is it… bleeding much? It feels rather tender. And what if it gets infected? Honestly, I’m starting to regret this whole ordeal. Perhaps we should have just left it alone.
DOCTOR: It's normal for it to sting a little, Ms. Bartock. And it’s just a tiny bit of bleeding, completely normal. The pressure will stop that quickly. It shouldn’t get infected, but keep it clean and dry. I’ll give you instructions for wound care before you leave. We’ll also cover the signs of infection, just in case. It’s unlikely, but better safe than sorry. It is a small procedure, and we’re taking all the precautions. Now, let’s just cover that up. There you go. All done. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: I feel… violated, if I’m honest. And rather tender. And anxious. Will it be visible? I have a dinner party on Friday. Honestly, a small scar would be disastrous. What are the chances it's something… serious? Don't sugarcoat it, doctor. I want the truth. Even if it’s unpleasant. And when will I get the results? A week, you said? Exactly a week? I need to plan my schedule. This is terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. To answer your questions directly: the bandage is small and discreet, and shouldn't be visible under normal circumstances. There's a very low chance it will leave a significant scar, but it's impossible to guarantee. Regarding the results, it should be exactly a week. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. As for the chances of it being serious… the vast majority of skin biopsies come back benign. We're doing this to rule out anything concerning. But it's important to remember that worrying won't help, and focusing on the positive is key. It's far more likely to be a minor skin condition than anything serious. Now, I'll write out detailed instructions for wound care, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Would you like me to also provide a referral to a dermatologist for a second opinion, just for peace of mind?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Well… I suppose it couldn't hurt. A second opinion is always wise. Honestly, I don’t trust these things easily. But make sure they are a reputable dermatologist. I don’t want just anyone poking around on my face. And what exactly is involved in the wound care? Is it complicated? I'm not particularly skilled in such matters. Honestly, my husband usually handles these things. Very well. Write out the instructions, and arrange the referral. But promise me, doctor, you’ll call me personally with the results. I don’t want to play telephone with a nurse. This is my face, you understand. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. I completely understand. I’ll personally call you with the results, as soon as they’re available. And I'll ensure the referral is to a highly reputable dermatologist. Dr. Anya Petrova – she’s excellent, very thorough. Here are the wound care instructions: keep the area clean and dry, avoid direct sunlight, and apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment twice a day. Change the bandage daily. If you notice any redness, swelling, or pus, contact me immediately. It’s generally a straightforward process, but I understand your concern. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, just to discuss everything in more detail. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Though I still feel rather… unsettled. A dermatologist and a follow-up appointment… honestly, it’s all rather overwhelming. Perhaps a glass of water would be helpful. And if you happen to have any calming herbal tea, that would be most appreciated. Honestly, I think I’m going to need it. Very well. A glass of water, and then I suppose I should be on my way. This has been… quite an ordeal. And please, do call me personally with the results. I cannot stress that enough.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. Let me get you some water right away. And I do have some chamomile tea in the break room, I’ll bring you a cup. Here you go. Please, take your time. And again, I will personally call you with the results. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before then. Is there anything else I can get for you?
PATIENT: No, thank you. That will be sufficient. I suppose I should be going now. This has been… rather draining. Very well. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your… patience. And please, do call me personally. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I will. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
