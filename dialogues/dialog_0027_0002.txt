DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that’s me. Hmm… what did bring me in? It’s… the pee, I think. It's hard to get it all out, you know? Like it’s stuck. Been like that a little while now. Not sure how long, exactly. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty with urination. And you said “a little while now”… can you try to remember roughly when you first noticed this becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Oh dear… dates. Always tricky. Let me think… was it before or after… oh, Agnes’s birthday? Agnes is my friend… she turned ninety… or was it eighty-five? No, no, it was after Agnes’s birthday… maybe springtime? Yes, springtime, I think. Or was it summer? Oh, it’s all a blur, really. Sorry, Doctor. I don’t have a good head for dates these days.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly understandable. So, sometime after springtime… let’s say roughly three or four months ago?
PATIENT: Three or four months… sounds right, maybe. Yes, it’s been that long, I reckon. It doesn’t hurt, not exactly. Just… takes a long time, and I have to push a little. And sometimes, it stops and starts, you know? Very annoying. My husband, he says I’m imagining things… but I know it’s not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, but difficulty starting, a weak stream, intermittency… and your husband doesn’t seem to think it’s a problem. Has this been getting progressively worse over these past few months?
PATIENT: Progressively… oh, is that like getting… badder? Yes, I think so. It is getting harder. I used to just go, you know? Now I have to… concentrate. And sometimes, I get a little worried I won’t be able to go at all. That's the scary part. It’s silly, I know, but… you can’t go all day without going, can you?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s a very reasonable concern. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. And yes, it’s important to address this. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, I’ve been a little more tired lately. But that could just be my age, couldn’t it? And I’ve been drinking a bit more water, because… because I’m thirsty, I suppose. Does that count as a change? And… oh! I’ve been getting up more at night to use the bathroom. That’s a change, for sure. Used to sleep right through. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, increased water intake, and nocturia – getting up at night to urinate. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, do you have any history of diabetes, or has anyone in your family been diagnosed with it?
PATIENT: Diabetes… now, that’s a word I’ve heard. My sister, Beatrice… she was a bit sickly, yes. She went to the hospital a lot. But I don’t think it was diabetes. Maybe her heart? She had a weak heart, I believe. I don't think I have diabetes, Doctor. I’ve never been told I do. But… well, I don't go to the doctor much, you know? I try to stay strong. Old-fashioned, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… just a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. My husband gives it to me. And… sometimes, a painkiller for my knees, when they’re acting up. But not all the time. Allergies… no, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Unless you count that rash I got when I was a little girl… from poison ivy, I think. But that doesn’t count, does it?
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, occasional painkiller for knees, no known drug allergies. Alright, Ms. Stoffregen, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your abdomen and a neurological exam. It will help me understand what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Yes, yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind at all. Just don’t poke too hard, dear. My skin is a bit thin these days. And… Will it take long? I have a tea date with Agnes later. She makes a lovely coconut cream pie. I wouldn’t want to miss that! But go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I'll try not to take too long. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I’m just going to press on your abdomen here. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. ...Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I do feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen. And I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Sounds are normal. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Could you cross your legs for me?
PATIENT: Oh, all right, crossing them now… It's a bit hard these days, my joints aren't what they used to be. Fullness, you say? Is that bad? I do feel a bit…bloated sometimes, especially after I eat. But I thought that was just my age! A little tender there, yes, on the left side. Not much, but… there. What are you looking for, Doctor? I always worry when someone is poking around. Is it serious? Agnes always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me about the tenderness, Ms. Stoffregen. It's helpful. And no, it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, but it’s something we need to investigate. The fullness could be related to a number of things, including bloating, constipation, or something else. Alright, everything seems normal neurologically. Your reflexes are intact, and your sensation is good. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis, just to check for infection or other abnormalities in your urine. And a basic blood test to check your kidney function and rule out anything else that might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urinalysis and a blood test…oh dear, that sounds…complicated. But…if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, all right. I trust your judgment. Is it going to hurt? I hate needles, you know. Agnes had to hold my hand when I got my flu shot last year. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game on Friday, and I wouldn’t want to miss that either. Hopefully, it's nothing serious, right, Doctor? Just old age catching up with me?
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a quick pinch, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s over very quickly, and the phlebotomist is very good. We'll try to make it as painless as possible. And we typically get the results back within a few days, hopefully before your bridge game. I’m ordering the tests now. While we wait for the results, let’s try to address your symptoms. I recommend increasing your fluid intake, and keeping a bladder diary – writing down when you go to the bathroom, and how much you drink. It can help us identify any patterns. And in the meantime, if you experience any fever, pain in your back or side, or difficulty breathing, please contact the office immediately. It could be something simple, as you said, but it's important to rule out anything serious. Once we have the results, we'll be able to make a more informed decision about the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A bladder diary… writing it all down. That sounds like a lot of work, dear. But if you think it will help… all right, I’ll try. Fever, pain… oh dear, I don’t want any fever! And Agnes would be so worried. Hmm… I suppose I do have one question. You said “rule out”. What are you trying to rule out exactly? Is it something bad? Don’t tell me if it’s scary, dear. I get anxious easily. I just want to know if I need to cancel my tea date with Agnes. And my bridge game. And… everything! Is it something contagious? I wouldn't want to get Agnes sick.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Stoffregen. I want to be completely transparent with you, but I also don’t want to cause unnecessary worry. We’re checking for a few things. One possibility is a urinary tract infection, which is very common and usually easily treated with antibiotics. Another possibility is bladder weakness or overactivity, which can cause the symptoms you're experiencing. In rare cases, it could be something more serious, like a blockage or even bladder cancer. However, it’s very unlikely to be anything that serious, and the tests will help us determine what’s going on. And no, it’s not contagious. So Agnes is perfectly safe. The most important thing right now is to get these tests done, so we can figure out what’s causing your symptoms and get you feeling better. I truly don’t think it’s anything to panic about, but it’s always best to be thorough. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in, and I’ll answer all your questions then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a urinary tract infection… that doesn't sound so bad. I’ve heard of those. Agnes had one last year, I think. And bladder weakness… well, I am getting old, aren’t I? Yes, yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Tests, then a discussion. And no, it’s not contagious. That’s good. I wouldn’t want to worry Agnes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for not making me panic. I do get anxious easily, you know. Now… where do I go for these tests? And will they be able to tell me if I need to cancel my tea date? It’s coconut cream pie, you see. Agnes makes it special.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will check you in and take your order. It's just a urine sample and a blood draw, so it shouldn’t take long. As soon as the results are available – usually within a few days – my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. At that appointment, we’ll discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. As for your tea date… hopefully, you won’t need to cancel! But we’ll know more once we have the results. Don’t worry too much, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take good care of you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, dear. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I’ll go and get these tests done. Hopefully, they won’t poke too much. And… Please tell Agnes I said hello, if you happen to see her. She volunteers here sometimes, you know. She makes the best coconut cream pie in the world. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be sure to tell Agnes. And I hope everything goes smoothly at the lab. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. .
