DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Auelua, you said? Fancy name. Well, it's not a serious problem, not like a broken bone or anything. I just...I need a little something from you. A card, really. A "Get Well" card. Or maybe one that just says "You're doing great!" My daughter thinks I should come get one from a real doctor. She says it'll mean more.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. A medical note for encouragement... that's... unusual, but certainly not something I haven't heard before. I’m happy to help if I can. Just so I understand, is there a specific reason your daughter thinks a note from a doctor would be particularly helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, she just thinks everything I do needs some kind of official stamp of approval. Honestly, she babies me something awful. It's a long story, involving her husband and a bad investment…never mind. The point is, she said you writing it makes it…legitimate. You know, shows I’m actually trying to get better. Even though I am perfectly fine. Just a little…low spirits, I suppose. Is that enough for a card? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you're feeling a bit down, and sometimes a little encouragement can make a big difference, especially if it comes from a trusted source. We’re here to support your overall wellbeing, and that includes emotional health. To make sure I write something appropriate, could you tell me a little bit about what's been going on – what’s been causing these low spirits?
PATIENT: Oh, it's everything, Doctor. Everything! My son-in-law lost a good chunk of money on…well, let's just call them “ventures.” My daughter is beside herself, taking it out on everyone. And then my neighbor’s dog won’t stop barking. And the price of tomatoes is outrageous! It’s just…a lot. It’s not like I’m ill, you understand. I just need a little…validation. That a good doctor thinks I’m doing alright, even with all this…nonsense. A card will do nicely. Something cheerful. Not too flowery, though. I don’t like frills.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A lot going on, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel down when life throws a lot at you. It sounds like you’re coping with some stress at home and in your daily life. Before I write the note, just to be thorough, can I ask a few quick questions about your health in general?
PATIENT: Health? What do you need to know about my health? I told you, I’m fine! Perfectly fine. Are you suggesting something is wrong with me? Because my daughter is going to hear about this. She already thinks I need to see a specialist for my…well, never mind. Just write the card, Doctor. A cheerful card. And make sure it says “doing alright.” That’s all. I don't need a full examination over a few tomatoes and a barking dog. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Please don’t be alarmed. It’s just standard practice. I’m not suggesting anything is wrong, I simply want to get a complete picture to make sure I write the most appropriate note for you. Just a few quick questions about any medical conditions you have, medications you’re taking, things like that. It'll take just a minute or two. For example, do you have any ongoing health problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Goodness, no. I work with my hands all day! I assemble little…things. Delicate things. You need steady hands for that. Well, my knees get a little creaky sometimes. But that's just old age, Doctor. Everyone gets creaky knees. And no, I don't have high blood pressure. I don't yell much. And as for medications… …I take a little something for my digestion, sometimes. But it’s just an herbal remedy. My sister sends it from Nepal. It’s perfectly natural. Now, are we finished with the interrogation? I'm starting to feel quite uncomfortable. Just write the card, please. A cheerful card, saying I’m “doing alright.” Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly reasonable. Just a few more quick questions, then. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I eat everything. Spicy food, everything. Well, I did have a bit of a reaction to some lotion my daughter gave me last year. It made my skin itch. But that’s just because she buys everything with too much perfume in it. Are we still on this, Doctor? I came for a card, not a medical history lesson. I’m a perfectly healthy woman. A little stressed, perhaps. But healthy. Can we please just get this over with? My daughter is expecting me back soon. And she’ll want a full report. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No problem at all. It sounds like you've got a good understanding of your own health, and you're quite resilient. Just to clarify, no known allergies, you take an herbal remedy for digestion, and you're feeling a bit stressed. I'm happy to write a note for you saying that you are "doing alright" despite some life stressors and that I support your wellbeing. Would you like me to mention anything specific, like your resilience or your active lifestyle?
PATIENT: Resilient? Oh, you can say that. I am quite resilient. And mention the assembling. It keeps my hands busy, you know? Prevents me from worrying too much. And… perhaps a line about how I’m a healthy woman overall? Just to contradict my daughter. She’ll love that. No need to mention the knees, though. That's between me and my chair. Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Perfect. Now, when can I have the card? I'm sure it'll cheer me up immensely. And my daughter, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let me just jot this down… “To whom it may concern: I have had the pleasure of speaking with Janeth Micucci today. She is a resilient individual actively managing life stressors and maintaining good overall health. Her work with delicate assembly demonstrates focus and dexterity. I support her wellbeing and commend her positive outlook.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… "Positive outlook"? That's a bit…much. I am realistic, you know. And “commends”? That sounds terribly formal. Perhaps…change "commends" to "supports"? And remove “positive outlook.” It's a bit…over the top. Yes, that's much better. Much more…accurate. Now, can I have it? And is it official-looking? My daughter insists on official-looking things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. "To whom it may concern: I have had the pleasure of speaking with Janeth Micucci today. She is a resilient individual actively managing life stressors and maintaining good overall health. Her work with delicate assembly demonstrates focus and dexterity. I support her wellbeing." Is that official enough?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! That’s exactly what my daughter wanted! Official-looking, with the stamp and everything. She’ll be so pleased! Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. Although…a bit overly thorough, perhaps. But I suppose that’s what doctors are for, isn’t it? Well, I should be going. My daughter is probably wondering where I am. And I need to show her this! Thank you again, Doctor Auelua. Goodbye!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to prioritize self-care and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. And give my best to your daughter! Have a wonderful day, and take care!
