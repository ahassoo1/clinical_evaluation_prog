DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Hernandez. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My blood pressure has been… not good. And lately, I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. It worries me. I wish to be quick, if possible. My time is… valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Not a problem at all – we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. High blood pressure and some memory concerns… alright. Let's start with the blood pressure. How long have you been noticing it's been high?
PATIENT: Oh, it has been… approximately six months, I believe. Perhaps a little longer. The numbers… they were quite alarming when I checked at the pharmacy. I do not recall the exact numbers, but the pharmacist… she looked concerned. I have been taking pills… blue ones… but they do not seem to help much. It fluctuates, you see. Sometimes fine, sometimes… not.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of fluctuating blood pressure, despite taking blue pills… Do you happen to know the name of those blue pills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. My husband… he always handled the medications. He… passed away last year. I simply take them as the… the nice woman at the pharmacy instructs. I apologize. I am not good with these things. It is a small, blue pill. That is all I know, truly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Venus. That's perfectly alright. We can figure it out. It’s common to get overwhelmed with medications. Let’s focus on getting a good understanding of what’s happening now. You mentioned memory concerns. Can you give me some examples of the small things you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes. Well… yesterday, I went to the market. I had a list. A very specific list. But I… I forgot the apples. Completely. And then… last week, I scheduled a meeting with the landscaping company, but I wrote the time down incorrectly. They arrived two hours early. It is… frustrating. And worrisome. It was never like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting items at the market, a scheduling mix-up… and you're saying this is a new development?
PATIENT: Yes, quite new. Perhaps… four months, maybe five? It started small. Misplacing keys, forgetting a name… but it is becoming more frequent. And… more important things. I worry it is… something serious. I do not wish to be a bother, Doctor, but it does frighten me, this forgetting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venus. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. Let's do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Only the high blood pressure, Doctor. And… arthritis, in my knees. It is… uncomfortable, but manageable with medication. My husband… he always said I was remarkably healthy, for my age. He would be… upset to see me like this. I do not believe I have any other conditions. I have not seen a doctor regularly since… since he passed.
DOCTOR: Alright, just high blood pressure and arthritis. And haven’t seen a doctor regularly since your husband passed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I eat… most things. I have never had a reaction to any medication. My husband… he always asked when filling prescriptions, and they said I was clear. It is… difficult to remember everything. But I am certain I have no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned taking blue pills for your blood pressure. Let's try to identify those. Do you still have the bottle?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I do. Here. It is… quite full. I suppose I do not take them as often as I should. It says… "Lisinopril" and "20mg". Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Venus. Lisinopril 20mg. Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or Alzheimer’s?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother… she had heart problems. A weak heart, the doctors said. She passed away when she was… seventy-two, I believe. And my aunt… on my father’s side… she developed… what was it… confusion. The doctors said it was… something with the brain. A very sad thing. She forgot everything, eventually. It frightened us all. I do not know the specific names of their illnesses, Doctor. I apologize. It was long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Venus. Any information is helpful. Heart problems in your mother and confusion in your aunt… Okay. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I live alone, as you know. I manage several properties, so I am quite busy. Always running around, dealing with tenants, overseeing repairs… It keeps me active, I suppose. I do not smoke, and I drink… occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. I try to eat healthy, but it is difficult when I am always on the go. It is… a solitary life, mostly. But I keep busy. Is that… sufficient information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Venus. Thank you. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. I would like to be quick, if possible. I have appointments later this afternoon. But yes, please proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is currently 150/90, which is elevated. Your heart sounds a little fast, but regular. Lungs sound clear. During the neurological exam, I noticed a slight difficulty with recall when I asked you to repeat three unrelated words after a short delay. It's subtle, but worth noting. I'm going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, thyroid levels, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. We'll also want to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Finally, I would like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it truly necessary? I am not fond of… machines. But if you believe it is essential… yes, I suppose. The blood work… that is acceptable. The EKG… I will comply. But the MRI… is there truly no other option? It sounds… frightening. Perhaps we could discuss the results of the blood work first?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Venus. An MRI isn’t pleasant, but it provides valuable information. It's the best way to rule out any underlying causes for your memory issues, like a small stroke or other structural problem. It’s better to be thorough, especially given your family history and recent symptoms. We can certainly discuss the blood work results first. However, the MRI will likely be the most important test in determining the cause of your memory problems. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it will give us peace of mind. We can schedule the MRI for next week. It'll take about 30-45 minutes. You'll lie still inside a scanner, and it's a bit loud, but you'll have headphones to wear. For now, let's focus on the blood work and EKG. I'll write you a lab order. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe so. You have explained everything… adequately. I simply… dislike machines. And the thought of something… wrong… is unsettling. Very unsettling. The blood work and EKG… yes, I will comply. And then… the MRI. I suppose I have no choice. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I wish it were not necessary, but… I understand. Just… please, schedule it for as soon as possible. I do not wish to prolong this anxiety.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. I completely understand. I'll have the lab order printed for you now, and the receptionist will schedule the EKG and MRI for as soon as possible – likely early next week. In the meantime, let's talk about managing your blood pressure. Since the Lisinopril doesn't seem to be fully effective, we'll need to adjust your medication. I'm going to add a low dose of Amlodipine to your regimen. It's a different type of blood pressure medication that works in a different way. I'll write you a prescription for Amlodipine 5mg, to be taken once daily. Also, try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your routine. Things like gentle exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature can help lower your blood pressure. Do you have any questions about the new medication or the stress-reducing tips?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… Yes, that is… another name. Is it safe? I do not wish to experience… side effects. And stress-reducing activities… I manage properties, Doctor. My life is stress. But I will… attempt it. Is there anything specific I should watch for with the Amlodipine? Anything that warrants… immediate attention? I do not wish to be a bother, but I prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Venus. Amlodipine is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have side effects. The most common ones are swelling in your ankles and feet, dizziness, and headache. If you experience any of these, let me know. More serious, but rare, side effects include chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. If you experience any of these, go to the emergency room immediately. Also, Amlodipine can interact with certain medications, so it's important to let me know if you're taking any other drugs, even over-the-counter ones. I'll also provide you with a written list of potential side effects and interactions. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is… sufficient. The side effects… I will be vigilant. And I will inform you of any other medications I may be taking. You have been… very thorough. I appreciate your patience. I suppose… this concludes our visit? I wish you a good day. And thank you… again. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Venus, I believe it does. I'll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks after your MRI to discuss the results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. You have a good day too, and remember to take things one step at a time. Take care. .
