DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor, and it’s… different. It’s not worse, exactly, just different than what I usually smell like. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to explain. Usually, I just smell… like me, you know? Kind of a neutral, clean smell. Now it’s… almost sweet? Not like perfume sweet, but… a little bit like fruit, maybe? It’s not strong, but I definitely notice it when I get out of the shower, and sometimes after work. I do a lot of physical labor, so I sweat a lot, obviously. But this is different with the sweat.
DOCTOR: Okay. A change in body odor, particularly a sweeter scent, is…unusual. And you say this started a few weeks ago, coinciding with your usual activity level. Do you notice it at all other times, or is it primarily after exertion?
PATIENT: Mostly after exertion, yeah. Like after work, definitely. And sometimes after I’ve been gardening, which I love to do. But… now that you mention it, I think I noticed it a little bit this morning, even before I did anything. It was very faint, though. I thought maybe it was just my imagination, or the soap I used. But it was there. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other changes recently, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. No fever, no weight loss or gain that I’ve noticed. My appetite's been normal. Hmm… oh! I have been a little more tired than usual, but I just figured that was from working so much in the heat. I've been sleeping okay, though. And no changes in my diet, nothing like that. I haven’t started any new medications or anything either. I'm on Medicare, so my prescriptions are pretty stable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, stable weight, normal appetite, fatigue potentially related to heat exposure, and no medication changes. And you're on Medicare, so we have a good record of your current medications. Just to confirm, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve got a bit of dust allergy, you know, with the work, but that's just sneezing and a runny nose, nothing serious. No food allergies, no drug allergies… just the dust. I've been pretty lucky in that regard, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your overall condition. It’s unlikely to be directly related, but it's best to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Let me just take off my jacket…
DOCTOR: If you'll just change into the gown, we can get started. I'll need you to lie down on the table. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’ll quickly check your thyroid and do a general skin exam.
PATIENT: Okay. I’ll be right back. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee, if you could lie flat on your back, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take some deep breaths for me. In… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. That doesn't sound too bad, right? Everything clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, so far so good. Now, I’m just going to feel your neck, checking your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules palpable. Now, let me just quickly examine your skin. Skin appears normal, no concerning lesions noted. Alright, Ms. Purtee. Everything appears normal on initial examination. However, given the change in body odor, and the fact that it’s persisting, I think it's best to run some blood tests just to rule out any underlying metabolic issues.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Blood tests… what kind of things are you looking for? I don’t want to worry unnecessarily, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Purtee. We're not necessarily looking for anything specific at this point, it's more of a screening process. We'll check your complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel—that looks at your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar—and a thyroid panel to ensure your thyroid is functioning optimally. We’ll also check a TSH level. Sometimes, subtle hormonal imbalances can cause changes in body odor. It's unlikely, given your normal thyroid exam, but we want to be thorough. We may also consider checking a urine analysis to rule out any underlying infection. It's standard procedure, given your symptom and to provide peace of mind. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that actually sounds pretty comprehensive. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary, let’s do them. I just want to get to the bottom of this. When can I get those done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a lab requisition now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can usually accommodate walk-ins. I recommend going today if possible, so we can get the results back quickly. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. No questions right now. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Purtee. It’s most likely something benign, but it’s best to rule out anything serious, as you said. The nurse will explain the process to you. Once the results are back—usually within 24-48 hours—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—fever, unexplained weight loss, excessive fatigue—please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here’s the requisition, and the nurse's station is just outside the door.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go see the nurse now. .
