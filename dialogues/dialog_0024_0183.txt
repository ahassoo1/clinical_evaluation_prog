DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, good morning. It’s… this tiredness. Always tired. Like… heavy. Very heavy. It's been a while now, not just today. I don’t… I don’t do much, so it’s not like I’m working hard. It just… is.
DOCTOR: "Heavy," you say. A vague descriptor, Mr. Grumman. Can you quantify this "heaviness"?
PATIENT: Quantify? What does that mean? Like… how much? I just… I wake up tired. I go to bed tired. Even sitting… is tiring. I used to… well, never mind. It’s just… a lot. More than it should be, yes? It’s not normal.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's attempt to establish a timeline. Approximately how long have you been experiencing this… persistent fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around November, I think. Yes. November. The rain started then, and… everything just felt harder. Not suddenly, but… slowly. It got worse with the cold. And it hasn't really gone away. It just… stays.
DOCTOR: Six months. And has anything specific changed in your life during that time?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Same house, same wife… same everything. Maybe… the bakery down the street closed. That was a good bakery. But… that doesn’t make me tired. No. Everything is… the same. Just… I feel worse. Inside. It’s… difficult to explain. You wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Grumman, my profession necessitates understanding. However, your descriptions are… lacking in precision. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get… hungry. Everyone gets hungry. And… sometimes my stomach feels… upset. Not bad, just… uncomfortable. And I… I don't sleep well. I wake up a lot. But everyone wakes up sometimes, yes? Is that a symptom? It’s… complicated. It's not one thing. It’s many things. Small things. Annoying things. Things that add up.
DOCTOR: "Small things," you say. Let us attempt a systematic review. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I don’t… weigh myself. Not often. My wife does, sometimes. She says… she says I'm too thin. She worries. But I’ve always been thin. It’s just… more noticeable now, I think. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat everything. Some days I don’t want anything. It’s… unpredictable. Like the weather. You ask a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable. Very well. And any difficulties with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what? You are asking very personal things. Is this necessary? I mean… it’s… fine. Mostly. Sometimes… a little hard to go. Not always. But it's not a big problem. Really. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Is this tiredness… is this what you are trying to figure out? Or just… everything else?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, a comprehensive assessment requires detailed information. We must rule out any underlying causes. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… sometimes I’m cold, but that’s just the house. It’s an old house, drafts everywhere. Night sweats? I sleep with a blanket, of course. Everyone sleeps with a blanket. Unexplained weight loss… my wife says I’ve lost weight, but I haven’t noticed. I don’t weigh myself! This is… frustrating. You are asking about things I don’t pay attention to. I just want to know why I am tired. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Chronic… what? No. Never. I’ve always been healthy. Mostly. A little cough sometimes. Old age, yes? My wife… she worries too much. No illnesses. No hospitals. Just… this tiredness. It’s new. And it's… annoying. It’s ruining everything. I used to… never mind. It doesn’t matter now. I just want to feel normal again. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Normal. We shall attempt to ascertain what that entails. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you. No surgeries. No hospitals. I don’t… do hospitals. Bad place. My mother… she was sick, a long time ago. In the hospital. It was… unpleasant. No. I have never been in a hospital. Just… me. And this tiredness. Is there anything else you need to know? I am starting to get… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. Both gone. My father… a long time ago. Heart, I think. My mother… longer ago. Sickness. A bad sickness. It was… difficult. We didn’t have good doctors then. Not like now. Just… gone. They are gone. What does this… matter? It doesn’t change anything, does it? I am tired. They are gone. I am tired. It’s… simple.
DOCTOR: Simple, you say. Let us establish your social history, then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for you. Alcohol… sometimes. A little wine with dinner. My wife likes it too. Not much. Just a glass. Maybe two. Recreational… what? No. I don’t… do those things. I am a simple man. I live a simple life. Wine with dinner. That's it. Nothing else. Are we getting anywhere? This is… frustrating. I just want to know why I am tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. My wife gives me something for my cough sometimes. A red pill, I think. Never had any… reaction. I just… get sleepy. But I always get sleepy. It doesn’t mean I am allergic. No. No allergies. Just… tiredness. It's always tiredness. Is this… helping? You are asking so many questions. It’s… exhausting. Really exhausting.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed to a brief physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Palpate? What does that mean? I don't like being touched. But… fine. If you must. Be gentle. It hurts sometimes. Just… be gentle. And hurry. This is… unpleasant. I don’t like doctors.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but regular. Lung sounds are clear. Your abdomen is soft, with some tenderness in the lower quadrants. No palpable masses. Blood pressure is 130/80. Temperature is 98.6. These findings are… non-specific.
PATIENT: Non-specific? What does that mean? It means… nothing is wrong? I am just tired? Is that all? This is… disappointing. I came here for answers, not… non-specific findings. Is there anything else you can do? Anything else you can check? I don’t want to just… be tired.
DOCTOR: We can order some basic bloodwork. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests… perhaps a Vitamin D level. It’s a standard workup to rule out common causes of fatigue. However, I must caution you, Mr. Grumman, these tests may not reveal a definitive answer. Fatigue can be… complex. And sometimes, it is simply… a part of getting older.
PATIENT: Simply getting older? I am not just old! I am… I am still useful. I have… things to do. I may not work anymore, but I… I have responsibilities. This is… insulting. Are you saying I am just tired because I am old? I want to know why. Not… just told to accept it. I want to know what is wrong with me. Is there anything else you can do? Anything more thorough? I don't trust this "simple" bloodwork. It won't find anything. It never does.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your frustration. However, we must be pragmatic. Extensive and unnecessary testing is not only costly, but can also lead to false positives and further anxiety. A more… comprehensive workup, as you suggest, would necessitate referral to a specialist – perhaps a hematologist or an endocrinologist. But frankly, given your non-specific symptoms and unremarkable physical exam, I doubt it would yield any significant findings. We can proceed with the basic bloodwork, and if that is unrevealing, we can consider a referral. But I must manage your expectations. Sometimes, the answer is… there is no readily identifiable answer. I will order the tests now. You can have them drawn at the lab downstairs. The results will take approximately three to five business days. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Three to five days? And it probably won't find anything. You think I am wasting my time. No. No further questions. Just… order the tests. And thank you… I suppose. I will… go to the lab. .
