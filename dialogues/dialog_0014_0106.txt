DOCTOR: Alright, Louine, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it’s not getting any better. Honestly, I thought it would just go away, you know? But it hasn’t. It's a sore, right here on my heel.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. Maybe…six weeks? It's hard to say exactly. Time just…slips away when you get to be my age. But it started as just a little bit of redness, and now…well, now it’s a proper hole. And it hurts. Not constantly, but when I put any weight on it, goodness gracious. It’s quite unpleasant. I’ve tried putting ointment on it, whatever my daughter had in the house, but it hasn't done a thing.
DOCTOR: A “proper hole,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Don’t look at me like that. It’s not a small thing. It’s…it’s like someone took a bite out of it. Not a big bite, mind you, but a noticeable one. And it’s…well, it’s weeping. A bit disgusting, really. I’ve always been very careful with my feet, you know. My mother always said clean feet were the sign of a respectable woman. I just don’t understand why this happened.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Louine, I see here you have a history of… peripheral vascular disease. And your weight is… significant. These things can contribute to foot problems, you know. We need to take a look at this. Let’s have you lie down on the exam table and I’ll take a look.
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re saying things. Significant? I’ve always been a large woman! It’s just…good bone. And peripheral vascular…that sounds dreadful. My daughter mentioned something about circulation, but I didn’t pay much attention. She always worries too much. I suppose I’ll lie down if I have to. But don’t expect me to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just…try to relax. I just need to take a quick look. Hmm. Yes. It is quite significant. There's some redness and swelling, as you said. And a small ulcer, approximately one centimeter in diameter. It appears to be… fairly deep. Your pulses are…weak, Louine. And your skin is cool to the touch. This suggests reduced circulation, which is what your daughter was likely concerned about.
PATIENT: Reduced circulation…see? I told you she worries too much. It’s probably just from sitting too long. I like my television. And I don’t move around as much as I used to, naturally. I’m eighty-nine years old, you know. Things wear out. Is it going to hurt to fix it? Because I really don’t want a lot of fuss. I have a bridge game on Thursday.
DOCTOR: Well, Louine, it’s not going to be a simple fix. The reduced circulation is a concern, and these ulcers can easily become infected. We need to rule that out first. I'm going to order some blood work to check for infection and assess your overall health. And I think we should get an X-ray of your foot to see if there’s any underlying bone damage. As for the bridge game… that may have to be put on hold for a bit. We need to prioritize getting this foot healed. And frankly, you shouldn’t be walking on it in this condition.
PATIENT: Put on hold? Put on hold?! That’s ridiculous. I haven’t missed a bridge game in…well, I don’t even remember how long! And blood work… honestly, poking and prodding is such a nuisance. I suppose I have no choice, do I? But I expect you to be quick about it. And no funny business with those needles. I have very sensitive skin. And I still think my daughter is overreacting about everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I’ve put in the orders for the blood work and X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll get you taken care of. The X-ray will be done after that. Here’s the paperwork. Once you’ve had the tests done, come back, and we’ll discuss the results. And Louine… it’s better to be cautious, you know. Especially at your age. I’ll also have the nurse come in and dress the wound with some antibiotic ointment in the meantime. It's just a precaution.
PATIENT: Antibiotic ointment… fine. As long as it doesn’t smell. I hate the smell of medicine. And don’t you tell my daughter I came. She’ll just fuss even more. Honestly, doctors these days… always rushing, always poking, always telling you what to do. And tell that nurse to be gentle. Very gentle. .
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. The nurse is very gentle. Just go down the hall to the lab and they’ll take it from there. .
