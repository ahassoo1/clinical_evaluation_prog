DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here… let me see… Ah, yes. I need to be certified for some help at home. For… well, for end of life care, if that makes sense. My daughter arranged this visit. She said I needed this… eligibility, she called it.
DOCTOR: Eligibility, yes, I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Your daughter is wise to get things sorted. It can be a complicated process. So, just to clarify, you're looking for certification to receive assistance at home related to end-of-life care. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… precisely correct. I am 54 years old, you see. And… things are becoming difficult. Very difficult. I do not wish to be a burden. My daughter… she works so very hard. She has children, you understand. This… this home help, it would alleviate some stress for her, I believe.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bahta. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider your daughter’s well-being as well. We want to make sure you have the support you need, and that she does too. To get started, perhaps you could tell me a little more about what's been difficult for you lately?
PATIENT: Well… where to begin? It is… a slow decline, you see. I am a surgeon. Pediatric surgeon. Always have been. But… my hands… they tremble now. I can no longer perform the… the delicate operations. It started small, a slight shake. Now… now it is quite pronounced. I had to… retire, six months ago. It was… devastating. Not just for me, but for my patients, you understand. And then… the fatigue. Constant fatigue. Even getting out of bed is… an effort. And… I have lost my appetite. I eat, but… it does not nourish me, if that makes sense. It’s all… very disheartening.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bahta. That sounds incredibly difficult. A significant change like retiring, especially after a career dedicated to helping others… and with those physical symptoms on top of it. It's completely understandable that you're feeling disheartened. So, to summarize, you’ve experienced increasing hand tremors, significant fatigue, and a loss of appetite over the past six months, leading to your retirement. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside those – anything with your memory, your mood, your sleep, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep… yes, my sleep is disturbed. I wake frequently, usually with… anxious thoughts. About… everything, really. My daughter, my career, the future. I do not sleep soundly. And my mood… I am not… cheerful, I suppose. I have always been a rather… stoic person, but lately, I find myself… irritable. Small things bother me that never used to. And… sometimes, I feel… very sad. But I try not to dwell on it. I do not want to be a burden. As for my memory… no, I believe my memory is quite good. I can recall… details very clearly. Dates, names… everything. It has not been affected.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Disturbed sleep with anxious thoughts, increased irritability, and episodes of sadness alongside the tremors, fatigue, and appetite loss. And thankfully, your memory seems to be holding steady. Have you seen a doctor about any of these symptoms before, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I saw Doctor… let me see… Doctor Dubois, my general practitioner. Six weeks ago. He ran some tests… blood work, I believe. And… a scan of my brain. He said… everything appeared normal. He suggested… perhaps it was stress. Retirement stress, he said. He prescribed… some medication for sleep. It helps a little, but… it is not a solution. It makes me… groggy in the morning. And… he did not seem to take my concerns very seriously. He dismissed it as… an adjustment period. I felt… rather unheard, if I may be so bold. That is why I sought a second opinion. My daughter suggested… you. She said you were… thorough.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta, I appreciate your trust. And I'm very sorry to hear you didn’t feel heard by Dr. Dubois. That’s certainly not the experience we want our patients to have. It’s important to me that we explore all possibilities and address your concerns thoroughly. Do you recall what specific blood tests were done, or do you have a copy of the results we could review?
PATIENT: Let me think… He did a complete blood count, I believe. And… a metabolic panel. Something about checking my liver and kidney function. And… he tested my thyroid. I do not recall the exact names, but he showed me the results. They were all… within normal ranges, he said. He wrote something on a piece of paper… a list of the values. I gave it to my daughter. She handles all the paperwork, you see. I am not very good with such things. Perhaps she has it. I can ask her. Would that be helpful, Doctor? I am sorry I cannot be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Mr. Bahta, thank you. Don’t apologize at all. Your daughter’s assistance is perfectly fine. It’s perfectly common for family members to help with these things. Now, just to get a broader picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I have been… remarkably healthy, all my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. A rather foolish accident, climbing a tree. I had my tonsils removed when I was in university. And… I had appendicitis when I was 30. That required surgery, naturally. But… other than that, I have never been seriously ill. No chronic conditions, no major surgeries. I do not take any regular medication, other than the sleep aid Doctor Dubois prescribed. I do not have any allergies. I do not smoke. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I am… a rather careful person, you see. I take care of myself. Or… I used to.
DOCTOR: That's a very good health history, Mr. Bahta – remarkably clean, as you say. No chronic conditions, no allergies, a limited surgery history. Now, regarding your family history… has anyone in your family experienced any significant medical conditions – things like tremors, memory problems, neurological disorders, or early-onset dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My parents… they both passed away several years ago. My father… he died of a heart attack, quite suddenly. He was a smoker, you see. My mother… she died of a stroke. She had high blood pressure. As for other conditions… my maternal grandfather… he developed some… confusion, in his later years. But I do not know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and my mother did not discuss it much. She said it was just… old age. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, she suffered from… arthritis, quite severely. But that is about all I can recall. No tremors, no memory problems… nothing like that. We are not a particularly… sickly family, you see. Or… we weren't.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart attack and stroke in your parents, some arthritis in your aunt, and confusion in your maternal grandfather. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your social history a bit. You mentioned being careful about your health. What does a typical day look like for you now, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Well… it is… rather quiet, these days. I used to wake early, go for a run, then head to the hospital. Long days, very demanding, but… rewarding. Now… I wake up when my daughter comes to check on me. She insists. I have breakfast – usually toast and tea. I read the newspaper. I try to… keep my mind active. I enjoy classical music. I used to garden, but… I find it difficult now. My hands… they tremble too much. I have lunch with my daughter, if she is available. In the afternoon… I often nap. I watch television. I try to… socialize, but… I do not have many friends. My wife… she passed away several years ago. And… my colleagues… they are all very busy. So… it is a quiet life. A very quiet life. I miss… the hospital, you see. I miss helping people. I feel… useless, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bahta. A significant adjustment after a demanding career and the loss of your wife. It sounds like you’re feeling a sense of loss, both professionally and personally. And it's completely natural to miss the fulfillment of helping others. Now, just to be thorough, and to have a complete picture, would you mind if I were to perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please, proceed. I understand it is necessary. I have nothing to hide, you see. I will do my best to… cooperate. Though… my hands may tremble. Do not be alarmed. It is… just a part of the condition, I suppose. Whatever you need, please just let me know. I want to understand… what is happening to me. That is all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bahta. I'll be mindful of your tremor. We'll take our time. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I'll do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not concerningly so. Your pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. And your respiratory rate is 16, normal. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears and nose appear normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am following it, Doctor. Though… it is a little difficult. My eyes… they feel a little tired, sometimes. But I am following it. Do you need me to… focus on something specific? Or just… track the movement? I am trying my best. It is… challenging, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, tracking the movement is fine, Mr. Bahta. You're doing very well. I notice a slight tremor in your gaze, which is consistent with your other symptoms. Now, if you'll close your eyes, I'm going to test your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, could you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger, and repeat?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… a little difficult, Doctor. My hands… they are trembling. As you can see. I am trying my best to… coordinate. But it is… challenging. I almost missed your finger. I apologize. It is… frustrating, you see. I used to be so precise. A surgeon's hands… they must be steady. This… is disheartening. Is it… very bad? Please be honest with me. I need to understand… what is happening.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bahta. Don’t apologize. You are doing very well, considering. I'm simply observing. And it’s important to be honest, so I will be. The tremor is significant, and it is affecting your coordination. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your age, the relatively quick onset of symptoms, and the tremor, we need to rule out several things. The first possibility that comes to mind is Essential Tremor, but that's often familial and usually doesn't include fatigue. Another possibility, though less common at your age, is Parkinson’s Disease, but that usually presents with more rigidity and slowness of movement. There are also some rarer neurological conditions that could be causing this, and some metabolic issues that could mimic these symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some further tests. Specifically, I'd like to order a complete blood count and metabolic panel – which, I believe, your daughter already has the results for - but I'd also like to order a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin B12 level. I would also like to consult with a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. Would you be open to seeing a neurologist?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Anything. Whatever you think is necessary. I am open to seeing a neurologist. Whatever tests you require, I will gladly undergo. I want to understand… what is happening to me. This… uncertainty is… distressing. The blood tests… my daughter has them, I believe. She will retrieve them. And… a neurologist, yes. Please, arrange it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want… answers. And… perhaps some hope. Is there… any hope? Is there anything that can be done? Please be honest with me. I need to know… what the future holds.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Mr. Bahta, and your desire for answers. It’s perfectly natural to feel uncertain and worried. There is absolutely hope. Many conditions can cause tremors, and many are treatable or manageable. Even if it is something more serious, there are medications and therapies that can help improve your quality of life. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but we will work together to find out. I will arrange a consultation with a neurologist right away. I’ll also review your previous blood work, once your daughter provides it. In the meantime, I would suggest trying to maintain a healthy diet, getting regular, gentle exercise if you’re able, and getting plenty of rest. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a low dose of Clonazepam, a medication that can help manage the tremor. It is a controlled substance, so we will start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. I’ll also provide you with a list of resources for people dealing with tremors and neurological conditions. And I want you to know that I’m here for you every step of the way. We will discuss everything, address your concerns, and make a plan together. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I do not think so. Not at this moment. You have… explained everything very thoroughly. A neurologist, the blood tests, the medication… It is… a lot to process. But I trust your judgment, as I said. Thank you, Doctor Iuzzolino. Thank you for… listening. And for taking the time. And for your… compassion. It means… a great deal. I will speak with my daughter, and we will arrange the appointments. And I will… try to remain optimistic. Though… it is difficult. Perhaps… just one small question. What… what is the typical timeframe for these appointments? How long will it take to… get a diagnosis? I am a rather… impatient person, you see. I like to have… a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could help. I understand your need for a plan, and your impatience. I'll do my best to expedite the process. I’ll call the neurologist’s office this afternoon and try to get you an appointment as soon as possible – typically within two to three weeks, but I'll push for sooner if I can. Once we have the results of the blood work and the neurologist’s evaluation, we should have a clearer picture within a few more weeks. It’s not an immediate answer, unfortunately, but we'll be working towards it diligently. I'll also provide you with my contact information, so you can reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… all. You have been… most helpful. And… reassuring. Thank you again. I believe… I shall leave you to your patients. You have a busy schedule, I imagine.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Bahta. I’ll be in touch soon. And please, take care. .
