DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… blood. In my cough. It started a few days ago, maybe three? It was not much at first, but it is… more now. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Blood in your cough… right. And you said three days ago it started. How much is “more now,” exactly?
PATIENT: Um… that is a difficult question. At first, it was just… a little streak. Like, when I use a tissue, a tiny spot. Now… maybe a teaspoon? Each time I cough, not every time, but often. It is… bright red. I hope that explains it. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: A teaspoon… bright red. Yes, that's… concerning. Have you been having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. No fever, I do not think. I have been… a little tired, but I always am, a little. No pain in my chest, no trouble breathing. Just the… blood and the tiredness. And maybe a little… weak? Is that a symptom? It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Weakness, okay. And how would you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: It is not like… after a long day of work, Doctor. I do physical therapy, so I expect to be tired after work. This is… all the time. Even when I rest. Like… my body feels heavy. And I have less energy to do things. Even things I usually enjoy. It is… frustrating, to be honest. Is this normal with the blood?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a… relative term. It's good you’re able to differentiate this from exertion. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I have been very healthy. Except… my husband… he passed away last year. He had… heart problems. But I do not have heart problems. And no asthma, no allergies… nothing else. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but that was a long time ago. I keep up with my check-ups.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never any surgeries. I have always been… lucky, I suppose. Nothing like that. Just… regular visits to the dentist. And the yearly check-ups, as I said. Is this… is the blood a sign of something very bad, Doctor? I am a little worried.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. Family history, then. Is there anyone in your family with a history of lung problems, bleeding disorders, or anything similar?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some trouble breathing when she was very old. The doctor said it was… emphysema? Or something like that. From smoking, I think. She stopped many years ago. My father… he was very healthy, I think. No problems. And my husband’s family… I do not know them very well. He did not talk about them much. He said there was… some heart trouble on his side. But nothing with lungs, I don’t believe. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. I do not smoke. My husband… he used to, but he quit when we met. It’s… a bad habit. And I have always been very careful to avoid it. I like being healthy. Well, trying to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin. And sometimes, when my muscles are sore after work, I take ibuprofen. But not very often. Just when I need it. And I use a cream for my hands, because they get dry. That is all. Nothing serious, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss what might be going on. Please sit up and I’ll listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I am ready. Just… please tell me if you see anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. A few scattered crackles bilaterally, but nothing alarming at this point. Your heart sounds normal. Now, let me check your oxygen saturation. 97%. That's good. Your blood pressure is 128/78, and your pulse is 72. I'll also palpate your lymph nodes. No swelling. Overall, everything seems… normal, but the blood is concerning, and we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: The blood… yes. That is what worries me the most. What kind of investigation? Do you think it is… serious? I am sorry to ask so many questions. I just… I want to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: We'll need to get a chest X-ray, to rule out any obvious issues like pneumonia or a tumor. And I'd like to order a complete blood count and a sputum analysis, to look for infection or other abnormalities. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to be thorough. I will also order a CT scan of the chest to get a more detailed look. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? Um… I do not think so. I have never had a CT scan before. I have never had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. No allergies to medications, no allergies to food… nothing like that. I am usually very careful about what I take. Is contrast dye something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard precaution. Most people tolerate it fine. We'll have you fill out a questionnaire before the scan just to be sure. I'm going to write you a referral to the radiology department. They'll schedule the X-ray, CT scan, and arrange for the sputum analysis. The blood count can be done here, today. I’ll also give you instructions on how to collect the sputum sample. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: So… X-ray, CT scan, blood test, and… collecting a sample? It sounds like a lot. The sample… is it difficult to collect? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a physical therapy appointment next week, and I don’t want to… miss it. Hopefully, it is nothing too serious, yes?
DOCTOR: The sputum sample requires a deep cough to produce enough material for analysis. The radiology department will give you detailed instructions. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the blood work to come back, and a bit longer for the imaging. I will contact you as soon as I have them. As for your appointment, hopefully this won't interfere. If the results are concerning, we may need to adjust your schedule. I'm prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a precaution, to cover for a possible bacterial infection. It's unlikely, but we want to be prepared. Take this with food, and complete the full course, even if you start feeling better. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: An antibiotic… so you do think it could be an infection? And… a full course, even if I feel better? That means… it could be something serious enough to need that? I understand you are being careful, but… is there anything else you can tell me? Anything that makes you think it is more likely to be one thing over another? I just… I like to know what I am facing, you understand?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Weichers, I understand your anxiety. The blood is concerning, and we need to rule out all possibilities. However, it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. The antibiotic is a precautionary measure, and the imaging will give us a much clearer picture. It could be a simple infection, or it could be something else. Until we have the results, it’s impossible to say. Frankly, worrying yourself sick won’t help. Follow the instructions, get the tests done, and we'll discuss the results when they're available. I don't want to speculate before we have concrete data. It wouldn't be responsible. Do you have any other questions regarding the paperwork or the collection process?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. I understand. I just… I wish I knew what was happening. Thank you, Doctor. I will get the tests done. I will… call if I have any questions.
