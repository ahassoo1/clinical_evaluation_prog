DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 72 years old. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-two. My husband and I… we are thinking about a place for me to live. A senior place. They need… a paper from the doctor, yes? To say I can go there.
DOCTOR: A medical assessment for placement, yes. I understand. To properly complete that, I’ll need some information about your current health status. It's not simply a matter of confirming you can move, but ensuring the facility is appropriate for any needs you may have. Let’s begin with why you are considering a senior living facility now?
PATIENT: It’s… the stairs, Doctor. In the house. Too many. My husband, he tries to help, but… he is not so young anymore, either. And I fall sometimes. Not bad falls, but… enough. It’s getting harder. We think a place with no stairs is best. And… people around. More people.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the primary concern is mobility and fall risk, coupled with a desire for increased social interaction. Have you had any recent falls, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Maybe… three months ago? I tripped on the rug in the living room. Nothing broken, just a little bruise on my hip. And… maybe one small one before that. I forget exactly when. Not very serious. My husband helped me up.
DOCTOR: "Not very serious" is subjective, Ms. Abdollahi. Even seemingly minor falls can indicate underlying issues. To get a clearer picture, can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… I wake up, usually around seven. I eat breakfast with my husband. Toast, coffee. Then I… I try to do some things around the house. Dusting, maybe. Sometimes I watch television. I cook dinner with my husband. Nothing much else. I sit a lot.
DOCTOR: And regarding your ability to perform daily activities before these falls began?
PATIENT: Before… Before, I did more. I used to go to the market, by myself. I cooked bigger meals. I cleaned the whole house. I… I gardened. I had a little garden with flowers. But it's been… a while since I did those things. It gets harder to bend down, you know? Things just… slow down.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll need to assess your current physical capabilities to determine the level of care that would be most suitable. Let’s start with a brief physical examination. Could you please stand up for me, when you are ready?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. But please, be careful. My knees… they are not so good.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Please, let's proceed slowly. Can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to balance, Doctor. A little bit. I feel… wobbly. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That was helpful. Your gait is unsteady, and you exhibit some balance issues. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… surprising. Is something wrong? It didn’t feel very strong, did it? Like… a little tickle, mostly.
DOCTOR: The reflex response is diminished, Ms. Abdollahi. That, combined with the unsteady gait, indicates some possible neurological involvement. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… not as strong as it used to be, Doctor. My hands… they get tired easily. I used to knit, you know. But I can't anymore. It hurts too much.
DOCTOR: I see. There is evidence of some joint degeneration, which is not unexpected at your age, but it's contributing to your decreased strength. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is everything alright? It feels… strange. I used to have a bad cough, a long time ago. But it’s gone now. My husband worries a lot about my breathing.
DOCTOR: Your lung sounds are clear at the moment, Ms. Abdollahi, but I do note a slightly elevated heart rate. Given your history of a cough and your husband’s concerns, I think it would be prudent to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms and ensure the senior living facility is adequately prepared to meet your needs.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? And blood work? Is something wrong, Doctor? Is it serious? My husband… he doesn’t like me to have tests. He says they worry him too much. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m not suggesting anything is seriously wrong, but we need a complete picture of your health. The chest X-ray will help evaluate your lungs, and the blood work will assess your overall organ function and identify any potential deficiencies or inflammation. It's simply a precaution to ensure you receive the best possible care. We need to determine if you have any underlying pulmonary issues that require special attention, and to establish a baseline for your health. It would be irresponsible of me to recommend a facility without this information. I understand your husband's concerns, but this is for your benefit. Would you prefer I discuss the results with him directly?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Maybe you could talk to my husband? He worries so much. He gets… upset easily. He wants me to be safe. I just want to be comfortable. And not cause trouble. If you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust you. But please… be gentle with him.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Abdollahi. I will explain the results to your husband in a clear and compassionate manner. I will also ensure he understands the potential implications and discuss the best course of action. Now, let’s arrange for these tests. I will have my nurse draw the blood samples before you leave, and we can schedule the chest X-ray at the imaging center across town. Do you have transportation arranged, or will you need assistance with scheduling that?
PATIENT: My husband drives. He will take me. He likes to be in control of things like that. He worries about me being alone. So, he does everything. He's a good man. So, he can schedule it. Is that okay? I don't want to cause any extra work. I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s perfectly acceptable. I’ll provide him with the necessary requisition forms and instructions. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Once the results are available—usually within 24 to 48 hours—we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and complete the medical assessment for the senior living facility. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you for being patient with me. And thank you for talking to my husband. I appreciate it very much. I think… I think that’s all. Is it alright if I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi. You may go now. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And I assure you, I will speak with your husband in a manner that minimizes any unnecessary anxiety. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
