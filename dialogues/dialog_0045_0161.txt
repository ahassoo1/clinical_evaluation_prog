DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Trefren. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Billman, it's… a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. A friend suggested I come in and ask about something to help prevent HIV. I don't want to get into all the details right now, but she said this clinic was… discreet, and you could explain things simply. Is that something you handle here?
DOCTOR: Preventative measures for HIV, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. She called it… PrEP, I think? Said it was a pill you take. Honestly, I don't really understand any of it. I just… I want to be safe, you know? And I’d like to know if it's even something I need to worry about, being my age. Is it common for… people like me? I don’t mean to be rude, but… I'm not exactly young anymore.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Trefren, HIV isn't exactly a young person’s disease anymore. Anyone who is sexually active can be at risk. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a medication, yes, and it can be effective. But it's not something you just… jump into. We need to assess your risk factors first. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Though… it's not regular, if that makes sense. And it's… complicated. I’ve been with the same person for a few years now, off and on. We don’t always… talk about these things, and I don’t want to upset him. I guess that’s why I came here alone. Does that… matter? And what does "assess my risk factors" even mean? Like a test? Will he find out?
DOCTOR: "Complicated" isn't a medical diagnosis, Mrs. Trefren. And frankly, avoiding communication with your partner about sexual health is… concerning. It always matters what your partner’s status is. "Assess risk factors" means I need to ask you some questions about your sexual history to determine if PrEP is even appropriate for you. It involves questions about the types of sexual activity you engage in, how often, and whether you use protection. And yes, there is a blood test required to see if you currently have HIV, and another to make sure you don’t have any underlying conditions that would make PrEP unsafe. Now, as for him finding out...that depends on how forthcoming you are with your medical information. HIPAA laws prevent me from disclosing anything without your explicit consent, but I can’t control what you tell others. Are you willing to answer some questions honestly, or is this a waste of both our time?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. It's just… a lot. And a little embarrassing. But you’re right, I need to be honest. I haven’t always been… careful. And he… well, he doesn’t like talking about things like this. Yes, I’ll answer your questions. I want to know if this is something I should be worried about, and if this pill can actually help. Just… maybe go slow? And please don’t judge me. This isn’t easy. What’s the first question?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with this: do you engage in receptive anal sex?
PATIENT: …Yes. Occasionally. It’s… part of our intimacy. But like I said, it’s not regular. And we never… we never talk about protection. I know, it’s stupid. I just… I didn’t want to bring it up. I was afraid of what he'd say. Does that make a difference? Is it… worse if it's that kind of act?
DOCTOR: Yes, it makes a difference, Mrs. Trefren. Receptive anal sex carries a significantly higher risk of HIV transmission than other forms of sexual activity. That's a scientific fact. The lining of the rectum is very delicate and easily damaged, providing a direct pathway for the virus to enter the bloodstream. Now, have either you or your partner ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. We… haven’t. He’s very private, and I didn’t want to push it. He gets… angry when I ask about things like that. I know, I know, it's terrible. I should have insisted. Is that… a bad sign? Should we both get tested now? What if… what if he has something? I'm starting to feel really sick about this.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Trefren, the fact that you haven't been tested, combined with unprotected receptive anal sex, significantly increases your risk. And frankly, your partner's reluctance to discuss this is… unacceptable. It’s irresponsible and frankly, selfish. Before we even consider PrEP, both of you need to be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hepatitis B and C. I can order those tests for you today. And I strongly advise you to have a frank and open conversation with your partner about safe sex practices. If he refuses to be tested or discuss this with you, then frankly, you need to reconsider the nature of your relationship. Your health is paramount. Do you understand?
PATIENT: …Yes. I understand. It’s just… hard. He’s a proud man, and he doesn’t like being told what to do. But you’re right. I… I need to protect myself. And I can’t keep pretending everything is okay. Yes, please order the tests. Both of them. And… could you maybe give me some… some ideas on how to talk to him? I’m afraid of what he'll say. I don't want to start a fight, but I also can't keep living like this. Is there anything else I should know right now, before I go talk to him? Maybe about what PrEP actually does, just so I can explain it properly?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's some information about PrEP. It's a daily pill that, when taken consistently, significantly reduces your risk of contracting HIV. It doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted infections, so regular testing is still crucial. As for talking to him… Look, I'm not a relationship counselor. But you need to be firm and direct. Explain that you're concerned about your health and that you need both of you to get tested. Frame it as a matter of mutual responsibility, not accusation. If he gets angry… Well, frankly, that says a lot about his character. Don’t let his pride jeopardize your wellbeing. I'm going to order these tests now. The lab results should be back in about a week. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to abstain from any sexual activity until both of you have been tested. And… I’m going to be blunt here… If he refuses to get tested, or if he’s unwilling to discuss safe sex, you seriously need to consider ending the relationship. Your health is more important. Do you have any other questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. It’s a lot to take in, but… thank you, Dr. Billman. For being honest, even if it wasn't easy to hear. I’ll try to talk to him. And… I'll schedule the tests right away. I… I think I’m ready to go now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab order will be sent electronically to the testing center. Have a… good day, Mrs. Trefren. .
