DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Really, must we go through all the pleasantries? I haven’t got all day. It’s…my skin. It’s darkened. And I tire easily. It's quite bothersome, frankly. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, that is sufficient. Thank you for sharing that. Darkened skin and fatigue… I understand it’s bothersome. Now, when did you first notice this darkening of your skin, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…difficult to say. Some time ago, certainly. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It all blurs together, you see. I work, I sleep, the days pass. I don't spend my time cataloging the precise moment my complexion changes. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, sir. Knowing when it started helps us understand what might be going on. Even a rough estimate is helpful. And was it a gradual change, or did it seem to happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. Though I wouldn't say "sudden" is entirely inaccurate either. Everything feels…slower these days. My memory isn’t what it once was. I simply noticed it was darker. Is there a quicker way to get to the point? I’ve always been a practical man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. We can get straight to it. Now, besides the darkened skin and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age, everything is changing! But…well, my appetite hasn’t been the best. And my wife says I’ve been…irritable. Though she’s always complaining about something. Don’t know what all the fuss is about, frankly. Is that what you mean? Other changes?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, that’s very helpful. Loss of appetite and irritability… alright. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I haven’t stepped on a scale in… decades. My wife handles those sorts of things. I assume if there was any significant change, she would mention it. She’s rather…focused on such matters. Really, Doctor, are you questioning my wife’s observations?
DOCTOR: No, sir, not at all. I simply want to get a complete picture. If you don’t know for certain, that's perfectly alright. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual aches and pains. A little sniffle here and there. Nothing worth mentioning. I’m a robust man, generally. I don't coddle myself over every minor discomfort. It’s probably just…old age catching up with me. Is this going anywhere, Doctor? Because I have a girder to inspect this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about your time, sir. Just a few more questions, and then we can proceed with a physical exam if you're agreeable. Now, are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no! I believe in a strong constitution and a good day’s work. I don’t rely on pills and potions. Supplements? Absolutely not. My wife tried to get me to take some…fish oil, I think it was. I put a stop to that nonsense right away. Pure codswallop, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And have you had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, I've lived eighty-five years. If I had any significant allergies, don’t you think I’d know by now? Dust, perhaps. A little hay fever in the spring. Nothing to write home about. Really, are we nearly done? This is quite tedious.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, sir. Just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have had any significant medical conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for goodness sake. That was… decades ago. My parents are long gone. Siblings too. Children… scattered across the globe, I believe. Honestly, I barely remember what they had for breakfast, let alone their medical ailments. It's all a blur. Look, I’m a practical man, Doctor. I build things, I don't dwell on the past. If you need details, you’ll have to ask my wife. Though I doubt she’ll remember either. Now, can we please move on? I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. I understand. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re willing. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your skin. It shouldn’t take long. Is that acceptable?
