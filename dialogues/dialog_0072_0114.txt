DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Medicare, and we're at the suburban clinic location. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. Medicare… and this clinic is fine. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets difficult. Like something is sitting on my chest. I want to get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: “Sorted quickly,” you say. We’ll do our best, Ms. Vanderwiele, but good medical care takes time and proper evaluation. Now, this difficulty breathing when lying flat… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. Time is… necessary, I suppose. It started… let me think. About three weeks ago, I believe. Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t bad at first, just noticed it. But it’s gotten worse each week. It keeps me up at night, mostly. I have to sleep propped up with pillows now.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, progressively worsening, requiring pillows for sleep… Alright. And is this difficulty breathing constant when you’re lying down, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… constant, yes. Once I lie flat, it starts. Not immediately, but within a few minutes. It doesn’t go away until I sit up. And it’s… a heavy feeling, not like I’m gasping for air, just… pressure. A lot of pressure. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It’s… descriptive, Ms. Vanderwiele. Now, do you experience any other symptoms with this pressure?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think carefully. Sometimes my ankles swell a little at the end of the day. Not terribly, but I notice it. And I get tired easily, even with a good night's sleep… when I can sleep, propped up, of course. And… occasionally, I feel a little fluttering in my chest. Like a bird, almost. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ankles swelling, fatigue, and… “fluttering.” Right. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any heart conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any heart trouble. I had a touch of arthritis in my hands when I was younger, but that’s all. And… the usual things, colds and flu, but nothing serious. I used to be very active, you know. Library work keeps you on your feet. But, as I said, no heart problems. I'd know if I had, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: One would assume so, Ms. Vanderwiele. However, symptoms can be… subtle. Let’s move on. Any family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. Towards the end of her life, anyway. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had a stroke, quite a bad one. I believe that was about twenty years ago. He didn’t recover very well. Does that help? It was a long time ago, I don't remember many details.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your mother, stroke in an uncle. Noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis, Doctor. A small white pill. I take one each morning. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a chamomile tea, but that’s all. Nothing else. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It never seems to fix anything, just adds to the problem.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea… very well. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Can I ask you to please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course, Doctor. The examination table. Fine. I hope it isn’t too… involved. I'm not very steady on my feet these days.
DOCTOR: It will be a standard examination, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your extremities. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Now, if you could lie flat, please. We’ll start with auscultation of your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Flat, you say? Very well, Doctor. But please, be gentle. This is… uncomfortable already. And quickly, if you don’t mind. I’d like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m listening to your heart now… and I do detect a slightly irregular rhythm. Not alarming, but certainly something to note. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished at the bases. And… yes, I do feel some pitting edema in both ankles. About plus one bilaterally. Now, please sit up slowly. We'll check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Irregular rhythm… and edema, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? It’s just… this breathing. I want to know what’s causing it. And what can be done about it. Quickly, please. My chest feels tighter just lying there.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Ms. Vanderwiele, 160/95. That, combined with the irregular rhythm, edema, and your reported symptoms… leads me to believe you are likely experiencing early signs of congestive heart failure. Now, I need to order some tests to confirm this diagnosis. An EKG, a chest x-ray, and a complete blood count. We'll also need to check your B-type natriuretic peptide, or BNP, level. This will give us a clearer picture of your heart function. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I… I don’t know. Never been told anything like that before. Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had any problems with… with anything like dye. But… this is a lot to take in. What does this mean? Will I… will I be alright? And quickly, please, Doctor. I’m feeling quite faint.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, please try to remain calm. “Congestive heart failure” simply means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, leading to fluid buildup in your body. The tests will help us determine the severity and guide our treatment plan. As for your feeling faint… that’s likely due to the elevated blood pressure and fluid retention. I’m ordering these tests now, and the lab should be able to accommodate you immediately. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-sodium diet and a mild diuretic to help reduce the fluid buildup. Do you have any questions before I send you to the lab?
PATIENT: A diuretic… and a low-sodium diet. It all sounds… restrictive. And frightening. Will I have to… change everything? What about my library work? I can’t just… stop. And… what if these tests show something very bad? Please, Doctor. Be honest with me. Is this… is this something I can recover from? Quickly, if you wouldn’t mind. I'm starting to feel very unwell.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, I understand your concerns, but catastrophizing will not help. Lifestyle adjustments are often necessary with congestive heart failure, but they are manageable. A low-sodium diet and a diuretic are standard treatments. As for your work… that is a matter for you to discuss with your employer. Regarding recovery… the prognosis varies depending on the severity of the condition and your response to treatment. The lab results will provide a clearer picture. I suggest you go there immediately, and then return here for a follow-up appointment next week. Do you need a referral to a cardiologist?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… Yes. Yes, please. A cardiologist. I suppose that’s… that’s what I need. Quickly, if you could. I’m feeling very weak. And… and could you perhaps explain to me… very simply… what these tests are? And what they will show? I just… I need to know what I’m facing.
DOCTOR: Very well. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, measures the electrical activity of your heart to detect any irregularities. The chest x-ray will show the size and shape of your heart and any fluid buildup in your lungs. And the blood tests, including the BNP level, will assess your heart function and rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. Here is the referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly-rated cardiologist. His office will schedule an appointment for you. Now, I have other patients waiting. Please go to the lab and schedule your appointments. If you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
