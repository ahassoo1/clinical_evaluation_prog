DOCTOR: Right. Carmaleta Villarreal, 43. Yes, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t really do small talk, Doctor... Osga, is it? I want to get pregnant. Simple as that. I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, I want a baby. Before it's too late, you understand? I don’t want any… complications. I want it to happen easily. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Easily. Right. Well, “easily” isn't a medical term, dear. A lot goes into it. You've been on your own for a few years… that can affect things. But let’s start with the basics. Have you been trying already?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, not really. I mean, I’ve… thought about it. But I figured I’d come before anything gets… difficult. You know? I just want to make sure everything is working properly. I’d rather not waste time, Doctor. Is that so much to ask? I have a good life, and I want to add to it, not… struggle.
DOCTOR: "Struggle". Everyone struggles at some point. Alright. So, no attempts at conception yet. Okay. Have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. It was always… later. We were building things. A house, a business… then… well. It wasn't meant to be. Look, I don’t want to rehash my life story. Does it matter if I haven’t had kids before? I just want to know what needs to be done to make it happen. Now.
DOCTOR: It does matter, yes. It gives us a baseline. First pregnancy is often… different. Alright. Let’s start with your medical history. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Nothing major. A few colds, the flu, you know, normal things. I had malaria when I was visiting family back home, years ago, but that was treated quickly. Honestly, I’m generally very healthy. I eat well, I try to stay active... I don't understand why we're going over all of this. Is this standard procedure? Because frankly, it feels a bit… invasive.
DOCTOR: It is standard, dear. And the malaria is relevant, so don’t dismiss it. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… No. Nothing significant. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was younger, but that was it. Really, Doctor, I'm a very straightforward case. Healthy woman, wants a baby. I don't want to be here all day listing every little thing. I'm sure you have other patients.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries. Good. Family history, then. Any issues with fertility on either side?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… Honestly? People don't really talk about that back home. It's… private. My mother had a lot of children, so I guess that's a good sign. My sister had some trouble conceiving, but she eventually had twins. Is that helpful? I don't even know where to begin with this. It feels like a waste of time. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing I'm aware of. I eat everything. I travel a lot, and I've never had a reaction to anything. I don't take any medications regularly, either. Are we getting anywhere with this? Or are we just going to list every possible ailment I don't have? I have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. It’s… necessary. I need to check your vitals, just to be sure. And yes, it's relevant. It's called due diligence, dear. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Oh. Now you want to actually do something? Fine. Just… be quick about it. I have things to do. And please, no unnecessary chatter. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Not bad. Pulse is… 72. Regular. Heart sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your weight is 130 pounds, height is 164 centimeters. BMI is within normal range. That’s… acceptable. Now, let's check a pelvic exam. It’s… routine.
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Now? Doctor, really? I thought we were just discussing basic health. Is this absolutely necessary? I'm not comfortable with that, frankly. I came here because I want a baby, not a… thorough examination. I thought we were establishing if there were any major issues. This feels like overkill. Are you sure there's not something else we can do first?
DOCTOR: "Overkill?
PATIENT: Look, I understand you're busy, but this is about my reproductive health! I'm a healthy woman, and I’m starting to feel like you’re treating me like… I don’t know. Like I’m broken! Are you implying something? I don’t appreciate that. If you can’t tell me what steps I need to take without a full-scale invasive examination, I’m going to find another doctor. I came here for a consultation, not a… performance. Honestly. Is there even a reason for all of this? Or are you just going through a checklist? I'm not a medical textbook!
DOCTOR: Fine. Look, I’m going to order some basic bloodwork. Hormone levels, complete blood count, rubella immunity… Things that will give us something to work with. It's not a checklist, it's called being thorough. And honestly, I'm merely trying to eliminate potential issues. If your levels are normal, then we can discuss next steps. But without that information, I’m working in the dark. I'll send the orders to the lab. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. And, if everything is clear, then we'll talk about timing intercourse and maybe a fertility specialist if things don’t progress. Now, is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… that’s… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have commitments, you know? And a specialist? I didn't come here for a specialist. I just want a simple solution. But, fine. Bloodwork. Get it done quickly, please. And I expect results promptly. Is that understood? I have a life to live, Doctor. Now, can I go? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Here. These are the tests. Go to the lab downstairs. They'll need your insurance information. They’ll contact you with the results, usually within a week. And yes, I understand you have a schedule. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I'll be in touch. And I expect a prompt response when the results are available. .
