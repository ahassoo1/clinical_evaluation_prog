DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Bahta, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Pitmon. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here because I need to… how you say… get permission, yes, for some help at home. My daughter thinks it is time. She is very concerned, you see. It is for… home health, I believe she said? And… hospice, perhaps. I am not entirely sure of the details.
DOCTOR: Hospice already?
PATIENT: Yes, that is what she mentioned. I understand it is… for when things are very serious. But I feel… quite alright, mostly. A little tired, perhaps, but nothing… drastic. My daughter, Marie, she worries easily. She is a good girl, but… a worrier. Perhaps it is best to discuss what she has arranged, and you can explain the difference, yes? I am not familiar with these… procedures.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s see… Mr. Bahta, according to your chart, you’re 54 years old… and your height and weight are… well, quite slight. 159 centimeters and 116 pounds. That’s… below average. Now, your daughter scheduled this appointment citing concerns about your overall condition and requesting information regarding home health and hospice. Before we get to that, let's establish what's going on with you. Tell me, in your own words, what’s been bothering you, if anything at all?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. My height and weight… I have always been small. My father was also a small man. But I am generally healthy. I am a surgeon, you see. Pediatric, mostly. Though I have slowed down considerably in the last few months. It is… tiring, the work. And my hands… they are not as steady as they once were. That is the main concern, I think. The hands. It makes certain procedures… difficult. I have had to ask colleagues to assist more frequently. I also find I sleep a great deal more than I used to. And… a little short of breath sometimes, when I walk up stairs. But nothing… debilitating, you understand. Just… slowing down. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Slowing down… right. A surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. For many years. I specialized in… correcting congenital heart defects in children. Very delicate work. Requires… precision. As I said, my hands… they tremble occasionally now. Not constantly, but enough to cause concern. And the fatigue… it comes and goes, but it is… persistent. It is difficult to explain. It is not simply being tired after a long day. It is… a weariness that lingers. My daughter believes it might be something… more serious. I am willing to listen to your opinion, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did you first notice these tremors in your hands?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. Let me think… It began, I believe, approximately six months ago. At first, it was very subtle. I attributed it to… stress. A particularly difficult case, a young patient who… well, never mind. But it persisted, even after the stress had passed. I began to notice it during surgery, a slight unsteadiness when making precise incisions. I compensated, of course. But it was there. Perhaps… November, yes. Around November of last year. I dismissed it as… simply getting older. A surgeon’s hands… they are used constantly. Perhaps they simply need rest. But it has… worsened gradually since then.
DOCTOR: And is this tremor constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is not constant, no. It is… intermittent. It seems to be worse when I am… stressed, or fatigued. And… when I attempt very precise movements. Like threading a needle, or making a very small incision during surgery. When I am relaxed, or simply holding something, it is less noticeable. Sometimes… it disappears entirely for hours at a time. But then it returns, without warning. It is… unpredictable, you see. I find it… disconcerting. I have always prided myself on my steady hands. It is… essential for my profession.
DOCTOR: Alright. Extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here. Is that… satisfactory? It is a little… difficult. My hands… they feel rather unsteady at the moment. Perhaps it is the examination itself. I am not accustomed to being… examined. I am usually the one doing the examining, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes. It's… noticeable, Mr. Bahta. And it seems to be more pronounced on your right hand. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here. Is that… correct? I felt… a slight tingling sensation, but nothing… painful. It is rather strange, being… tested. I am usually the one doing the tapping, you see. I am a surgeon, as I mentioned. Examining patients is… second nature to me. But being examined… it is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me. And another one. Now, can you tell me if you’ve experienced any dizziness, weakness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here. I have… occasionally experienced a slight… lightheadedness, particularly when I stand up quickly. It passes quickly, usually within a few seconds. Nothing… debilitating, you understand. And… a slight blurring of vision at times, but nothing significant. I attributed it to… fatigue, and perhaps the stress of my work. I have not consulted a doctor about it, as it was… intermittent, and not particularly bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. Thank you for that information. Now, I want to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always been… remarkably healthy, all my life. I have never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. I do not take any medication, and I have never been hospitalized for anything serious. A few minor ailments, of course – the occasional cold, a bout of the flu – but nothing… chronic. My family has a history of… longevity, mostly. My father lived to be eighty-nine years old, and my mother to eighty-seven. They both… remained active and healthy well into their old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. As a surgeon myself, I have… performed countless surgeries, but I have never had a surgery. A few minor procedures, of course – vaccinations, a tonsillectomy when I was a child – but nothing… major. I have always taken… excellent care of my health. And… avoided unnecessary medical interventions. I believe in… prevention, mostly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, based on what you've told me – the tremors in your hands, the fatigue, the slight lightheadedness, and the blurring of vision – and considering your medical history, I’d like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. I also want you to see a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly acceptable. If that is your recommendation, then I trust your judgment. Blood tests and an MRI… and a neurologist, yes. I understand it is… prudent to investigate these symptoms further. It is… unsettling, to feel one’s body… changing. I have always been so… strong, so capable. To feel… vulnerable, is… disconcerting. But if these tests will help to determine the cause, then I am willing to undergo them. Please… let me know what is required. And… where I should go.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the requisitions for the blood tests. You can get those done at the lab just down the hall, Room 203. And here’s a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a very good neurologist. Her office is located at 14 Oak Street. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. It may take a few days to get in. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially surgery. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very helpful. Room 203, and Dr. Reed at 14 Oak Street. I have made a note of that. No strenuous activity… yes, that seems… prudent. Yes… I do have one question, if you do not mind. You mentioned… ruling out underlying causes. Are you… concerned about something specific? Is there… anything I should be particularly worried about? I understand you do not want to alarm me, but… a little clarity would be… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, I want to be honest with you. Your symptoms – the tremors, the fatigue, the changes in vision – could be indicative of several different conditions. Some are benign, and easily treatable. Others… require more serious attention. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. However, we need to rule out conditions such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and… other neurological disorders. That’s why the neurological evaluation is so important. It’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have all the information. But, yes, there is the possibility of something more serious. I want to be upfront with you so you’re prepared. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s disease… essential tremor… yes. I… understand. It is… unsettling to hear those names. I have… read about them, of course. But to think… that they might apply to me… So… the tests will help to determine… which, if any, of those conditions I might have. And… to what extent. Yes. I… appreciate your honesty, Doctor. It is… better to know, even if the news is… unwelcome. I will… schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed as soon as possible. And… I will avoid any strenuous activity. Thank you. Is there… anything else I should be aware of? Any symptoms to watch out for? Anything I can do… to prepare?
DOCTOR: For now, just focus on resting and avoiding stress. Pay attention to any other symptoms that develop – any changes in your speech, difficulty with balance, or any new cognitive issues. If you notice anything significant, contact Dr. Reed’s office immediately. We'll discuss everything in detail once we have the results of the tests. It’s important to remember that a diagnosis doesn’t define you, Mr. Bahta. And even if you do receive a diagnosis, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Do you have any family members or friends who could accompany you to your appointments?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very reassuring. I will… pay close attention to any new symptoms, and I will contact Dr. Reed’s office immediately if I notice anything. My daughter, Marie, she would be… very willing to accompany me to my appointments. She is… quite insistent, actually. She worries easily, as I mentioned. But… I appreciate her concern. She would… be a good source of support. I believe… that is all for now. Thank you for your time, Doctor Pitmon. And… for your honesty. I will… schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed immediately. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bahta. I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we'll work through this together. .
