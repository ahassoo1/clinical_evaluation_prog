DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really, really bad lately. Worse than usual. I got cancer, you know? And the back pain... it’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely reasonable that you’re concerned about back pain, especially with a history of cancer. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of this. When you say “lately,” how long has this increased pain been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? It was just a little ache at first, you know? I thought it was just from working. But then it got worse, and worse, and now… it hurts to even sit up.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, starting as a little ache and progressing to pain that interferes with sitting up. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Okay… um… it's not like a sharp pain, exactly. It's more… a heavy ache. And it goes down my back, both sides. Sometimes it feels like… pins and needles, too, in my legs. It's hard to explain. It just… hurts. A lot. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Meigs. A heavy ache radiating down both sides of your back, with some tingling or “pins and needles” in your legs. That gives me a clearer picture. Does anything make the pain better?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes, when I lie flat on my back, it feels a little bit better. But not much. And when I'm busy, working… I forget about it for a little while, then it comes back worse. Does that make sense? Like, being busy helps me not think about it, but it doesn’t actually help the pain.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. Sometimes distraction can temporarily mask the discomfort. Now, can you tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: Oh! I work at the cannery. I sort the fish. It’s… a lot of bending and reaching, and standing for long hours. It’s good work, but it’s hard on my body, you know? Especially now. I try to be careful, but… it's hard when you gotta keep up.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds physically demanding, and with your history, it's important we consider how that might be contributing. Now, I'd like to ask a bit more about your cancer diagnosis, if you're comfortable sharing. What type of cancer was it, and what treatment did you receive?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… it was… lung cancer. They found it about two years ago. I had… chemotherapy, and then radiation. It went into remission, the doctor said. But… I worry it's come back. That’s why I’m so worried about the back pain.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history. Back pain can be a sign of cancer recurrence, although it has many other possible causes as well. To help determine the cause of your pain, I’d like to perform a physical exam. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and look for any tenderness or other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s okay. I want to know what’s going on. I just… Will it hurt? I’m scared it’s something bad. I don’t want to go through all that treatment again.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Meigs. We’ll be as gentle as possible during the exam. It shouldn’t be intensely painful, but you may feel some discomfort as we move and assess your back. We're simply gathering information at this stage to help us determine the best course of action. I’ll explain everything I'm doing as I go. First, could you please lie face down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I can do that. It’s a little hard to move, you know? But… I’m ready. Just… please be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I’m going to start by feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Please let me know immediately if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes… right there. That’s… that’s sore. And… a little bit to the left. It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. I’d like you to try and gently bend forward, backward, and to each side, as comfortable as you can. Just let me know if anything causes significant pain. Okay, can you try bending forward now?
PATIENT: Oof! That’s… hard. It hurts a lot in my lower back. I can’t go much further. It feels like something is… stuck. I don’t think I can bend very far, Doctor. It just… hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Meigs. No need to push yourself. That limited range of motion is significant. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished in both legs, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check sensation in your legs and feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It’s… a little bit numb, though. Not completely gone, but… not like it used to be. And… when you touch my feet, it feels… prickly. Like pins and needles. Like when my legs tingle, but… in my feet. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. The diminished sensation and prickling sensation are concerning and need further investigation. Based on the exam findings – the tenderness in your lower back, limited range of motion, diminished reflexes, and altered sensation in your legs and feet – it appears we need to rule out nerve compression or involvement. Given your history of lung cancer, it's important to be thorough. I recommend we order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will help us visualize the nerves and spinal cord and identify any potential causes of your pain. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that’s… that’s okay. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes. Will it hurt? And… how long does it take? I don't like being in small spaces, you know.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Meigs. Many people feel anxious in enclosed spaces. An MRI is generally a safe and painless procedure. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped magnet. It can be a little loud, so we’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones. The procedure typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. We can discuss options to help with any anxiety you might experience, such as a mild sedative. The radiology technician will be with you throughout the entire process and can communicate with you if needed. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation after we have the MRI results. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. A pain reliever would be good. And talking to a neurologist… that sounds smart. A sedative… maybe. I’ll think about it. Thank you, Doctor. I’m glad we’re figuring things out. It was scary just… not knowing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your fear, and I'm glad we're able to move forward with a plan. I'll have the nurse draw up the prescription for the pain reliever now, and we’ll get the referral to the neurologist sent over. I want to emphasize that we're not jumping to any conclusions at this point. The MRI is simply a tool to help us gather more information. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. You explained everything really well. Just… thank you. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as I can. And I’ll try to take it easy in the meantime.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns that arise before your MRI appointment. I’ll see you again after we have the results to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, focus on taking care of yourself. Have a good day, Ms. Meigs.
