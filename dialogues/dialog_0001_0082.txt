DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh... travel. I need... shots for travel. My wife... she wanted to go. Before... before things happened. Somewhere warm. I don't really remember where now. It was her dream.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Shots for travel.” Right. And when were you planning to travel?
PATIENT: Soon... I think. Before... September? Maybe October? She was making plans...booking things. I stopped after... well. I don't know the dates. It's all a bit... fuzzy. Is that okay? I don't keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. Tayar. Knowing when you were intending to travel is rather important for determining what vaccinations you might need. Was it within the last six months?
PATIENT: Six months...? Hmm. No. Not six months. Longer. Much longer. Maybe… eight months? Nine? She started looking at places... around November, December last year? Before... everything. I just want to... get this done, you know? So I can... move on. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright. Nine months ago, then. And where… roughly… was your wife looking?
PATIENT: Somewhere hot. Islands, I think. Lots of beaches. She showed me pictures… palm trees, blue water… I don't know the names of places, okay? I work with planes, not maps. Maybe… the Pacific? She liked the look of those… the ones with little huts over the water. Are those… safe? Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Islands in the Pacific… Honestly, that narrows it down very little. Look, Mr. Tayar, I understand you’re…distracted. But I need some information to provide appropriate medical care. Do you have any idea what specific islands or countries she was considering?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, okay. She kept saying… Fiji? And… Bali? Was that one? She liked the look of the hotels. Big pools, everything fancy. I remember her talking about… monkeys? In Bali? She wanted to see monkeys. Is that...helpful? I don't know why she needed to see monkeys. It seemed silly.
DOCTOR: Fiji and Bali... Alright. And have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? I… I think so. When I was a kid, maybe? Like, when I was little. For… school? I don't keep a record of these things. My wife… she always took care of that stuff. I just… fixed things. Planes. She handled the… doctor visits. I haven't really been to a doctor in… a long time. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Let me check your record…Hmm. Limited information here. Okay, Mr. Tayar, to be safe, given the timeframe and your destinations, we’ll need to review a few things. Have you ever had a hepatitis A or typhoid vaccination?
PATIENT: Hepa… what? And… tie-foid? No. Those don’t… ring a bell. Honestly, this is a lot. I just need the shots so I can… finish things. Are these… important? Can't we just… give me everything? Whatever people get when they go to… hot places? I don't want to spend all day here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, giving you “everything” is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. Vaccinations have side effects. We need to determine what you actually need based on your travel plans and medical history—or lack thereof. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. Not that I know of. I eat… rice. And noodles. And sometimes chicken. My wife made me try fancy things, sometimes, but I didn't really like them. I never had a… reaction to anything. I'm pretty tough. I work with metal all day! Is that… good enough? Can we just… skip the questions and get the shots? It's making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tayar, I understand you’re upset, but I need a straight answer. Have you ever had a reaction to a medication or vaccine?
PATIENT: No! Okay? No reactions. Ever. I told you. I don’t… get sick easily. Metal shavings, burns, loud noises… I deal with it. I’m a strong guy. Can we please just… do this? I have… things to take care of. And honestly, I don’t like talking about this. It’s… personal.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, limited vaccine history. Given your destinations—Fiji and Bali—and the timeframe, I recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations. We should also consider a Tetanus booster, if you haven't had one in the last ten years. Let's get started with those. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Just… be quick, okay? I don’t like needles. And don’t ask me any more questions. Please.
DOCTOR: This may sting. Try to relax. Hepatitis A. Now, the Typhoid. Same thing. There. Two down. Now, do you recall when you last had a Tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Ugh. That stung. A lot. Te… what? Tetanus? No. I don’t… remember. Never. Probably never. Look, can I just… sit down? My arm is aching. And I'm getting a headache. Are you sure I need all these things? I just want to… go.
DOCTOR: Okay, fine. We'll proceed with a Tetanus booster as well. Given your lack of recall, it's the safest course of action. This is the last one, Mr. Tayar. Try to stay still. Alright, that's everything. Keep the bandage on for at least an hour and monitor for any severe reactions. There's some information about potential side effects. If you experience anything concerning, contact your primary care physician. I’m documenting these vaccinations in your record. Do you have any other medical concerns that you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: No! No other concerns. Just… done. I’m done. Thank you. I need to go now. Please, don't call me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tayar. Have a… day.
