DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Bacy. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… well, just finding a little more peace, I suppose. I was hoping to talk about mindfulness or meditation, if that’s something you can help with. I’ve heard good things, but honestly, I don’t really know where to start.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful goal, Ms. Sugino. It’s great you’re taking steps to prioritize your well-being. While I don’t specialize specifically in mindfulness training, we can definitely explore if there are underlying factors contributing to your feelings, and I can offer some resources. To start, could you tell me a little more about what's been making you feel this need for more peace?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know! I wasn’t sure if this was the right sort of doctor’s visit, to be honest. Well, my job… it’s not bad, exactly. I repair signals and track switches for the railway. It’s important work, keeps everything running smoothly. But it’s… focused. Very focused. And sometimes, after a long day, my mind just races. It’s hard to switch off, you know? And I find myself getting… irritable, sometimes. Not with anyone in particular, just… generally. It’s been happening more lately, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite stressful, Ms. Sugino – a job requiring intense concentration can definitely lead to mental fatigue and irritability. It’s good you’re recognizing this pattern. So, this racing mind and irritability… how long has this been going on, and would you say it's been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I’d say it’s been… maybe six months, at least. And yes, definitely gradual. It didn’t just appear one day. It started with just a little bit of trouble sleeping, and then I started noticing myself getting annoyed more easily. Small things, really. Like, if someone was talking too loudly, or… well, just generally being a bit more on edge. It's not constant, but it happens often enough to bother me. And then the racing thoughts started, especially at night. It’s hard to explain, it's just… a lot of “what ifs” and replaying things that happened during the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradually worsening sleep disturbance, increased irritability, and racing thoughts, particularly at night. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any other changes alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I suppose… my appetite hasn’t been the best. Not that I’ve lost weight or anything, but I don’t really feel hungry as often as I used to. And I’ve been a little more… withdrawn, maybe? I used to enjoy going out with friends, but lately I’ve been making excuses. Just… not feeling up to it, I guess. It’s not sadness, exactly, just… a lack of energy. And a little bit of… anxiety, I suppose, about things. Though again, it’s not overwhelming. It's more like a low-level hum in the background. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. Decreased appetite, social withdrawal, and a low-level of anxiety alongside the sleep issues, irritability, and racing thoughts. It sounds like you’re experiencing a constellation of symptoms that could be related to stress and potentially anxiety. Before we go further, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture. Do you have any past medical history – any chronic illnesses or significant injuries?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no major injuries. I see a dentist regularly, of course, and had a flu shot last year. That's about it. Oh, and my mother had high blood pressure, if that’s relevant. But I don’t have any of those symptoms. I get my blood pressure checked at the dentist, and it's always been fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant medical history, just childhood illnesses and a family history of high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been very lucky, I think. I've managed to avoid needing any surgeries so far. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't take any prescription medications. Occasionally I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. And I don't really take any vitamins or supplements regularly. Just… if I’m feeling a bit run down, maybe some vitamin C during the winter, but that’s about it. It's very infrequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, as they say. No reactions, no problems. Nothing at all. I don’t even have seasonal allergies, which is surprising, living in the city.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Well, I’m single. Never married, never had children. Not by choice, exactly, just… things didn’t work out that way. I have a few friends, mostly from work, but we don’t see each other very often. I keep in touch with my sister, she lives in Plovdiv, in Bulgaria. We talk on the phone every few weeks. And I have a cat, called Mishka. He’s very good company. Otherwise… I wouldn’t say I have a very active social life. I like my own company, to be honest. Does that answer your question? It’s not very exciting, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Sugino. It’s important to me to understand the whole picture, and that gives me a good sense of your life. Now, let's talk a little bit about your work. You mentioned it's very focused. Can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, absolutely. Well, I usually start with a briefing from the control center. They tell us about any issues on the tracks, or scheduled maintenance. Then I’m assigned a section to inspect, usually with another colleague. We travel by rail car along the tracks, looking for any damage – broken rails, faulty switches, problems with the signaling system. It requires a lot of concentration, because even a small issue can cause a big problem. We have to be very thorough. It's a lot of walking, a lot of bending and crouching, and a lot of looking at small details. And it can be quite physically demanding, especially in the summer heat. We're outside all day, whatever the weather. And it's a responsible job, because people are relying on us to keep the trains running safely. After the inspection, we report any issues and schedule repairs. It's… repetitive, in a way, but important. And it requires a lot of mental focus. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. It sounds like a very demanding job, both physically and mentally. And it's understandable that that level of responsibility and concentration could contribute to stress. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I don't mind at all. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so it's probably a good idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sugino. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80 – slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point, given your stress levels. Throat and ears look normal. No visible signs of infection or inflammation. Your weight is 136 pounds, and your height is 161 centimeters, which puts your BMI at 26.3, placing you in the overweight category, but not drastically so. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, it seems likely that your symptoms are related to stress and potentially some anxiety, possibly exacerbated by the demands of your job. It's good that you don't have any other underlying medical conditions contributing to this. We can discuss several options, including lifestyle changes, stress management techniques, and if needed, explore medication options. Would you like to discuss these options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I’d really appreciate that. I'm not keen on taking medication if I can avoid it, to be honest, so lifestyle changes and stress management techniques sound good to me. What sort of things are we talking about? And… are there any specific resources you’d recommend? I don't really know where to start, as I said.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely start with lifestyle changes and stress management techniques. In terms of lifestyle, regular exercise can be incredibly helpful – even a 30-minute walk a few times a week can make a difference. Focusing on a healthy diet is also important, and limiting caffeine and alcohol intake. For stress management, techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, and mindfulness can be very effective. There are also resources available to help you learn these techniques. I recommend the website Mindful.org – they have a lot of free guided meditations and articles on mindfulness. Another resource is the Calm app, which offers guided meditations and sleep stories. We can also discuss Cognitive Behavioral Therapy . CBT is a type of therapy that can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. It's very effective for anxiety and stress. I can give you a referral to a qualified therapist if you're interested. Finally, have you considered taking any time off work to de-stress and recharge?
PATIENT: That’s all very helpful, thank you. I will definitely look into Mindful.org and the Calm app. CBT sounds… a bit daunting, to be honest, but I'm willing to consider it if it might help. I haven’t thought about taking time off work yet, but… maybe that’s something I should look into. It’s just… I don’t want to leave my colleagues short-handed. But I suppose my health is important too. What’s your opinion on the vitamin C? I was taking it during the winter, hoping to ward off colds, but I wasn't sure if it had any effect on my stress levels.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid point about your colleagues, Ms. Sugino. We can discuss strategies to minimize disruption if you decide to take some time off. Regarding the vitamin C, there's no strong evidence to suggest it directly reduces stress levels. It’s a good antioxidant and can boost your immune system, which is helpful in general, but it's unlikely to have a significant impact on your racing thoughts or irritability. It’s fine to continue taking it if you find it reassuring, but I wouldn’t rely on it as a primary stress management tool. For now, let’s focus on incorporating some of these lifestyle changes and stress management techniques into your routine. I suggest starting with the guided meditations on Mindful.org and trying to get at least 30 minutes of exercise a few times a week. I'd like to see you back in a month to see how you're doing. We can discuss your progress and adjust the plan as needed. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that all sounds very good. A month sounds like a reasonable timeframe. Thank you, Dr. Bacy. You've been very helpful. I feel a bit more hopeful now, knowing there are things I can do. I will definitely look into the website and try to incorporate those changes into my routine. I think that’s all for now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad I could help. Remember, taking care of your well-being is important. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again in a month.
