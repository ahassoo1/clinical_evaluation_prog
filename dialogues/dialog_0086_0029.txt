DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Norval, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, Norval. Just Norval is fine. And you can call me Norval, please. It's a bit formal otherwise, eh?
DOCTOR: If you insist, Norval. Though, frankly, I prefer to maintain a professional distance. Now, you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this…feeling full, really quick. I don’t eat much these days anyway, being my age and all, but even a little bit of food…bam. Like someone put a brick in my stomach. It's been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month. It's just…not right.
DOCTOR: "Fullness quickly, even with small amounts of food…for a month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to keep track exactly, you know? Days kinda blend together when you're older. It's not painful, not exactly. Just…uncomfortable. And it makes me not want to eat anything, which can't be good, can it? I used to enjoy a good piece of salmon...now, even thinking about it doesn't sound appealing.
DOCTOR: So, no pain, just…discomfort and a lack of appetite. And this started around a month ago. Have you noticed any other changes, Norval?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I have been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. Not like, sick tired, just…everything feels like a bit more effort. Getting up and about, that sort of thing. And…oh! My daughter, Sarah, says I've been quieter. She says I don't tell as many stories. Which is…well, I like telling stories, you know? It's how we Haida people do things. Sharing our history. I don’t know if that’s connected though.
DOCTOR: Increased fatigue, decreased activity level…and your daughter notes a change in your social engagement. Alright. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or any changes in your bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. Thankfully. And…bowel habits…well, they're…regular enough, I guess. Not much to have, if you know what I mean. Smaller portions, smaller results. Constipation isn't really the problem, if that makes sense. Just…less of everything. I haven’t really thought much about it until now, to be honest. It all just feels…connected to this full feeling. It's like, my body just doesn’t want food.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before this started, about a month ago, were you eating normally?
PATIENT: Pretty normal, yeah. Not a huge eater, never have been, but I ate. A bit of salmon, some rice, maybe some vegetables if Sarah brought them over. Nothing fancy. Just…enough to keep me going. I haven’t changed anything in my diet, not that I recall. Sarah would know better, she's the one who worries about all that healthy stuff. But I haven’t started eating anything new or different, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Now, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see...nothing major, really. Old age is the biggest condition I got, I reckon. I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with a…a little tube, I think. A stent, Sarah called it. That was about five years ago, and I've been alright since. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of getting old. No cancer, no diabetes, nothing like that. I haven’t been to the doctor much, truth be told. I prefer to just…get on with things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A stent placed five years ago for heart trouble. Alright. And have you had any surgeries other than the stent placement?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Just the stent. I broke my wrist when I was a boy, falling out of a tree, but that was a long time ago. They set it and I was good as new. Nothing since then. Mostly just…bumps and bruises. Old age does that to ya, you know? Everything feels more fragile.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Norval?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure. Sarah makes sure I take it every morning. A small white one. And…sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take one of those over-the-counter pain relievers. The kind you get at the drugstore. Ibuprofen, I think. But that's it. Mostly, I just try to manage on my own.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Sarah always asks, and I always say no. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, being Haida and all. We eat a lot of seafood, berries, things like that. Nothing’s ever bothered me. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Don't have much in the way of fancy sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just…try to be gentle, eh? Old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are…regular, but a bit faint. Some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs, likely from age. Now, your abdomen. Is this tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Feels…normal, I suppose. A little soft, maybe, but not sore. It doesn't hurt when you press, just…feels empty, if that makes sense. Like there's not much in there. Ooh, that's a bit sensitive there, on the left side. Not painful, just…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your lymph nodes…a few slightly enlarged nodes in your left axilla, but not significantly concerning at this point. Pulses are a bit weak, but present in all extremities. Some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The fullness you're experiencing, coupled with the loss of appetite and fatigue…it could be a number of things.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. What sort of things? I don’t want to bother you too much, Doctor. I’m just an old man, after all.
DOCTOR: It could be something as simple as reduced gastric motility, common with age. However, given your weight loss and fatigue, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. Specifically, we need to consider the possibility of gastrointestinal issues…perhaps a blockage, or even something like early-stage cancer. It’s unlikely, but we can’t dismiss it. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and liver function tests. I also want to schedule a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh…cancer? That sounds…frightening. A CT scan…is that painful? And the blood work, will it take much? I don't like needles much, to be honest. I just…I hope it's nothing serious. I trust you, Doctor, but it’s hard to hear things like that. What if it is something bad? What then?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, please, try not to panic. I said it could be something serious. It’s far more likely to be something less concerning. But we need to investigate to be certain. The CT scan is painless, it’s like a more detailed X-ray. You'll lie on a table for a few minutes while the machine takes pictures. The blood work will just take a few minutes to draw, a little prick. And we will discuss the results as soon as they are available. If there is something concerning, we will discuss all of your options for treatment, including referrals to specialists if necessary. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I will be with you every step of the way. We will take things one step at a time. Do you have any family or friends who can support you through this process?
PATIENT: My daughter, Sarah. She worries about me a lot. She's a good girl. She could come with me for the CT scan, if that's alright. And for the results, too. I get a bit…confused sometimes, with all the medical talk. She’s better at understanding things. I hope it's nothing, though. I just want to spend my days sharing stories, you know? Not…being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Having Sarah with you is a very sensible idea. She can help with understanding the results and making decisions. I'll have my staff schedule the CT scan for you and Sarah. They'll also give you the lab requisition form for the blood work. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist as a precaution. We can schedule a consultation with them once we have the results of the tests. It doesn't mean you definitely need to see them, but it's best to be prepared. I also want to emphasize the importance of staying hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids over the next few days, even if you don’t feel particularly thirsty. Here’s the referral information, and a list of instructions for the CT scan and blood work. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. And…thank you for not dismissing me. Some doctors don't listen to old people, you know. They just assume it's part of getting old. I’ll make sure Sarah calls to schedule everything. And I’ll try to drink more water. It’s hard sometimes, when you don't feel like it. But I will try. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get in touch with my office if you have any concerns before your appointments. I expect to hear from Sarah soon. Take care, Mr. Obarr. .
