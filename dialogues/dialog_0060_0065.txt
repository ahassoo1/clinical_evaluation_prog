DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine, and yet… here we are.
DOCTOR: Hm. Gaining weight with no changes to diet or exercise… right. It is unsettling. Okay. Let’s try to get a little more specific. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately six months, I’d say. Perhaps a little longer. It started gradually, but now… now it’s quite noticeable. I stepped on the scale just this morning and… well, that’s why I’m here. It’s rather a lot of weight, for no apparent reason.
DOCTOR: Six months… and how much weight would you estimate you’ve gained during that time, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven't been precise, you understand. But… I’d say approximately 15 kilograms. Perhaps a little more. It’s… it’s enough to make my clothes feel quite tight. And I feel… sluggish, if that makes sense. Not ill, exactly, just… heavier.
DOCTOR: Fifteen kilograms… alright. And you’ve truly not made any changes to your diet at all?
PATIENT: Absolutely none, Doctor. I still prepare the same meals, the same portions. My husband and I eat the same things, and he hasn’t gained an ounce. I still walk to the market most days, and I help with the gardening. It's very perplexing. I do enjoy a small biscuit with my tea in the afternoon, but I’ve been doing that for years.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Selbitschka, sometimes weight gain can be caused by… well, a lot of things. Before we jump to conclusions, let's go through a quick review of your general health. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Hmm. I’ve been… a little more tired than usual, yes. And my ankles seem to swell a bit at the end of the day, but I assumed it was the heat. We’ve had a rather warm summer. I haven’t felt unwell, not a fever or anything like that. Just… tired and puffy. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Selbitschka, that is relevant. Tiredness and ankle swelling… okay. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. My parents were both very healthy, and I’ve always considered myself to be in reasonably good health. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing serious. I haven't needed to see a doctor regularly for anything… until now, I suppose. I do get my annual check-up with Dr. Jankauskas, but he always says I'm "robust." It's rather embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Robust,” you say. Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had…arthritis, I believe. Nothing with her heart. My father… he lived a long life, but he did have high cholesterol, towards the end. That’s about all I know, honestly. My family wasn't one for discussing ailments. It was considered… impolite, I suppose. Does that information help, Doctor? It’s not much, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, as Dr. Jankauskas recommended, but that’s the extent of it. And I have no known allergies. No reactions to food, plants, or anything like that. I'm rather fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just… I do hope you can find something. It's unsettling not knowing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just step on the scale for me, please. And then we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I do apologize for the… inconvenience. It’s not easy, explaining this to everyone. Hopefully, you can shed some light on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Blood pressure is a little high today, 148 over 92. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear, but I detect a slight… murmur. Not alarming, but worth noting. Now, I’d like to feel your abdomen and check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A murmur, you say? That doesn’t sound… pleasant. Is that serious, Doctor? I do try to remain calm, but this is all rather worrying. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: The murmur is mild, Ms. Selbitschka. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it’s something we need to investigate further. The tenderness in your abdomen is also worth noting. Now, I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test. Just to rule out any underlying issues. We’ll check your thyroid function, kidney and liver function, and glucose levels.
PATIENT: Blood work and a urine test… yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever is necessary. It’s just… I’ve never been one for medical tests. My husband always handles these things. He’s rather practical. But… if that’s what you recommend, then I’ll do it. Will they need a large sample, Doctor? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do dislike being hungry.
DOCTOR: We’ll take a standard blood sample, Ms. Selbitschka, nothing too extensive. And yes, for the most accurate glucose levels, I would recommend fasting for at least eight hours beforehand. However, given your discomfort, we can proceed without fasting, and I’ll make a note of that on the requisition. It might just mean we need to repeat the test if the results are borderline. As for the urine sample, you’ll just need to collect a mid-stream sample when you can. I'll have the nurse provide you with a container and instructions. We’ll also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm, given the murmur.
PATIENT: An EKG… That sounds… complicated. Is that painful, Doctor? I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have… commitments later this afternoon. My garden needs tending, and I promised my husband I’d bake him his favorite apple cake. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose I can reschedule. I just… I do dislike being a bother.
DOCTOR: The EKG is not painful at all, Ms. Selbitschka. It's a quick and simple procedure. We’ll just attach some small electrodes to your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. I understand you have commitments, and we'll do our best to keep things moving as quickly as possible. It’s important we get a comprehensive picture of your health, and the EKG will help us do that. We’ll get everything done as efficiently as possible, and then you can get back to your garden and your apple cake.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You are quite right, of course. It is important to be thorough. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. Just… perhaps you could let me know when you are finished with each test, so I know what to expect? I do dislike surprises. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary restrictions, or exercises I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. I'll explain each test before we begin, and I’ll let you know when we’re finished with each one. For now, I wouldn't worry about any specific dietary restrictions or exercises. Just continue with your normal routine. However, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact me immediately. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Then we’ll do the EKG. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I do appreciate your patience. It's just… I’ve never been one for hospitals or medical procedures. My husband always takes care of these things. But… I’m glad I came in. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this soon. Please, let me know when the nurse is ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be right with you. In the meantime, try to relax. We'll take things one step at a time. .
