DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's this tingling. In my hands, mostly. And sometimes in my feet. It’s been going on… I don’t know, a few weeks now, maybe longer? It just comes and goes, you know? Not painful, exactly, just… weird. Like pins and needles. I just want to know what’s causing it, if that’s alright. I’ve got things to do, so if we can get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say… and intermittent. “Weird” isn’t a particularly helpful descriptor, Ms. Uzarski, but I understand you’re eager to get this resolved. Is it constant at any point?
PATIENT: No, not constant. Definitely not. It comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes I won’t notice it all day, then other times it's… more frequent. Usually when I’m resting, I think. Or maybe when it's cold? It's hard to say for sure. I've been trying to pay attention, but honestly, it just comes on without me thinking about it. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a relative term, Ms. Uzarski. Let’s try to be more specific. Does anything trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not that I've noticed, really. I do a lot of walking for my job – the mail route, you know? – and it doesn’t bother it any more than when I’m sitting. I tried to think… sometimes after I’ve been gardening, maybe? But I garden all the time, and it doesn’t always happen after. Honestly, I wish I knew! It's just… there. And then gone. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: So, gardening may exacerbate it. Do you experience any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not really. I can still do everything. I still carry the mail, I still bake my babka, I still… well, I still do everything. Maybe a little clumsy sometimes, but I always figured that was just getting old! It’s not like I’m dropping things all the time or anything. I can still grip things just fine. I suppose I get tired easier, but who doesn’t when they’re my age?
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not really. Maybe a little achy sometimes, in my joints. But again, who doesn’t at my age? I don’t have any dizziness, no trouble breathing, no headaches… nothing else that I can think of. I feel… okay, otherwise. Just this tingling. It’s just… unsettling, you know? It feels like something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Unsettling is… understandable. Do you have any history of diabetes, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, no. Never. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a bit of trouble with his blood pressure, but not diabetes. I’ve never been told I have any problems with my sugar levels. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, not too much sweets… although I do love my babka. But that’s just a treat. I’ve never had a test for diabetes, though, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please extend your arms. I'm going to test your reflexes and strength. And I’ll need to examine your feet as well. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here we go. Just let me get these off… It's a bit chilly in here, you know. Hope I don't catch a cold. It's always something, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… within normal limits, though slightly diminished. Strength is also adequate, but… not robust. I observe some mild pallor in your feet, and your skin feels slightly cool to the touch. Can you describe your typical diet in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet? Well, I try to eat good. For breakfast, usually oatmeal with some fruit. Sometimes toast. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe some soup. I make my own bread, you know? And for dinner… well, it varies. Chicken, potatoes, vegetables. I eat a lot of beets, my husband loved beets. I try not to eat too much red meat. And, like I said, I have my babka sometimes. It’s a Polish recipe, very good. Not every day, though! Maybe once a week. I drink a lot of tea, too. Herbal tea. Is that helpful? I’m not a fancy eater, Doctor. Just simple things.
DOCTOR: Simple is… not necessarily indicative of adequate nutrition, Ms. Uzarski. Based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary examination, I suspect this tingling may be related to peripheral neuropathy. It could be caused by a number of factors, including vitamin deficiencies, though we must rule out other possibilities. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We will also check your thyroid function.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests. Is that… serious? Peripheral… what did you call it? Will I need… medicine? I really don’t want to take a lot of pills, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing this tingling and get it fixed. Is that too much to ask? I have things to do, you know. The garden needs weeding… and I promised Mrs. Kowalski a loaf of babka.
DOCTOR: Neuropathy itself isn’t necessarily serious, Ms. Uzarski, but it can be a symptom of underlying conditions that are. The tests will help us determine the cause. And while medication may be necessary, it’s premature to discuss that at this stage. Let me review the results first. Here is the requisition form. Please take this to the lab. They are located down the hall to your left. Once the results are available, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, I guess not. Just… when should I expect to hear something? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting? Or… anything? I don’t want to just sit around waiting, you know. I just want this to be over with, Doctor. Really. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 3-5 business days. As for what you should be doing… avoid any activities that exacerbate the tingling, if possible. And maintain a healthy diet. I believe that is all. Please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any significant changes in your condition. .
