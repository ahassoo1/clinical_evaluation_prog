DOCTOR: Right. So, Ms. Purtee, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Batara. It's… it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've noticed a change in my body odor, and it's worrying me. It’s not… how do I put this? It just smells different than usual. I haven’t changed anything – same soap, same deodorant, same clothes. It just started a couple of weeks ago, maybe three.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap a pen against the chart, a slight frown creasing my forehead. A change in body odor… really?
PATIENT: Yes, really! I know it sounds silly, but I always smell… well, me, you know? And this isn’t it. It’s… sweeter, maybe? And a little stronger, even after I shower. My daughter – she mentioned it, actually, said I smelled “different”. She's usually very polite, so that’s why I came in. I didn’t want to ignore it.
DOCTOR: <stage>I sigh softly, making a note on the chart. "Sweeter," huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sweeter is the best way I can describe it. And it's not just after exercising or anything. It's… just all the time. It’s not a bad smell, exactly, but it's definitely not my normal scent. I’ve been trying to figure out what could be causing it, but I’m drawing a blank. I haven't started any new medications, and my diet hasn't changed. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Do you… have any idea what could cause that? It's just unnerving.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Purtee, sometimes these things happen. People’s bodies change. But a change in body odor can be a sign of something, though it’s rarely serious. Let’s get a bit more information, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, please. Anything would be helpful. I’m glad you’re taking it seriously. I just… I like knowing what’s going on with my body. Is there anything specific you need to know? Do you want to know about other symptoms? I haven’t noticed anything else, but I’m happy to tell you anything you ask.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any existing conditions?
PATIENT: Okay. Let’s see… I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for – Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. Oh, and arthritis in my knees, but it’s pretty mild. I manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them. Does that cover it? Should I mention any allergies? I’m not really allergic to anything I know of.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… Lisinopril… Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had heart problems later in life. My father… he had high cholesterol, I think. And my sister has asthma, but that’s about it. No history of anything… unusual, really. No cancers or anything like that, thankfully. Oh, and my grandmother on my mother’s side had… something with her thyroid, but I don’t remember the specifics. It was a long time ago, and no one talked about it much. Would knowing what she had be helpful? I’m not sure I remember enough details to be useful.
DOCTOR: Possibly. We can look that up later if necessary. Now, Ms. Purtee, let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. I mostly just drink water, really. I try to stay healthy. I walk most days, if the weather is nice, and I eat a lot of vegetables. I work as a floor layer, so it’s pretty physical work, but I try to take care of myself. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: And your weight has been stable?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. I weigh around 134 pounds, and I’ve been staying around that weight for years. Maybe a pound or two up or down depending on the time of year, but nothing significant. I haven't lost or gained a noticeable amount of weight recently. I can tell you exactly what it was last time I went to the dentist, if that helps – 136 on March 12th. I have a good memory for details like that. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Let’s move on to a physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Should I… change into a gown? Or is it okay to keep my clothes on for now? I just want to make sure I do everything correctly. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Yes, please change into a gown. It’ll make things easier. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your… general condition. Don’t worry too much. It’s probably nothing.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back. Hopefully, I can find the opening on this gown… They don't make these things easy, do they? .
DOCTOR:
