DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. I’m supposed to get some shots, you know, keep everything up to date. Routine stuff. My husband reminded me – he's good at that, keeping track of things I forget!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fornes. Preventative care is very important, and your husband sounds quite supportive. Before we proceed with any vaccinations, I'd like to get a more complete picture of your overall health. It's been a few years since your last documented visit, according to our records. Would you mind if we go through a brief medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds good. It has been a while, hasn’t it? I mostly just see a chiropractor for my back, honestly. Not much else goes on, thankfully. I can tell you what I remember… where do we start?
DOCTOR: Let's start with your current symptoms, if any. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual feelings at the moment?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. My back aches a little sometimes, like I said, but that’s just old age creeping up on me, I guess! It's nothing new. Otherwise, I feel pretty good, all things considered. I get tired easier than I used to, but that could just be the summer heat. It’s been a scorcher lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you mentioned the back pain is ongoing?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. It comes and goes, mostly when I've been doing a lot of work around the house. I do a bit of gardening, and some small repairs – I like to keep busy. It's not constant pain, just… a dull ache. The chiropractor helps, but it always seems to come back. It's not something that stops me from doing things, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And aside from the back pain and some fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. My eyesight's getting worse, I suppose, that’s why I have these glasses! And maybe I’ve been a little more forgetful lately, but I always blame that on getting older too. Honestly, I can't really pinpoint anything major. I eat okay, try to walk when I can, and generally try not to worry too much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Fornes. It's good that you're proactive about your health and aware of any changes. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I haven’t had anything serious in a long time, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a kid, of course. And when I was in my thirties, I had my tonsils out. Other than that… nothing much. No major surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was younger, falling off a horse. That was a long time ago, though. It healed up fine. Do you need to know about anything specific?
DOCTOR: No, that's a very good start, Ms. Fornes. It's helpful to know about all of those things. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father had some heart trouble. His side of the family, they always had a lot of problems with their hearts. And my grandmother… she had diabetes, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember all the details. Nobody really talked about it much when I was growing up. It wasn't something people shared easily, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Fornes. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about high blood pressure, heart trouble, and diabetes is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… alright. Well, I’ve been married to my husband, David, for… oh goodness, 32 years now! He’s a good man. We have two grown children, both married with kids of their own. I mostly stay at home, keeping busy with the house and the garden. I used to volunteer at the local school, but I haven't been doing that lately. And I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: That’s a lovely picture, Ms. Fornes. Thank you for sharing. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics before, and some pain relievers for headaches, but never anything serious. And I can eat pretty much anything. My husband jokes that I have an iron stomach! I've never had any trouble with bee stings or anything like that, either. Honestly, I think I’m pretty lucky in that department, too.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fornes. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. Just my usual vitamins, a multivitamin mostly. And sometimes I take some fish oil, for my joints. But that's it. No prescriptions, no special creams or anything like that. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fornes. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm not worried about it at all. I always figured I'd be getting poked and prodded, anyway, since I came in for shots! Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. There you go. I always get a little nervous when they take my blood pressure, but I guess that's normal, right?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 132 over 84. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. We can monitor it at your next visit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Good. Now, could you open your mouth wide and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go… Ahhhh. Is everything okay? My throat feels a little scratchy today, now that you mention it. Probably just the dry weather.
DOCTOR: Your throat is slightly red, and your tonsils are a little swollen, which could explain the scratchiness you’re feeling. No visible signs of infection, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears. Your ears look clear and healthy. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally well, Ms. Fornes. Given your age and history, and the slight elevation in your blood pressure, I recommend a few routine blood tests to screen for cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it'll give you a better picture of what's going on, I'm happy to get some blood tests. It’s always good to be thorough. Where will I go to get those done? And do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fornes. Yes, fasting is required for about 12 hours beforehand - meaning no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. You can drink water. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. The order will be sent electronically, so they’ll be expecting you. After the results come back, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. As for the shots you came in for, I recommend a Tdap booster and a flu shot. Would you like to get those today, or schedule them for another visit?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, no food after midnight. I can manage that! And yes, let’s just get the shots done today while I’m here. Get it over with, you know? I don't want to have to make another trip if I can avoid it. I’ve always hated needles, but I know they’re important. Which arm do you prefer?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Fornes. I completely understand. The left arm is usually preferred, as it doesn’t impact the blood pressure reading we just took. Please roll up your sleeve. The Tdap booster protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis , and the flu shot will help protect you against this year's influenza strains. There might be a little soreness at the injection site for a day or two, but it’s usually mild. Alright, that’s all done. I’ve applied bandages to the injection sites. Please keep them dry for the next few hours. You might experience some mild fatigue or muscle aches, which are normal reactions. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn’t so bad! A little pinch, that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don't think I have any questions. You explained everything so clearly. Just gotta avoid using that arm too much, I guess. Is there anything else I should be aware of? And should I be getting a flu shot every year?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. Yes, try to avoid strenuous activity with that arm for the rest of the day. And yes, it's recommended to get a flu shot annually, as the influenza strains change each year. We'll schedule you for one again next fall. I'm also going to print out some information about preventing the spread of influenza, just as a reminder. As for now, if you experience any unusual symptoms like a high fever, severe muscle aches, or difficulty breathing, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I'd like to see you back in six months for a follow-up appointment to discuss the blood test results and review your overall health. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, six months sounds good. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. And I’ll definitely let you know if anything seems off. I think I’m all set then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please stop by the front desk to schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. I’ll see you in six months. Take care, and have a wonderful day.
