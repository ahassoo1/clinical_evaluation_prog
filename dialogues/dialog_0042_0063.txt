DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, my back… it’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual, even. And… you know… with the cancer and all, I get worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, especially with your history. “Worse than usual” is helpful information. Can you tell me more about the back pain?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… it’s mostly in my lower back. Feels like a sharp ache, but sometimes it shoots down my leg. Not always, but when it does, it makes it hard to walk. It started… maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, but it’s getting worse every day. I try to move around, but it just… hurts more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp ache in your lower back radiating down the leg, worsening over the past week. That sounds quite uncomfortable. When you say it hurts more when you move, can you describe what kind of movements aggravate it specifically?
PATIENT: Hmmm… bending over is the worst. Like, picking something up off the floor? Forget about it. And… sitting for too long, too. Makes it really stiff. When I stand up after sitting, it’s a real struggle. Walking is okay for a little bit, but the longer I walk, the worse it gets. Especially going uphill.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending, prolonged sitting, and uphill walking seem to be the main triggers. And it’s worse with continued activity, which is good to know. Has anything specific caused this to start?
PATIENT: You know… that’s the thing. Nothing. I didn’t lift anything heavy, didn’t fall, didn’t do anything different. It just… started. Which is why I’m so worried, to be honest. It feels… different than the other back pain I've had.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs, especially with this being different than previous episodes and starting without a clear cause. Let’s talk a little bit more about your history with back pain. Have you experienced back pain before?
PATIENT: Yes. On and off for… a long time. Years. Doctor always said it was just my age, and being tall, I guess. And… the cancer treatment, sometimes makes it worse too. It’s usually just a dull ache, you know? Like a constant reminder. But this… this is sharp. And it shoots down my leg. It’s not just… there anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of chronic back pain, often described as a dull ache, sometimes exacerbated by cancer treatment, and now a new onset of sharp pain radiating down your leg. That's helpful. You mentioned cancer treatment. What type of treatment are you currently receiving, and when did you last complete a cycle?
PATIENT: I’m getting… the pills. Let me see… it’s called… Oh! Paclitaxel. Yes, Paclitaxel. And I finished my last cycle… um… let me think… it was July 15th. So, about two weeks ago. I go back for more next month.
DOCTOR: Okay, Paclitaxel, last cycle completed July 15th. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to ask some questions about other areas of your body, just to get a full picture. This is called a review of systems. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes my feet feel a little cold, but that’s usually just when I’m cold, you know? Nothing… strange. No tingling or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just occasional cold feet. And how about any weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… that's a good question. It takes a little effort to get up sometimes, like I said. But I don’t feel like my legs are giving out or anything. I can walk, I can climb stairs… it’s just… uncomfortable. Maybe a little slower than usual. But I wouldn't say I feel weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty with standing but no actual leg weakness. Let’s talk about your bladder and bowel function. Have you had any changes in urination or bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… no. Everything is… normal down there. No trouble going to the bathroom, no changes in… anything. Sorry if that's… a strange question. It’s just… you asked.
DOCTOR: It’s not a strange question at all, Ms. Meigs. It’s important to rule out any serious nerve involvement. Thank you for being so open. Now, before we do a physical exam, let’s quickly review your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides cancer?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. And… my knees bother me sometimes. Arthritis, the doctor said. But that’s it, I think. Just the cancer, the high blood pressure, and the knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, cancer, controlled high blood pressure, and arthritis. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long time ago. And… oh! I had a small thing on my skin removed a few years back. But that was small. Nothing major. That’s it, I think. Just the appendix and the skin thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a minor skin removal. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom… she had diabetes. And her mother… she had arthritis, really bad. And my brother… he had heart problems. But that’s it, really. Nothing… too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, arthritis, and heart problems. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no allergies to pills… nothing. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, can you tell me what medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… I take Paclitaxel, like we talked about. And… I take Lisinopril for my blood pressure. And… oh! And I take something for my knees, it’s… Naproxen. Yes, Naproxen. And… that’s it, I think. Paclitaxel, Lisinopril, and Naproxen.
DOCTOR: Okay, Paclitaxel, Lisinopril, and Naproxen. Thank you for that comprehensive list. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your back and legs. I’ll be palpating your spine and testing your reflexes and strength. Please let me know if anything is painful or uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s within a normal range. Your pulse is 72 and your temperature is 98.6. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently feel along your spine. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. Right there. That’s where it hurts the most. It’s really tender there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is definitely tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, specifically at L4-L5. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward as far as you comfortably can. Okay, and now backward. And finally, I'm going to ask you to bend side to side. I notice some limited range of motion with forward flexion, and pain with all movements. Now, let's check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to push against my hand with your legs. Can you push against my resistance?
PATIENT: I’m trying. It feels… weaker than usual, I think. It’s hard to tell. It hurts to push, too. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Strength is 4/5 bilaterally, which is slightly reduced, but not significantly. It is understandable that it’s difficult to assess accurately with the pain. Alright, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical examination, I am concerned about possible lumbar strain or a disc issue. The tenderness to palpation, limited range of motion, and slight weakness in your legs are consistent with these possibilities. Given your history of cancer and recent treatment, it’s also important to rule out any potential involvement of the spine. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the discs, nerves, and surrounding tissues. We’ll also order some blood work to rule out any inflammatory conditions. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds good. I want to know what’s going on, and if it’s something serious. MRI and blood work… yes, please. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ve ordered the MRI and blood work for you. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw. The MRI center will also contact you to schedule the scan. I’ll have the nurse print out the necessary paperwork for you. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take your Naproxen as directed for pain relief. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities. I'll also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the muscle spasms. I will be monitoring your results closely, and we can discuss the findings and next steps once they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… okay. That sounds good too. Will the MRI… will it show if the cancer has spread to my spine? That’s what I’m most worried about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs, and I understand your worry. The MRI will absolutely help us determine if there is any evidence of cancer involvement in your spine. It's a very sensitive imaging test, and we will be looking closely for any abnormalities. However, it’s important to remember that back pain is very common, and the vast majority of the time it’s not related to cancer. We are ordering the MRI to be thorough and rule out any serious causes, including cancer spread, but also to identify more common issues like a disc herniation or muscle strain. If anything concerning is found on the MRI, we will discuss it openly and honestly and develop a treatment plan together. In the meantime, try to stay positive and focus on managing your pain. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. That makes sense. I just… I worry a lot. No, I think that’s it for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I guess I’ll just wait for the lab and the MRI place to call. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It's perfectly natural to worry, and I'm here to answer any questions you have along the way. The nurse will come in shortly with the paperwork and instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as fever, weakness, numbness, or bowel/bladder changes. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a good day.
