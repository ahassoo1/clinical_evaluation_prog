DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. Yes. My ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? It’s been… a bit of a bother. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Things… slip my mind these days. It just… feels plugged.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness in your ear. I understand. And you said this has been going on for a bit, though you're unsure how long?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A bit. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… annoying. Makes it hard to hear folks sometimes. Especially my grandkids, and they already mumble enough! I… I used to be better at remembering things. Before… well. Never mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no pain, just a feeling of fullness and some difficulty hearing. Before we get too far, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms alongside this ear fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so… no dizziness. No ringing… maybe a little bit of… well, a sort of… muffled sound sometimes, but I figured that was just… old age. I really don’t know. It’s hard to say, Doctor. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or ringing in the ear, just a general muffled sound at times. Have you experienced any drainage from the ear, or any fever, headache, or recent cold or respiratory illness?
PATIENT: Drainage… no, definitely no drainage. Fever… not that I’ve noticed. I haven't been feeling sick, exactly. A bit tired, maybe, but that’s just… well, life. I think I had a bit of a sniffle a few weeks back, but it didn't last long. Nothing major. Just a normal little cold, I suppose. I can’t recall the date, though. Everything’s a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any issues with your ears before – infections, injuries, or any surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery… no, no surgery. Infections… I think I had one when I was a boy, maybe? A bad earache, I remember that. But it was a long time ago. As for injuries… I’ve worked with machinery all my life, farming, you know? Maybe bumped my head a few times, but nothing serious enough to… affect my ears, I don’t think. Honestly, Doctor, it’s hard to say for sure. It was all so long ago. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. And could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… Well, I’m a bit overweight, I suppose. And my knees aren’t what they used to be. I get a bit of shortness of breath when I’m doing something strenuous. But generally… I get by. I have private insurance, if that’s what you mean. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a while. Since… my wife passed. It’s just been… hard. Is that what you were asking, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Thank you for sharing that with me. And yes, that is relevant. Do you have any known allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. As for medical conditions… the doctor told me my blood pressure was a bit high a few years back, but he put me on some pills, and I think it was okay after that. I don’t remember the name of the pills, though. And no, no diabetes. I’m not a sweets man, thankfully. That’s about all I can think of, Doctor. It’s all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I think… yes. I take something for my knees, a white pill. And… something for my blood pressure, a small blue one, I think. That's all I can remember. I don't take any supplements. My daughter used to try and get me to take vitamins, but I never could keep track of them. It’s just… so much to remember, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you mind if I take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine. Go ahead. I suppose you need to… look at them. Hopefully it won’t be too unpleasant. I don’t really like anything poking around in my ears, but if you need to, you need to. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m looking in your ears now. I see some cerumen – earwax – in both ears, and some mild redness. The tympanic membranes – your eardrums – appear intact, but slightly dull. This could be due to the wax build-up, or possibly some fluid behind the ear. It's difficult to say for certain at this point.
PATIENT: Fluid? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I knew I shouldn't have ignored it for so long… but everything just feels like such an effort these days. What does that mean, exactly? And what can we do about it? I just want to be able to hear my grandkids again.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Fluid behind the eardrum can be caused by a number of things, including a mild infection, allergies, or even just a blockage from the wax. It's common. We’ll need to rule out anything serious, though. I recommend we start with a tympanometry test to assess the function of your middle ear and confirm the presence of fluid. We can do that here in the clinic. It’s a quick and painless test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A test… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. As long as it doesn't involve anything… poking around too much. And it’s quick, you say? I haven’t got all day, you know. Yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s very straightforward. You’ll sit comfortably in a chair, and I’ll place a small, soft tip into your ear canal. It won’t go in very far at all. It just measures how well your eardrum moves. It will take just a few seconds for each ear. It's completely painless. Are you ready when I am?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, let’s get it done. The sooner I can hear again, the better. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me when you’re about to do it, so I don’t jump.
