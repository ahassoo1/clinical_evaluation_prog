DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get some of these health forms signed and… verified, I guess you’d say. It’s for a program I’m trying to get into. I just need a notary, right? I hope this won't take too long, my bones aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. I can definitely help you with those forms. It sounds like you need a medical verification for a program application, and I can act as a notary for that. Let me just pull up your information here… Okay, Melvenia Tippens, date of birth… and I see your height and weight listed as well. Before we get started with the paperwork, though, just to be thorough, is there anything else going on with your health that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, those numbers are right. I'm a tall woman, always have been. And no, nothing else really. Just the forms. I feel alright, for my age. A little creaky in the mornings, but who isn’t? Really, I just need you to sign where they need you to, and… whatever else a notary does. I appreciate you fitting me in.
DOCTOR: Alright, “creaky in the mornings” – that’s good to know. We can definitely address that later if it becomes bothersome. Okay, so to be absolutely sure, when you say you feel "alright," that means no new pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness, no changes in your vision or appetite… anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. No new pains, thankfully. Breathing's fine. I can see just as well as I ever could, maybe a little harder to read small print, but that’s just getting old! And my appetite… well, it comes and goes, to be honest. But no big changes. I eat when I'm hungry, and sometimes I'm just not. Is that enough detail? I just want to get these papers done, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Melvenia. “Appetite comes and goes” is good to note. Just ruling things out, you know. Now, have you had any recent hospital stays or been to see any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: No, no hospital stays. And… hmm. Let me think. I went to the optometrist last year for my eyes, but that was just a check-up. And… I think that's it. I mostly just try to take care of myself at home. I don’t like going to doctors unless I really have to. It's expensive, you know, and I don't have insurance. It's a bother, honestly. Can we just get to the forms now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. I understand. No recent hospital stays, just the optometrist last year – noted. Okay, here are the forms. It looks like they need verification of your date of birth, height, and weight – which we’ve already confirmed – and a statement confirming you are of sound mind and able to understand the program's requirements. Do you have any questions about the forms themselves before I sign them?
PATIENT: No, they look alright to me. Just… where do I sign? And then you just… sign as a doctor? It’s that simple? I’m a little nervous about messing it up, my hands shake sometimes. Could you show me exactly where?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. It’s very straightforward. Right here, just initial and date. And then, here’s where I will sign and put my medical license number as verification. Don't worry about shaking, just take your time. If you need me to hold the paper steady, I'm happy to. And if it's not perfect, that’s alright. We can make a note of it. Just initial where you're comfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… Is that good enough? It's a little wobbly. I'm so sorry. I didn’t mean to bother you with this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Melvenia. It's absolutely legible, and that's what matters. Don’t apologize at all – this is what I’m here for. There we go. All signed and verified. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to quickly take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds okay. It's a quick check, and it doesn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I suppose that would be alright. But please be quick? I have… things to do. And I don't want to be a bother. Is it going to be uncomfortable? I hate having my blood pressure taken. It always makes me nervous, and then it’s probably higher than usual.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. Very quick, I promise. And I completely understand – getting your blood pressure taken can be stressful. We’ll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. It will be over before you know it. Alright, just take a few deep breaths… and relax. I'm going to inflate the cuff now.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m ready, I guess. But hurry, please. This is making my heart race even more.
DOCTOR: Okay… your blood pressure is 140/85. Your heart sounds regular and clear, and your lungs sound clear as well. That’s a little elevated, Melvenia, but not drastically so, and it could be due to the stress of the measurement itself. It’s good that your heart and lungs sound good. Now, just one more quick thing. Would you mind stepping on the scale so I can verify your weight?
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh, dear. I knew it. It's always elevated when they take it. It's just nerves, I tell you. Just nerves. Fine, the scale. Let's get this over with. I hope it's not too much trouble. I haven't gained any weight, I assure you. It's probably just the way it's calibrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, the scale reads 108 pounds. That's consistent with what we have documented previously. It’s good that your weight is stable. So, to recap, everything seems good overall. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but likely due to stress, and your heart and lungs sound good. Your weight is stable. Do you have any questions for me, Melvenia?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… can I go now? I really need to get home. I appreciate you signing the forms, and… checking me over. But I’m not a doctor, and I don’t understand all those numbers. I just needed the forms signed. Can I just take them and go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. Of course. Here are your signed forms. It was good meeting you. And don’t worry about the numbers – you’re right, you’re not a doctor! If you ever do have any health concerns, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s all. Thank you. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Melvenia. Have a good day. .
