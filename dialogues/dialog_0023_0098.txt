DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… kinda curious, ya know? Been feelin' okay, mostly. Just thought I’d get checked out. Never really been sick, but figured it couldn't hurt, right?
DOCTOR: "Curious," you say. Well, preventative care is… acceptable, I suppose. Though, frankly, wasting medical resources when you're perfectly healthy seems rather… illogical. Still. Let's get some information down. You say 'mostly' okay. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. Didn’t mean to waste time. “Mostly” okay… hmm. Sometimes I get a little tired, I guess. Not like sick tired, just… draggy. And my back… it kinda aches after a long shift on the boat. It’s a physical job, ya know? Been doin' it a while. But nothin' I can’t usually work through. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Draggy,” and a back ache after physical labor. Very specific. How long has this “draggy” feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Uhm… lemme think. Probably… a few months now? Maybe six months? It comes and goes. Some days I feel totally normal, other days… just kinda low energy. Not sad or nothin', just… not up. Like a battery that's not fully charged, maybe? I don’t really know how to explain it.
DOCTOR: A few months of intermittent fatigue. And you work on a boat… What kind of work specifically?
PATIENT: I’m a sailor, mostly. And a marine oiler. Gotta keep the engines runnin’ smooth, check all the fluids, that kinda stuff. Lots of liftin', bendin', climbin' around in tight spaces. It’s honest work. We haul cargo, mostly. Up and down the coast. Been doin’ it since I was eighteen. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: “Honest work” doesn’t preclude physical strain, Mr. Heindel. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I guess… I've been sleepin' a little more, maybe? Not a whole lot, just an extra hour here or there. And my appetite… it ain’t been huge lately. But I figured that was just 'cause I'm tired. Not really been feelin' hungry. No other symptoms or nothin'. Just the draggy feelin’ and the back.
DOCTOR: Intermittent fatigue, increased sleep, decreased appetite… and you claim to be otherwise healthy?
PATIENT: Well, yeah, mostly! I ain't been sick sick, like with a cold or the flu or nothin’. I just… figured it was stress, or the job, or somethin’. I ain’t one to complain, Doc. Never really needed to before. Is somethin' wrong? Should I be worried? Sorry if I'm bein' a bother.
DOCTOR: “Not a bother” is irrelevant, Mr. Heindel. However, dismissing potential health concerns due to personal stoicism is… unwise. Let’s proceed with a basic physical exam. I'd like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick examination of your back. It’s standard procedure. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Whatever ya think is best, Doc. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what ya need me to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie back. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. 140 over 90. Pulse is 72, regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are… unremarkable. Now, about your back. Can you point to where you’re experiencing the discomfort?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it's kinda all over, but mostly right here. And it kinda radiates down my legs sometimes, but not too bad. It’s just a dull ache, ya know? Not a sharp pain. Feels better when I'm movin', actually. Worse when I'm sittin’ still for too long.
DOCTOR: Tenderness is present upon palpation. Range of motion… limited, but not significantly so. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ugh… yeah, I can get down kinda far. But it's a little tight. Feels kinda stiff, ya know? It’s not comfortable, that's for sure. I gotta be careful with this. It flares up sometimes if I push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, tenderness upon palpation… Possible muscle strain or ligament sprain. Mr. Heindel, while a muscle strain is the most likely cause, your fatigue and decreased appetite warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. We’ll also get an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s goin' on. Blood tests and an X-ray, right? No problem. When do I need to come back for those results? And… how much is all this gonna cost? Just tryin’ to get a feel for things. I got Medicare, so hopefully it'll cover most of it.
DOCTOR: We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to discuss the results. As for cost, that is… difficult to estimate precisely. Medicare should cover a significant portion, but co-pays and potential deductibles apply. Our billing department can provide a more detailed estimate, but I’m not responsible for the intricacies of insurance policies. The lab order and X-ray requisition are being sent to the front desk. They’ll schedule the appointments for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. One week, avoid heavy liftin', ice it. Got it. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate ya takin’ the time to look into this. Hopefully it’s nothin' too serious. I gotta get back to work tomorrow, so… tryin’ to stay positive. Should I call if somethin’ gets worse before the appointment?
DOCTOR: "Positive" attitudes are commendable, Mr. Heindel, but irrelevant to objective medical findings. Yes. If you experience any significant worsening of your symptoms – such as severe pain, numbness or weakness in your legs, or a fever – you are to seek immediate medical attention. Do not simply “wait” for the appointment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. The front desk will handle the scheduling and any further questions you may have. .
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, got it. Thanks again, Doc. .
