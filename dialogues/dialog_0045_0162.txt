DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s…my stomach. It’s been puffed up. Like a balloon, almost. Honestly, it’s annoying. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: "Puffed up," okay. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really know. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Look, I work long hours, okay? Pile driving isn’t exactly a job where you sit around keeping track of puffiness. It’s just…there sometimes. Does that make sense? I don’t remember when it started, just that it's been happening.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, coming and going…Alright. And is it constant when it is there, or does it fluctuate even within a day?
PATIENT: Fluctuate? What does that even mean? It’s bigger sometimes, smaller other times. Like…when I eat, it gets worse. And when I…well, you know. When I go to the bathroom. Is that what you mean? Honestly, doc, I’m not a doctor. I just know it’s uncomfortable. And it's been happening since…well, since my wife passed, things haven't been the same. But I doubt that’s causing my stomach to blow up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to eating and bowel movements. And you mentioned some changes since your wife passed. I appreciate you sharing that, and while I understand loss can manifest in many ways, we need to focus on what's happening physically right now. Do you have any pain associated with the bloating?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Just…pressure. Like being really full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It's…uncomfortable, like a tight band around my waist. Look, I eat pretty regular, mostly just things to keep me going during the day. Sandwiches, burgers, the usual. Nothing fancy. I don’t sit around thinking about my stomach all day, doc. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, not pain, related to eating. No change in diet. Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation along with this?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. No throwing up. Sometimes...sometimes things are a little slow, if I’m being honest. Work is stressful, okay? It messes with things. But no diarrhea. Definitely not. Just…sluggish. And I wouldn't call it regular sluggish, just...not as quick as it used to be. Is that good enough for you? Honestly, I feel like I’m giving you my entire life story over a bloated stomach.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to get the full picture, Mr. Kristofik. Constipation, related to stress. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Look, no. Absolutely not. I wouldn’t even… I mean, if there was blood, I'd know, wouldn't I? That's a pretty obvious thing. I'm not an idiot. Can we please just figure out what’s causing this puffiness and get me back to work? I’ve got deadlines. Seriously. Is it something I ate? Because if it is, I can just avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood in the stool. Given your history and symptoms, it could be something dietary, but we need to rule out other things. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just something I ate. I eat a lot of gas station food. Maybe it’s that. Just… hurry up, okay? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your back for me, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this. It won't hurt. Okay. Sounds…a little hyperactive, some borborygmi present. Soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. A little distension noted, consistent with your report of bloating. No significant findings on examination. Given your symptoms and the physical, it's likely related to diet or possibly some mild irritable bowel syndrome. But to be thorough, I’d like to order a stool sample just to rule out anything more serious. It checks for infection, inflammation, things like that. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Stool sample? Seriously? You want a sample of…that? Look, I’m a pile driver operator, not a lab technician. Is it really necessary? It sounds like a waste of time, honestly. And I told you, it’s probably just something I ate. Can't I just try cutting out gas station food and see if that fixes it? I don’t have time for tests and samples. My deadlines… Is it going to take long? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: It's a relatively simple test, Mr. Kristofik. And it is important to rule out anything serious, like an infection or inflammation. It’s a standard part of investigating abdominal symptoms. It will take a few days to get the results back. Look, I understand you’re busy, and I respect that. But as your doctor, I need to be thorough. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your health. I can give you the collection kit and instructions to take home. It's a pretty straightforward process. And if it’s just dietary, we can discuss some modifications to try in the meantime. Would you be willing to do the stool sample?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Just get it over with. Give me the kit. But if it's nothing, you owe me an hour of my time back. Honestly, this is ridiculous. And don't expect me to be cheerful about this. Just…hand it over. I’ve got work to do. And make the instructions simple. I don't have time for complicated procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the kit. The instructions are straightforward. Collect a small sample, place it in the container, and bring it back to the lab within three days. It’s labeled clearly, and there’s a drop-off location at the front desk. In the meantime, let’s talk about dietary changes. Start by eliminating common gas-producing foods – beans, broccoli, cabbage, carbonated drinks. And see if reducing processed foods makes a difference. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the stool sample and how you’re feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever. I’ll try the food thing. No promises. Look, I really need to get back to work. So, is that it? Can I go now? I've got deadlines, remember? I'm a pile driver, doc. I don't have time for bloating and samples.
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, you’re free to go. Here’s a copy of your visit summary. And please, call the office if you have any concerns. Have a productive day, Mr. Kristofik. And try not to stress too much.
