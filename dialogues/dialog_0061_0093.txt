DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Chanz. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Uh, yeah, hello. Dr. Kimm, is it? Look, honestly, it’s a bit of a blur. Something about… not sleeping well? And, I guess, feeling a bit… unfit. My wife, bless her, she always said I needed to… well, never mind. It's just… things haven’t been right since she passed. It's been a while though, so I figured I'd get it checked out. Don’t really know where to begin, to be honest. It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your wife, Chanz. It's completely understandable that things feel fuzzy after a loss like that, and it’s very brave of you to come in and address how you're feeling. We'll take things at your pace, okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Good. Pace is good. Honestly, I just… I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. And then I’m tired all day. It’s just… irritating, more than anything. I used to be able to work all day, fixing instruments, no problem. Now? I’m dragging. And, frankly, I’ve put on a bit of weight. Not ideal for someone on their feet all day, you know? It’s just… a general lack of… pep, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so waking up feeling unrefreshed despite getting what you think is enough sleep, fatigue throughout the day, and some weight gain. And this has been going on for a while now?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… about the size of it. A while… I don’t know how long. Months, definitely. Maybe longer? Time… it kind of blends together, you know? I really can't pinpoint it. It’s just… gradually got worse. I keep meaning to… I don’t know, do something about it, but then I just… don’t. It's easier to just… carry on, I guess. Though, not very efficiently, admittedly. Do you… need a specific date or something? Because I really can’t tell you.
DOCTOR: No, it's okay, Chanz. We don't need a precise date. “Months” is helpful enough. It sounds like this has been a gradual process, which is important to know. Besides the sleep and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other changes… Let me think. My appetite’s… gone a bit wonky. Sometimes I don’t feel like eating at all, and other times I just… eat whatever’s there. Not particularly healthy stuff, if I’m honest. I used to be quite particular about my food, needing proper fuel for the work, but now… it's just whatever’s easiest. And I've been… a bit irritable, I suppose. Snapping at people. Not intentionally, of course, but I’ve noticed it. It’s probably just the tiredness, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, changes in appetite – sometimes not hungry, sometimes eating whatever's available – and increased irritability. That’s helpful. And has this been affecting your work at all, beyond just the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Used to be able to fix a violin in an afternoon, no problem. Now? I’m struggling with simple repairs. Losing focus. Making mistakes. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I take pride in my work, always have. Now I feel like I'm just… going through the motions. Customers haven't said anything, but I can tell. They just… don’t come back as often. It's… a bit demoralizing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. That sounds really frustrating, especially when you take so much pride in your craftsmanship. It's good you're recognizing these changes and coming in to get things checked out. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Not really. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. Had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. But nothing major. I've got Medicare, of course, but I haven't used it much. Just for the annual check-ups, mostly. I think… I think the doctor gave me a clean bill of health every time. Honestly, I can't really recall the specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major medical conditions diagnosed, generally healthy, and routine check-ups with a clean bill of health. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, none that I can recall. Absolutely none. I've always been careful, you know? Avoided anything too risky. I don’t even like going to the dentist, let alone having… well, you know. Definitely no surgeries. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… that’s… tricky. My wife’s side of the family… they had some heart problems, I think. Her mother, definitely. And maybe an aunt? I wasn’t terribly close to them, to be honest, so I don’t know the specifics. My own parents… my father died relatively young, of… I think it was just old age, really. He wasn't a very healthy man, always smoking, drinking. I don’t really know if there were any particular conditions that ran in the family, if that makes sense. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Some heart problems on your wife’s side, and your father had some health issues, but not a strong family history of specific conditions. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. My wife hated it, and I certainly didn’t want to upset her. And frankly, I’ve always valued my lungs. Need them for breathing, you know? No. Definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have the occasional glass of wine with dinner, that's it. Nothing excessive. A small glass, maybe two, on a Friday or Saturday. Just to relax. Nothing more. I’m not a big drinker, never have been. It never agreed with me particularly well, to be honest. I’ve never relied on it to… well, you know, cope with things. Just a social drink now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking, nothing excessive. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness no! Absolutely not. Never have, never will. Completely pointless. And, frankly, rather… vulgar. I have always been a very… stable individual. I prefer to keep my mind clear. No. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. No recreational drug use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I might be slightly sensitive to dust, sometimes get a bit of a tickle in my throat, but that’s just… dust, isn't it? Nothing serious. I don’t take any medication regularly, so I haven’t had any reactions to that. No. I don't believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. Thank you for answering all those questions, Chanz. It gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your heart rate, blood pressure, listen to your lungs, that sort of thing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I’m… used to being poked and prodded, fixing instruments and all. Hopefully you won’t find anything too dreadful. Just… be gentle, alright? My wife always said I was a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. I will be as gentle as possible. Blood pressure is 140/90… a little elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 80, regular. Now I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me, if you could. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on both sides, but nothing immediately concerning. I'm going to check your thyroid now… and just take a look in your ears. Everything looks okay so far, but we'll need to run some blood tests to get a more complete picture. Is there anything in particular that you've noticed, like any swelling or pain?
PATIENT: Swelling or pain… no, not really. Nothing I can recall, anyway. I might get a bit of a… ache in my neck sometimes, but I just put that down to being old. Spending hours hunched over instruments, you know? It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And I occasionally get a bit of a… blockage in my ears, like when you’re flying, but it usually clears up on its own. I haven’t noticed anything particularly concerning. Honestly, I’m… not very good at noticing things like that. My wife was always the one who kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional neck aches and ear blockage. That's helpful to know. Now, I’m just going to take your temperature and have a quick look at your throat. Temperature is normal, and your throat looks clear. Just a little redness, but that could be due to a number of things. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms that could be related to a number of things, including stress, fatigue, and potentially some underlying medical issues. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests sound sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of it, really. I'm just… tired of feeling like this. Honestly, it’s a relief to finally be doing something about it. Will they be… unpleasant? I don’t really like needles, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: They shouldn’t be too unpleasant, Chanz. It’s just a quick prick, and then it’s done. We’ll take the blood from your arm, and the phlebotomist is very good. They'll get it over with quickly. It’s a small discomfort for a lot of peace of mind. I’m also going to order a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to check your thyroid function, and a Vitamin D level. Also, given the fatigue, we'll check a complete metabolic panel, just to look at your basic organ function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. All of that sounds… thorough, which is good. Vitamin D… I haven’t seen much sun lately. Spending all day indoors, repairing instruments, you know? I suppose that makes sense. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… let’s get it over with quickly, if you wouldn’t mind. And… could I have a glass of water afterwards? My mouth feels a bit dry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A glass of water is no problem at all. And we’ll get the blood draw over with as quickly as possible. I’ll write the lab order now, and then the nurse will come in and take you to the lab. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness – please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Chest pain, shortness of breath… I’ll keep an eye out for those. A few days… that doesn’t sound too bad. I’m… grateful for your help, Doctor. It’s been… a long time since I felt like someone was actually listening. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. I’m glad I could help. It’s my job to listen, and to help you get back to feeling your best. We’ll get those tests done, and then we’ll go from there. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again. Honestly, it’s a weight off my shoulders. Just getting it checked out. And… perhaps a quiet cup of tea later? That sounds rather nice. No. That’s all. Really. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chanz. I'm glad I could help. A quiet cup of tea sounds lovely. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
