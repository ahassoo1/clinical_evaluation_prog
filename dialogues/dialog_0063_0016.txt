DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my patient, Mrs. Henderson. She’s been bruising… a lot more than usual, and she’s on that blood thinner, you know, warfarin. I’ve seen a definite uptick in the last couple weeks, and frankly, it’s concerning. She's a bit of a worrywart, so it could be nothing, but I’d rather be safe than sorry, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, patients do tend to exaggerate. Warfarin... naturally, bruising is a side effect. Has her INR been checked recently?
PATIENT: Oh, of course it has. I’m a pathologist, Doctor, not an amateur. It was… let me see… last Tuesday. It was within range, 2.1, I believe. A little on the lower side, actually. Which is… puzzling, considering the bruising. She hasn’t changed anything in her diet, has she? Though, knowing her, she probably has. She's always tinkering with those herbal remedies she reads about online.
DOCTOR: Herbal remedies... precisely what I suspected. Those are rarely helpful, and often interfere with proper medication management. And a slightly low INR with increased bruising... it is unusual. Has she sustained any injuries, even minor ones, that she hasn't reported?
PATIENT: Injuries? No, she’s quite frail, Doctor. She wouldn't be getting into any adventures. She mostly sits and knits. Though… now that you mention it, she did complain about bumping her elbow on the coffee table a few days ago. Said it didn’t hurt, barely even noticed it. But a small bruise did appear. Honestly, she probably just imagined bumping her elbow. She’s getting on, you know. Things happen when you're old.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Age does play a role. It’s likely simply a case of increased sensitivity. Still, we should document it. I suppose we can order a CBC to rule out any other abnormalities. But I doubt it will reveal anything significant. Perhaps a gentle reminder to Mrs. Henderson regarding the importance of adhering to her medication schedule and avoiding… alternative therapies.
PATIENT: A CBC is… sensible, I suppose. Though I maintain it’s likely nothing. She’s just… dramatic. And you’re right about the reminders. I’ll have my nurse go over everything with her again. Honestly, dealing with patients these days… it’s more about hand-holding than actual medicine. It’s… tiresome. Is that all, Doctor? I have other appointments to attend to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that will be all, Mr. Farson. I’ll have the results faxed to your office as soon as they are available. Please, do encourage Mrs. Henderson to be more… forthcoming with information regarding her habits. And, if the bruising does worsen, or she reports any other symptoms, you know where to find me. Though I highly doubt it will come to that. Good day.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. I’ll… relay the message. Frankly, I doubt she’s hiding anything. She just overreacts. Very well, Doctor. Good day to you as well. .
DOCTOR: Good day. .
