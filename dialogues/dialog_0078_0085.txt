DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s this… discoloration. It's really quite bothersome, and frankly, a little embarrassing. It started a few weeks ago, and I’d like to get it checked out before it… gets worse, I suppose. It’s on my hands, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Discoloration on your hands that’s been present for a few weeks. That is a good reason to come in and get it evaluated. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discoloration a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… even. It’s patchy, you see? Some spots are a bit brown, others are almost… grayish. Not a nice gray, mind you. And it’s not raised or anything. Just… color. Like someone took a brush and decided to paint little bits of my hands. It’s quite unsightly, really. I’ve always taken pride in my appearance.
DOCTOR: I see. Patchy brown and grayish discoloration, not raised, and you haven’t noticed any changes in texture. That helps. And you said it started a few weeks ago – can you recall anything that might have coincided with the start of the discoloration?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A few weeks ago… Oh! Yes. My husband and I, we started doing a bit of gardening. He insisted. I mostly just helped with the weeding, but I did handle some new soil. And some… some fertilizer, I believe. It was a bit dusty, I recall. Though I washed my hands thoroughly afterwards, naturally. One always washes one’s hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening and handling new soil and fertilizer a few weeks ago. That's very helpful information. Have you noticed the discoloration spreading since then?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. At first, it was just on the back of my hands. Now, it's… creeping onto my fingers, a little. Not all of them, thankfully. But it’s definitely getting bigger. It’s not a rapid spread, mind you, but it’s noticeable. And it doesn’t seem to be… fading, even with all the hand cream I’ve been using. It’s quite persistent, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's spreading from the back of your hands to your fingers, and it doesn't seem to be improving with hand cream. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this discoloration?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No itching, no pain, no blisters, no swelling. Just the… color. Honestly, it's mostly just an aesthetic issue. Though, I do worry it might be… something serious. One hears such dreadful things these days. And my mother always said to get everything checked out, no matter how small. She was a very cautious woman, my mother.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out, as your mother advised. No itching, pain, blisters, or swelling is good. Let's do a quick physical exam of your hands. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Please, do examine them. I suppose the sooner we know what it is, the better. I do hope it’s nothing too alarming. Honestly, the thought of… well, never mind. Let’s just see what you think, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you’ll just extend your hands for me, palms up please. Okay, I’m noting the discoloration as you described. The texture feels normal, no bumps or thickening. There is no tenderness to the touch. The discoloration appears primarily on the dorsal surfaces of your hands and is beginning to extend onto a few of your fingers. I don't see any evidence of blistering or open sores. It appears fairly symmetrical. Is there a family history of skin conditions, anything like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm… a family history… Let me think. My grandmother, on my father’s side, she had very sensitive skin. Always complaining about rashes. But I don’t think it was anything… dramatic. More of a constant irritation, really. She used to use all sorts of herbal remedies. And my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had a bit of… eczema, I believe, as a child. But she grew out of it, I think. It wasn’t a serious condition, if I recall correctly. Nothing like this, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of sensitive skin in your grandmother and childhood eczema in your aunt. That’s helpful to know. Given your history of gardening and handling new soil and fertilizer, the discoloration’s appearance, and your family history, it’s possible this could be a form of contact dermatitis – an allergic reaction or irritation from something you came into contact with. However, to be certain, I'd like to rule out other possibilities. Would you be comfortable with a simple patch test?
PATIENT: A patch test? What does that entail, exactly? I’m not terribly fond of… needles, if that makes any difference. And I do have a rather busy schedule, you see. Though, I suppose if it’s necessary… what would be involved? And how long would it take?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. A patch test is very simple and doesn't involve needles. We apply a small amount of various common allergens to a patch on your back, cover it, and then you leave it on for a few days. It allows us to see if you have a reaction to any specific substances. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes to apply the patches, and then you’ll need to return in about 48-72 hours for me to evaluate the results. We can discuss scheduling that at a time that works best for you. Alternatively, we could start with a topical steroid cream and see if that improves the discoloration. However, a patch test is more definitive and can help us pinpoint the cause, so you can avoid it in the future. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… a cream sounds… less invasive, certainly. And quicker. Though you are right, identifying the cause would be sensible. I suppose if it’s a simple application… I’m not overly keen on having things stuck to my back for days, but if it’s the most thorough approach… Alright. Let’s do the patch test. But please, be quick about it. And I hope it doesn’t require me to change my schedule too drastically. I have a luncheon with the Historical Society on Thursday.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concerns, and we'll make it as quick and convenient as possible. We can schedule the patch application for tomorrow morning, and the follow-up appointment for Friday to avoid conflicting with your luncheon. Before we proceed, do you have any known allergies to adhesives or any sensitivities to bandages?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate with my skin, despite my grandmother’s complaints. I’ve used plasters and bandages throughout my life without any issue. Though, I must admit, I haven't had anything stuck to my back before. This is… novel. Please, let’s get it over with quickly, shall we? And try to be gentle. I do have quite sensitive skin, you know. Even if it hasn’t reacted to plasters before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. All the panels are applied. I've covered them with a protective dressing to keep them dry and in place. It’s important to avoid getting the area wet for the next 48-72 hours, and also to avoid strenuous activity that might cause excessive sweating. You may experience some mild itching or redness, but that's normal. I've given you written instructions with detailed aftercare advice and information about what to look out for. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. We’ll see you Friday morning at 10 AM for the results. Is that still convenient?
PATIENT: Yes, Friday at ten is perfectly fine. I’ve made a note of it in my planner. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I do appreciate it. I truly hope this doesn't take too long to resolve. I have a presentation to prepare for the Historical Society next month, and I would prefer not to have unsightly patches on my back during it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I'll go home and avoid getting my back wet. And perhaps apply a little hand cream. One can never be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I understand. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly.
