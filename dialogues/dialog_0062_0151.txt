DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It's been… a little while now. Not terrible, just… annoying, really. I’m Teretha Uzarski, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s nice to meet you too, Teretha. Annoying is a good way to put it – those little things can really get to you. Okay, tingling in your hands and feet… and you said it’s been going on for a little while?
PATIENT: Yes, a few months now, I think. Maybe six? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s like pins and needles, other times just… numb. It’s harder to do things with my hands when it's bad. I do a lot with my hands at work, you know, sorting mail. It makes things…difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, coming and going, sometimes pins and needles, sometimes numbness, and it’s making it harder to sort mail. That’s good information. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be worse after a long day, or after being cold… I mean, it’s winter where I am now, but it wasn’t much better in the summer, honestly. I wish I knew something to tell you, but it just… happens.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint a trigger. So, it's pretty consistent, regardless of activity or weather. Now, has this tingling spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, just my hands and feet. Not my arms or legs, thankfully. And it’s not… achy, or painful, just… weird. It’s hard to explain. Like when your foot falls asleep, but… less intense, and it doesn’t go away on its own right away.
DOCTOR: Okay, just hands and feet, not painful, more of a weird sensation like a foot falling asleep but less intense and doesn't resolve quickly. That's helpful. Now, thinking a bit broader… have you noticed any other changes since this started?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been a little more clumsy, maybe? Dropping things more often. I blamed that on just getting older, honestly. And… oh, my balance isn’t what it used to be. I nearly tripped on the steps last week. But I thought that was just… old age again, too!
DOCTOR: Okay, increased clumsiness and some balance issues. It's good you're telling me about these things, even if you thought they were just related to age. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… oh, must be twenty years now? And high blood pressure, but I don't take anything for it. The doctor said to watch my salt, which I try to do. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and high blood pressure that you manage with diet. And no other major medical issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual aches and pains of getting older. My husband… well, he passed away a few years back, and honestly, I haven’t been as good about seeing the doctor since then. It's silly, I know, but…
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Teretha. Losing a loved one makes it hard to keep up with things, and it’s not silly at all. So, just to confirm, no history of diabetes or heart problems. And you’re not currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: That’s right. No medications at all. Just trying to eat right and… take it easy. I used to be so active, but… it's harder now. Everything's harder now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication… I don’t think I’ve ever had an allergy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family with similar symptoms, like tingling in the hands and feet, or problems with balance?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands, but it was different. More pain, swelling… not tingling. My brother… he had some nerve problems later in life, but I don't remember the details, honestly. He lived far away, and we didn't talk often. It wasn't like it is now with the phone, you know? Hard to remember details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s understandable. So, some arthritis in your mother and some nerve problems in your brother, but not a clear history of the same symptoms. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a while, but I always hated it. Made the house smell awful, and he always coughed. I made him quit, eventually. I don't have much patience for bad habits.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy. Maybe two or three times a week. It helps me relax, you know? After a long day sorting mail, it’s nice to unwind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine a few times a week. Now, just one more question about your social history. Are you exposed to any chemicals or toxins at work?
PATIENT: Well, I sort mail. There’s ink, sometimes. And paper dust. I’ve been doing it for so long, I don’t even notice it anymore. There's a lot of handling different envelopes, you know, different people send different things. But nothing… dangerous, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, some exposure to ink and paper dust at work. Alright, Teretha, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It’ll just involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? It’s just… annoying. Let's get it over with, if you don’t mind. I have mail to sort tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take our time. Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if this is going to be… unpleasant. I’m a bit sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Just a quick tap. It shouldn’t be painful, just a little startling. Okay… good. And now the other side… Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, let’s check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It feels a little weak, but that’s probably just… old age, right? I used to be so much stronger.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. It’s good you’re telling me how you feel. And you’re right to mention it. Your grip strength is a little diminished on both sides, but it’s not dramatically different. Now, let's move on to sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Go ahead. I hope I don’t mess this up. My hands aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay… and now this side… Hmmm… interesting. There seems to be some decreased sensation in your fingers and toes, particularly distally—that means farther away from your hand and foot. Not a complete loss of sensation, but noticeably diminished. Okay, Teretha, that's all for the physical exam for now. Everything else looks normal. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy. That’s a condition where the nerves in your hands and feet are damaged, causing symptoms like tingling, numbness, and weakness. There are many possible causes, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, certain medications, and even just age. But given your history, we need to rule out a few things before we can say for sure. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests, you say? Alright, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? So yes, blood tests are fine. But… will they take a lot of blood? I don't do well with needles.
DOCTOR: It sounds scary, I understand. Peripheral neuropathy just means nerve damage, and it's often manageable. We just need to find the cause. And no, the blood tests won't take a lot of blood. Just a few vials, standard tests. The nurse will be very gentle, I promise. We'll also check your thyroid. Sometimes that can cause similar symptoms. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d recommend taking some extra care with your hands and feet. Avoid repetitive motions as much as possible, keep them warm, and check them regularly for any cuts or blisters. Do you have any trouble with your feet, like difficulty walking or balance issues?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not too scary, then. I appreciate you explaining it, Doctor. And yes, I mentioned I nearly tripped last week. It’s not constant, but my balance isn't what it used to be, that’s for sure. And I do get… little aches in my feet sometimes, especially after a long day sorting mail. It's just… old age, probably.
DOCTOR: It's good you told me about the balance issues and the aches. We'll definitely keep that in mind. It’s not necessarily just old age, and that's why we’re doing these tests. To rule things out and get a clearer picture. Okay, so I’ll write the lab orders for you now. The nurse will schedule the blood draw. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. It may involve further testing, or it may simply require some lifestyle modifications and vitamin supplementation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Lifestyle modifications and vitamins… I can manage that. Just… please don’t tell me it’s something terrible. I don’t think my heart could take it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha. And I promise you, we will take things one step at a time. It's very likely this is something we can manage effectively. We will rule out the more serious possibilities first. And I will explain everything to you clearly, every step of the way. I will also give you information on resources to help manage the condition, whatever it turns out to be. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vitals and explain the lab procedure. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old woman who worries too much. And thank you for not making me feel like I’m crazy.
DOCTOR: You’re not crazy at all, Teretha. Your concerns are valid, and it’s always best to get things checked out. And you're not an "old woman"—you're a valuable patient, and I'm glad you came in today. Alright, the nurse will be right with you. I'll see you in a few days to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Teretha.
PATIENT: .
