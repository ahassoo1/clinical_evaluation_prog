DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Dr... Rakosky, right? Yes, yes. It’s... something down there. Something not right. It's... leaking. A little. Not a lot, but... it’s there. And it smells funny. I don't know what's causing it. It's embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, Rakosky is correct. And please, don't feel embarrassed. These things happen, and we're here to help. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "down there," are you referring to the vaginal area?
PATIENT: Vaginal? No, no. Not there. Down there. You know… the other place. For… peeing. It’s… on him. It's not me leaking, it's... well, never you mind who. It just... started happening a few days ago. It's just… strange. I haven’t been with anyone in a long time, so I don’t know what it could be. It just… happens when he stands up.
DOCTOR: I understand now. You're saying the leakage occurs from the urethra – the opening where urine comes out – and it happens when this other individual stands up. Okay. To clarify, is this happening consistently when he stands, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Inter… what? Oh. Sometimes. Not every time. Sometimes he stands up and nothing. Sometimes a little drip. Sometimes a bit more. It's not a flood, mind you. Just... enough to notice. And the smell... like old fish, almost. I don’t know why he doesn’t just clean himself better, honestly. It’s just… not proper. It’s his responsibility, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent leakage with a fishy odor. That is helpful information. A fishy odor can sometimes indicate an infection. Ms. Genard, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about his overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, his health? He’s… old. Older than me, even. But stubborn as a mule. He doesn't like going to doctors. Says they just want to poke and prod. He mostly sits around and watches TV. He drinks a lot of beer. And eats a lot of… fried things. He used to work with boats, a long time ago. Before I met him. But he doesn’t do much anymore. Just complains a lot. He says his joints hurt. That's all I really know, I guess. I don't ask too many questions. It just… makes things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some joint pain, a history of boat work, and a diet high in fried foods and beer. That’s helpful. Given his age and these factors, we need to consider a few possibilities. Ms. Genard, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about his urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary… habits? Oh dear. What do you need to know? He goes to the bathroom… when he needs to go. What else is there to say? He doesn’t tell me everything, you know. He's a private man. Sometimes he goes more often at night. Keeps me awake, honestly. And he strains a bit sometimes. But… that’s just old age, isn’t it? I don’t know why you need to know all these details. It’s… embarrassing for both of us.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Genard, and I apologize if I’m asking sensitive questions. These details are important, though, because they can help us determine the cause of the leakage and the odor. When you say he strains, does he have difficulty starting to urinate, or does it take a long time to empty his bladder completely?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s both, I think. He sits there… and pushes. A long time. And then he has to go back again a little while later. Says he didn't get everything out. He complains about the pressure. Says it feels like… a rock is stuck. And he makes… noises. Grunting and straining. It’s not a pretty sight, let me tell you. I try not to listen. But it’s hard when you share a small house. It’s just… getting worse. I really wish he’d just see a doctor. But he won’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. Difficulty starting urination, straining, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and a sensation of pressure – these are all concerning symptoms. Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like he may be experiencing urinary retention and possibly an enlarged prostate. Now, I understand he's reluctant to see a doctor, but it's really important that he gets evaluated. An enlarged prostate can cause several complications, including infections and kidney damage. Would you be willing to let me speak with him directly, perhaps over the phone, to explain the potential risks and encourage him to come in for an examination?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Talk to him? He'd just yell at you, I promise. He doesn't listen to anyone. Not me, not anyone. He thinks he knows everything. He'll say it’s just his age, and to leave him alone. It’ll be a waste of your time. Honestly, I don’t think it’s worth the trouble. Just… is it serious? Will he… die? I’m mostly worried about that. If it's not life-threatening, I don’t want to bother him. He gets so angry when I try to help. It’s just… easier to ignore it. Maybe it will just go away on its own?
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. It's never easy dealing with a stubborn loved one. While I cannot definitively say whether this is life-threatening without a proper examination, the symptoms you’ve described can lead to serious complications, such as kidney infections and, in rare cases, kidney failure. It’s also possible there’s an underlying infection causing the odor, and that needs to be ruled out. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away, and it could potentially worsen over time. Given his age and symptoms, I strongly recommend he gets evaluated. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Instead of focusing on a full examination right away, we could start with some simple tests, like a urine sample, to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would he be more willing to agree to that?
PATIENT: A urine sample… hmm. Maybe. He hates going to the bathroom in public, so that might be a problem. But at least he wouldn’t have to be poked and prodded. And it’s quick, right? Just a little cup? If it doesn’t take long and he can do it at home, maybe he’d agree. But he’ll complain, I guarantee it. He always complains. And he’ll probably drink too much water beforehand, and then the sample will be diluted. Honestly, it’s going to be a struggle. But… alright. I’ll try. I’ll ask him. But don’t get your hopes up. He’s a very difficult man. What do we do with the cup?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful start, Ms. Genard, thank you. And don’t worry, we can work around the potential for dilution. He doesn't need to drink excessively, and we can provide specific instructions to help ensure a good sample. I’ll give you a sterile collection cup and a set of instructions. It’s best if he collects the sample mid-stream – meaning he starts urinating, then collects the sample a few seconds later – and brings it in within two hours. We have a cooler bag available to keep it refrigerated if needed. Here are the instructions, and here’s the cup. Please let him know to avoid collecting the very first or last part of the stream. And if he’s taking any medications, it would be helpful if you could make a list of those as well. Now, while we wait for the sample, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your own health, if you don't mind. This is a good opportunity to ensure you're also receiving the care you need.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A cooler bag… good idea. He’ll probably complain about that too, but… alright. And a list of his medications… that’ll take me forever. He keeps them all hidden in different places. He says he doesn't need to remember them, because he knows what he's taking. Men. As for me… well, I’m just fine. A little achy sometimes, but that’s just old age. I don’t go to the doctor. Never have. What’s the point? They just tell you to eat better and exercise. I've lived this long, haven't I? I don’t need anyone telling me what to do. Just… check on him, alright? Make sure he doesn’t yell at you. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Genard. We'll certainly do our best to ensure a pleasant experience for him. And rest assured, we're here to help both of you. So, to recap, you’ll collect a urine sample from him as soon as possible, and bring it in within two hours. You’ll also make a list of his medications, if you’re able. In the meantime, if you notice any worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, increased pain, or difficulty urinating – please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… try to be patient with him. He's a grumpy old man, and he doesn't like being told what to do. And thank you… for listening. It's nice to finally talk to someone about this. It's been worrying me for a while now. Alright. I’ll go home and see if I can find a cup. And the list… oh dear. That’s going to be a challenge. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Genard. We're here to help in any way we can. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns along the way. We’ll be looking forward to receiving the sample. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself as well. .
