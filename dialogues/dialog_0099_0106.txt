DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington, welcome. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. This sore, it just won’t heal. It's been… a while now. Honestly, I thought it would be better by now. I’ve tried all sorts of things, you know, creams and whatnot. And it's painful. Really painful to walk on. It's on my… left foot, I believe. Though they both ache, to be fair.
DOCTOR: Right, a sore on your left foot that’s not healing and is painful to walk on. And you’ve been trying creams… okay. Let’s start with how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… hmm. Before my grandson visited, I think. He came in May, didn’t he? Yes, May. So, that would be… about three months now, maybe a little longer. Time just slips away, you know. And it’s gotten worse, slowly but surely. Not suddenly, mind you. I'm not one for dramatics.
DOCTOR: Three months, alright. And you said it’s been gradually worsening, not a sudden onset of pain?
PATIENT: Exactly. It wasn’t like I stubbed my toe or anything. Just… started as a little spot, really. I didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, you know. Things just… happen. Then it got red, and now… well, now it's this awful sore. And quite unsightly, if I may say so myself. I used to have such nice feet, always took care of them.
DOCTOR: I see. And where on your left foot exactly is this sore located?
PATIENT: Oh, it's right on the bottom, near my heel. Well, a little to the side, if you must know. Not directly on the heel, but close enough. It's hard to describe. And honestly, it’s not a pleasant sight. I try not to look at it too much, it just… discourages me. But it’s definitely on the bottom, that much I can tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, bottom of the left foot, near the heel, slightly to the side. Have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm. I don't know about pus, specifically. There's… moisture. Yes, moisture. And sometimes it gets on my sock. It's not a lot, mind you, but it’s there. A yellowish sort of color, I think. Honestly, I just try to keep it covered. It’s much cleaner that way. It's a bit embarrassing, really, talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Right, some yellowish moisture coming from the sore. And you’re keeping it covered, good. Now, besides the pain and the moisture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… my leg feels a little warm sometimes. Just that leg, not both. And it's a little…swollen, I suppose. Not terribly, mind you. But if I compare it to my other leg, it's definitely a bit bigger. I haven’t said anything to anyone about it, though. Probably just my imagination. Old legs swell, don't they?
DOCTOR: Alright, some warmth and swelling in your left leg. It's good you’re observant. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Diabetes, definitely. The doctor told me years ago, a long time ago now. I take pills for it, every day. And… something about my blood, I think. Not good circulation, he said. I don’t really remember all the details. I'm not good with medical jargon, and frankly, I stopped asking questions. Doctors always talk so fast. But yes, I have the diabetes. And the bad blood. It's why my feet get cold, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and circulation issues. Do you know what medications you’re taking for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a little bag here with my pills. Hmm… Metformin, that’s one. And… Glipizide, I think. Yes, those two. Every morning and every evening, religiously. My daughter helps me fill the little pill organizer, so I don’t get confused. She's a good girl, my daughter. Keeps me on track. But yes, metformin and glipizide. That’s what I take. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, metformin and glipizide. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve taken a lot of pills in my life, you know, and never had a reaction. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. I used to be allergic to penicillin, years ago, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t taken that in decades. So, no, no allergies to speak of. At least, none that I know about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we take a look at your foot, let me ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with diabetes, foot ulcers, or circulation issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had diabetes too, I believe. And her feet… well, they weren't good. She had to… she had a part of her foot removed, I think. A long time ago, before my time. And my brother, he had terrible circulation. Always complaining about cold feet, just like me. So, yes. Diabetes and bad circulation, on both sides of the family. It seems to run in the blood, you know. Bad luck, really.
DOCTOR: Right, family history of diabetes and circulation issues. Okay. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to take a look at your foot. Please remove your shoe and sock, when you’re ready. We'll start with a physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. It might be a little uncomfortable, so let me know if anything hurts.
PATIENT: Alright. Very well. Just give me a moment. Old bones don’t move as quickly as they used to. There. Be careful, it's quite tender. And please try not to make a fuss, I don’t like a lot of commotion.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore. It is tender to the touch, as you mentioned. There's some redness and swelling around it. The skin feels warm compared to your other foot. I'm going to check your pulses in your foot and leg to assess the circulation. Your dorsalis pedis pulse is a bit weak, and your posterior tibial pulse is also diminished. This does suggest some reduced circulation in your lower leg. I'm also going to check sensation in your foot. Hmm. Sensation seems reduced in several areas, particularly around the sore. This is concerning, as reduced sensation can lead to further complications. Alright. So, to summarize: tender sore near the heel with redness and swelling, weak pulses, and reduced sensation. This is consistent with a diabetic foot ulcer, likely complicated by peripheral artery disease and neuropathy. We need to get this addressed quickly to prevent infection and potential further complications.
PATIENT: Well. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Diabetic… foot ulcer. Peripheral… what was it? Sounds terrible. So, what does this mean? Am I going to lose my foot? My brother lost a toe, you know. I don't want to lose my foot. What are we going to do about it? And will it hurt? I have a very low tolerance for pain, you see. Please tell me, Doctor. Don’t sugarcoat it. I want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be worried. You’re right to ask direct questions. Losing a limb is a serious concern, and we’re going to do everything we can to prevent that. The “peripheral artery disease” just means that the blood flow to your foot is reduced, which is common in people with diabetes. The reduced sensation means you might not feel pain or notice small injuries, which can lead to ulcers like this one. Right now, the goal is to prevent infection and promote healing. The good news is, we caught this relatively early, and with proper care, we have a good chance of getting it under control. We’ll start with some blood tests to assess your overall health and check for infection. We’ll also need to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there’s any bone infection. Then, we’ll need to debride the wound – that means carefully removing any dead or infected tissue to allow it to heal. This might cause some discomfort, but we can use local anesthetic to minimize the pain. We’ll also need to offload the pressure on your foot – that means reducing the amount of weight you put on it. We can do this with special shoes or orthotics. Depending on the severity, you might also need antibiotics to treat or prevent infection. I'm going to refer you to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – who can provide more specialized care. I also want you to schedule an appointment with a vascular surgeon to evaluate your circulation. I know this is a lot to take in, but please know that we’re going to work together to get this under control. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Vascular surgeon… podiatrist… it’s just one specialist after another. It sounds… complicated. And painful. Will I be able to walk? I like to walk to the store, you know. It’s good for me. And how long will this take? I don't want to be stuck in the house for months. The local anesthetic… is that a shot? I really don’t like shots. And what if it doesn't work? Will it hurt terribly then? And the antibiotics… will those make me sick? I’ve heard they upset the stomach. I suppose I should ask… is this my fault? Did I not take care of my feet well enough? I’ve tried to follow the doctor’s orders, but it’s hard sometimes to remember everything. It’s all so confusing. I just want to get better, Doctor. Tell me honestly, what are my chances?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Cannington, it is a lot, and it’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let’s address your concerns one by one. The specialists – the podiatrist and vascular surgeon – are experts in their fields. They will work together with me to provide you with the best possible care. Think of them as a team helping you get better. Regarding walking, the goal is to keep you as mobile as possible. The podiatrist will help you find ways to offload the pressure on your foot so you can continue walking, but we might need to limit your activity initially. The local anesthetic is a shot, but it’s a small one, and it numbs the area so you won't feel pain during the debridement. If it doesn’t completely numb the area, we can always add a little more. Antibiotics can sometimes upset the stomach, but we can prescribe medications to help with that. We'll monitor you closely and adjust your medications as needed. And to answer your last question, this is not your fault. Diabetic foot ulcers are a complication of diabetes, and they can happen even if you do everything right. It's a sign that your diabetes is not as well-controlled as it should be, but that’s something we can work on together. As for your chances of getting better, it’s difficult to give you a precise number. It depends on the severity of the ulcer, your overall health, and how well you follow the treatment plan. However, with prompt and consistent care, the majority of patients with diabetic foot ulcers can achieve healing and avoid amputation. We'll start with the blood tests and X-ray, and then we'll schedule appointments with the podiatrist and vascular surgeon. I'm going to write you referrals now. And I’ll give you a list of detailed instructions on how to care for your foot at home. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Home care… that sounds daunting. I'm not very good at all that. My daughter helps me, but she's busy with her own life. What exactly will I need to do? And how often? Will this be expensive? My Medicare covers some things, but I'm worried about the cost of specialists and tests. And what about bandages and special shoes? And one last thing… will this be contagious? I don't want to get anyone else sick. My grandson visits sometimes, and I wouldn't want to worry him. I appreciate you being so patient with me, Doctor. It's just… a lot to take in. I feel like I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Mrs. Cannington. It is a lot, and you’re not alone in feeling that way. Let’s break down the home care, costs, and contagiousness. Regarding home care, it mainly involves keeping the wound clean and dry, changing the bandages as instructed, and protecting your foot from pressure and injury. We'll provide you with detailed instructions and demonstrate how to do it properly. It might take a little practice, but with your daughter’s help, I’m sure you can manage it. The frequency of bandage changes will depend on the type of wound and the amount of drainage, but it will likely be once or twice a day. As for costs, Medicare will cover a significant portion of the tests and specialist visits. However, there might be some out-of-pocket expenses, such as copays and deductibles. Our billing department can help you understand your coverage and explore any financial assistance options that might be available. The cost of bandages and special shoes can vary, but we can work with you to find affordable options. And finally, the ulcer itself is not contagious. It’s caused by bacteria that are already present on your skin, and it cannot be spread to others. However, it’s important to practice good hygiene to prevent infection, such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding sharing personal items. I'm going to print out a detailed home care instruction sheet for you, and I’ll also give you the referrals to the podiatrist and vascular surgeon. We can schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and address any concerns you might have. Remember, we’re a team, and we’re here to support you every step of the way. Now, before you go, do you have any questions about the referrals, the home care instructions, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I still feel anxious, but I feel a little better knowing that there's a plan. I’ll make appointments with the specialists and try my best to follow the instructions. My daughter will help me, she’s very good at all of this. I suppose I should go home now and… get started. It sounds like a lot of work. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Cannington. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Take it one step at a time, and please, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care now, and I’ll see you at your next appointment. .
