DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, to be frank, I don't have time for a lot of chatter. I’m 51, and I want to get pregnant. And I want to make sure it happens without any…complications. Is that possible? I don't want to be wasting my time and yours.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're 51 and hoping to become pregnant, and you want to assess the feasibility and minimize complications. Absolutely. That's a very reasonable goal, and we can certainly explore that. First, let's gather some information. You mentioned your age, which is helpful. Have you been trying to conceive for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not exactly. I just… I want to plan it. Before it’s too late, obviously. I’m not… impulsive. I’ve been divorced for ten years, and frankly, I haven’t really needed to think about this until recently. So, no, I haven’t been ‘trying’. Is that a problem? It feels like you're already questioning my life choices.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It's perfectly fine to plan. In fact, it's ideal. I wasn’t questioning anything, just gathering information to understand your situation better. Ten years divorced – that's good to know. Okay, so no prior attempts to conceive. Have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: Really? You need to know everything, don’t you? No. I have no children. Never wanted them with him. And honestly, it’s none of your business why. But now… now things are different. Are we getting anywhere, or are you just going to keep asking pointless questions? I have appointments to get to, you know.
DOCTOR: You're right to want to be efficient, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive; I simply need a complete picture to provide the best possible care. Knowing your medical history is crucial. Okay, let’s move on. Have you ever been pregnant before, even if it didn’t result in a live birth?
PATIENT: I just told you. No. Never. I’ve never been pregnant. Are you even listening? It’s astounding how many times I have to repeat myself. It's a simple 'no'. I don't understand why you need to ask the same question again. Honestly, this is rather… inefficient.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. My apologies, Ms. Shteynberg. I am listening, and I should be taking better notes. No prior pregnancies. I’m documenting that now. To move forward, could you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What does that even mean? I’m perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise – I walk, mostly. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink. I'm a bicycle repairer, for goodness sake. It's physical work! Do you think someone who's constantly bending and lifting and fixing things would be unhealthy? I fail to see what this has to do with anything. I need a straight answer: can I get pregnant, or not? Stop with the vague inquiries.
DOCTOR: Okay, active lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol – that’s all very positive. And you're right to want a direct answer. Determining if you can get pregnant requires a bit more information, but your current health status is a good start. To proceed, do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Must I list my entire medical history from birth? No. I do not have diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid issues. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu five years ago, and I broke my wrist once when I was a teenager, but that's it. Perfectly normal, healthy woman. This is getting ridiculous. I have Medicare, if that's what you need to know. I assume that covers whatever tests you're going to inflict upon me. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions. Good. And yes, Medicare should cover the necessary tests. To be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Are you serious? A multivitamin, occasionally. And ibuprofen when my hands ache from working on bicycles. Is that enough detail for you? Honestly, this is insulting. I'm not some fragile invalid. I'm a perfectly capable woman who wants to know if she can have a baby. Can we please move this along? I don’t have all day. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if I seem to be taking too long. I assure you, I'm trying to be efficient. Given your age and desire to conceive, we need to consider several factors. While it is possible to get pregnant at 51, it's less common and carries higher risks. We'll need to assess your ovarian reserve with some blood tests, and I'd also like to discuss a pelvic exam and possibly an ultrasound. Is that acceptable?
