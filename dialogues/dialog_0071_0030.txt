DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in… my body odor. It just doesn’t smell like me anymore, if that makes sense. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s… different.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. That is unusual. It's good you brought it up. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four weeks. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, I didn’t notice it right away. I just thought maybe I was working too hard and sweating more, but it’s… not just sweat. It’s like a different smell. Does that make sense? I really don't know how to explain it better.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It's helpful you're describing it that way. Different from your usual odor... Okay. And has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, really. My work hasn’t changed, I’m still laying floors, mostly vinyl these days. My diet… pretty much the same. I haven't started any new medications or anything. Oh! My ex-husband, David, finally moved out of state, about a month ago. Does… stress from that count? It was a relief, honestly. But that was right around the time I noticed it, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a stressful event coinciding with the onset... That's good information. We'll keep that in mind. Now, just to get a better picture, could you describe the smell a little more specifically?
PATIENT: That’s the hard part! It’s… not a bad smell, exactly. It’s just… not me. I usually smell… clean, you know? Like soap. This is… mustier? Kind of like… old books, maybe? It’s faint, thankfully, but I can definitely smell it on my clothes, even after washing. It's hard to describe, I feel like I'm failing here!
DOCTOR: No, you're not failing at all. “Musty,” like old books… that’s a helpful detail, actually. Okay. And where are you noticing it most prominently?
PATIENT: Definitely my underarms. And… sometimes I smell it when I exercise, but not always. It's weird. Like, sometimes I can smell it even without sweating. It's just… present. And sometimes, I think I smell it on my feet too, even with socks. It’s not a strong smell, but I notice it. I've been using extra deodorant, but it doesn't really help.
DOCTOR: Okay. Underarms, sometimes with exercise, occasionally your feet… and extra deodorant isn’t helping. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your skin in those areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. No rashes, no itching, no redness, nothing like that. My skin feels normal. I haven’t noticed any bumps or anything either. I check, because I get a little sensitive sometimes, but everything looks fine. It’s just… the smell. It’s really bothering me. It makes me feel… self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Self-conscious is a very reasonable feeling in this situation. Okay. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. I’m on Medicare, so they usually catch things if there’s a problem.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but that just needed a cast. No other surgeries, no major illnesses, nothing like that. I try to stay active, eat pretty healthy, and I’ve always been lucky with my health. That's why this is so strange. It just came out of nowhere. I’m really worried something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can take penicillin, I've had a few infections over the years, and I haven't had any reactions. No food allergies, no pollen allergies, nothing like that. I can eat anything, take most medications, no problems at all. Honestly, I'm a pretty open book health-wise. That's why this is so confusing!
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Not even over-the-counter stuff regularly. I'll take ibuprofen if I get a headache, but that's about it. I try to avoid medications if I can. I've always been a bit skeptical of them, if I’m honest. I prefer to let my body heal itself, if possible. So, no regular medications at all. Just the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family had any unusual medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a bit complicated. My mother passed away a few years ago from heart disease, which runs in her family. My father had high blood pressure, but he lived a long life. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history. They were in Ethiopia, and we didn't talk about those things much. Nothing that springs to mind as being… unusual, like what we're talking about. Mostly just the usual things – heart disease, high blood pressure, that sort of thing. Nothing about smells, or… anything like this.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So mostly heart disease and high blood pressure. Alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, definitely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked when I was a child, and I hated it, so I swore I'd never touch one. I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year with friends. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I don’t even like coffee! I’m pretty straight-laced, if I’m honest. I take care of myself, I really do. That’s why this smell is so concerning. It's just… so out of character.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. You do seem to take good care of yourself. Now… Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just a general check, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to take a look at your underarms and feet. Just to see if there’s anything obvious going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. That sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I’m really hoping you can figure out what’s going on. It’s just… unsettling. It’s not like me to smell… off. Go ahead, I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No unusual noises there. Now, let's take a look at your underarms. Skin looks normal, no rashes, no redness, no swelling. No tenderness or unusual lumps. And finally, let’s take a look at your feet. Skin is normal, no rashes, no blisters, no signs of fungal infection. No tenderness. Alright. Everything looks normal physically. Which, to be honest, makes this more puzzling.
PATIENT: Okay… so everything looks normal? That’s… frustrating. I was hoping for something to be wrong, so we’d know what to fix. Now what? Is there a test you can do? Maybe a blood test? Or… something to check for… I don't know… weird bacteria? It just doesn't make sense. I’m starting to worry it’s something really serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kerriann. It’s unsettling when everything looks normal, but you’re still experiencing something concerning. You’re right to want to investigate further. There are some things we can explore. A blood test wouldn’t be particularly helpful at this stage, as this isn’t a condition typically indicated by blood markers. However, we can do a skin swab to check for unusual bacteria or fungi, though the chances of finding something are relatively low given the appearance of your skin. There’s also a rare metabolic disorder called trimethylaminuria – sometimes called “fish odor syndrome” – which causes a distinct body odor. It's uncommon, but it's something to consider given your description. We can order a urine test to screen for that, but it's a specialized test and might require referral to a specialist. Would you be comfortable with starting with the skin swab and the urine test for trimethylaminuria?
PATIENT: Okay… a skin swab and a urine test. That sounds good. I mean, I’m willing to try anything at this point. I’d rather rule things out than just… worry about it. And yes, please, if you think the specialist test is a good idea, let’s do that too. I’d rather be thorough. What do I need to do for the tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m just… anxious to find out what’s going on. It’s really affecting my confidence, honestly. I feel like I have to avoid people.
DOCTOR: Alright. For the skin swab, I’ll just gently wipe a cotton swab on your underarm. It doesn’t hurt at all. For the urine test, I’ll give you a collection cup and you’ll need to provide a sample. It's best to give a first morning sample, if possible. I'll give you instructions on how to collect it properly. The skin swab results usually come back in 2-3 business days. The trimethylaminuria test, however, takes longer – usually around 1-2 weeks, as it has to be sent to a specialized lab. I understand your anxiety and wanting answers quickly. I'll expedite the tests as much as possible. In the meantime, I want to reassure you that this is not necessarily a serious condition. Many body odor changes are caused by harmless factors, and we’re simply trying to rule out anything concerning. While we're waiting for the results, continue your usual hygiene routine, but avoid using heavily scented products, as they can sometimes mask symptoms and interfere with the tests. Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable while we wait for the results?
PATIENT: .
