DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's quite simple, Doctor. I woke up this morning and can't hear out of my left ear. And my face… well, it feels a bit droopy on that side too. It’s rather inconvenient, if you must know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, right. Okay. So, sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… how long has this been going on exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me. I told you, I woke up this morning. So, less than 24 hours. It wasn't gradual or anything, it just… was. Is that specific enough for you? I don't spend my days cataloging the precise minutes of my ailments.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Less than 24 hours. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Really, Doctor, are you expecting a parade? No, just the ear and the face. No fever, no headache, no dizziness. Look, I'm a radiologist – I know my body. Something is clearly wrong with my ear and the left side of my face. Do we need to get into how I know, or can we just proceed to figuring out what it is and fixing it?
DOCTOR: A radiologist, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, a radiologist. Which means I'm not some… uninformed patient. I’ve seen plenty of scans in my time. Are you going to ask me if I’ve had any head trauma? Because, frankly, the question is insulting. I assure you, I haven’t been in any accidents. Let’s just skip the elementary questions and get to the point, shall we? Time is precious.
DOCTOR: Fine. No trauma, got it. Any ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Now you’re just fishing. No, there's no ringing. Just… silence. A very unwelcome silence, I might add. Is this standard procedure to ask endless, pointless questions? I'm starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's take a look. Open wide. I need to see your eardrum.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all! Just get it over with. And be gentle, Doctor. I have important appointments later.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Eardrum looks… normal. No visible obstructions. Now, I need you to try and smile for me. And stick your tongue out.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It feels ridiculous. And I still can’t hear properly. Are you sure there's nothing obviously wrong? I’m used to seeing things very clearly on images, and this… this feels like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. There is some slight weakness on the left side. Not dramatic, but present. And your hearing… difficult to assess quickly, but it does seem reduced. We need to rule out a few things. I’m thinking… Bell’s palsy is a possibility, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order an MRI, just to be safe.
PATIENT: An MRI? Really? All this for a bit of deafness and a slightly droopy face? Look, Doctor, I understand caution, but an MRI seems… excessive. I’m a radiologist, remember? I've seen what MRIs expose people to. Is there really a compelling reason, or are you just being overly thorough? And who’s going to pay for this? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns, and your profession. But facial paralysis, even if it looks like Bell's palsy, can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. We need to rule out a tumor, or… other neurological issues. As for cost… the hospital has financial assistance programs. We can look into that. But right now, getting an accurate diagnosis is the priority. I’m ordering the MRI. It’s better to be safe than sorry. And frankly, I'm tired of going over this.
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you must. But I expect a very detailed explanation of the results, and I expect it promptly. And don’t waste my time with unnecessary jargon. I understand medical imaging; I just want to know what’s wrong and what you're going to do about it. And I still expect assistance with the cost. This is… inconvenient, to say the least. Now, when can I expect this MRI? And will it interfere with my schedule? I have a very important conference next week. .
DOCTOR: The MRI scheduler will contact you. They’ll work with your schedule as much as possible. As for results... I’ll explain them to you as clearly as I can, once we have them. Now, if there’s nothing else… .
